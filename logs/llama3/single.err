Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.
The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
