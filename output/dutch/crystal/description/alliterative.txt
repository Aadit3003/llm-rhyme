However, if you want to distinguish between the two words, you may write "ontroomt" as "ontroomt" for the verb "to banish" and "tachisme" as the artistic movement "Tachisme," which is an informal name translating to "suddenism" or "platitude" in French.</s>
Jut, belichtingstechnicus, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

2. "Overlig" - This is the past participle of "overleven," which means "to survive" or "to subsist." The word begins with the short "o" sound (over).

Both words start with the "th" sound, which comes from the combination of 'th' (from tensie) and 'd' (from devils). The other syllables in the words have different sounds, so they are not phonetically identical.</s>
indeuk, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words you provided, "indeuk-esthetiek," do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first word, "indeuk," begins with the sound /ɪn/ and the second word, "esthetiek," begins with the sound /ɛs/. The main consonants that begin the two words are different, which leads to them starting with two unique sounds.</s>

kerstversierselen, koortrans, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the two Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

In the first word, "kerstversierselen" (yule decorations), the first consonant sound is /k/ (represented with the letter 'k'). The second word, "koortrans" (infection with an illness), starts with the consonant sound /k/ (represented with a 'k' as well). The first consonant sounds are not the same.</s>

These Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 'leugenachtigste' begins with the sound of V, while 'legkast' begins with the sound of K.</s>
avondfeesten, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first consonant sound in both Dutch words, "avondfeesten" and "invul", is the same "v" sound. Both words start with the Dutch letter "v", which corresponds to the English "v" sound.</s>

kamerlid, koffietafelde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. Let's analyze each word:

1. kamerlid (noun): The word begins with the sound /k/, as in "cake."
2. koffietafel (noun): The word starts with /k/, as in "cake," too.
3. koffietafelde (adjective): The word starts with /k/, as in "cake."

In Dutch words, the first word, kamerlid, has a clear consonant sound (/k/), while the other two words have a vowel sound (/k/) as well. Therefore, these words do not begin with the same consonant sound.</s>
duif, smadelijkst, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

The first word, "duif," begins with the sound /ˈdyːft/ - [dyːf].

The second word, "smadelijkst," begins with the sound /ˌsmaːdəˈleikəlst/ - [smaːdəleikəlst]. 

The difference between the beginning consonant sounds lies in the combination of voiced and voiceless consonants: "b," "p," and "m" in the first word and "v," "s," "x," "k," and "z" in the second word. Therefore, they do not have the same sound at the beginning.</s>
dijkheemraadschappen, doffertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "dijkheemraadschappen" and "doffertjes" begin with the same consonant sound "d".</s>
computeriseer, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

vochtende, vakwerkconstructies, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

"vochtende" and "vakwerkconstructies" do have the same first consonant sound (a voiceless alveolar affricate, which can be pronounced as /tʃ/ or /ðʒ/), however they both are separate words. Therefore, the answer to your question is No, because they are not part of the same word or phrase.</s>
sciopticons, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

Justification: 

The first word 'sciopticons' begins with a voiced velar fricative ('sci' and 'p') which is followed by a labial-velar fricative ('opticon').

The second word 'vuilpersleiding' starts with a voiced velar stop ('v') followed by a palatal fricative ('uil'). 

The first sound ('sci' and 'v') in both words does not match with the subsequent sounds.</s>
attentie, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "attentie" and "verlichtten" share the consonant sound of /ɑn/. This is represented by the combination 'a' - 'e' in the first word and 'a' - 'n' in the second. Consequently, when you pronounce these words, they start with the same consonant sound.</s>
busbanen, bontstola's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the given Dutch words "busbanen-bontstola's" do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

The word "busbanen" has two distinct sounds: 'b' and 'v'. While, "bontstolas" has only one sound: 'b'. Therefore, they do not begin with the same consonant sound.</s>
doortrapt, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "doortrapt" and "donkerden" begin with the consonant sound /d/.

The justification for this answer is based on the written pronunciation of each word. In the word "doortrapt", "d" is the first consonant sound that is shared with the word "donkerden". Both words also have similar spelling, which could lend support to the correctness of this answer.

Please note that spelling and pronunciation may not necessarily match perfectly. "Doortrapt" might be better pronounced approximately as /doorˌtrapt/ in a Dutch dialect (rather than Standard Dutch which uses some different pronunciation norms). However, considering the spelling, they indeed share the initial consonant sound. The word "donkerden" might have a slightly different pronunciation depending on your dialect or the location you are from, but the initial consonant sound is still the same as in "doortrapt".

Remember, pronunciation varies depending on the dialect and the location of the speaker. So while both words start with the same character 'd', the way the characters 'r', 'a', 'p', 't' translate into sound varies between different speakers' dialects. But for the common Dutch accent, they share the same consonant sound.</s>
moutmeel, morzelen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "moutmeel" and "morzelen," share the same consonant sound at the start of the word. They both begin with the sound of the letter 'm.' The first letter 'm' in both words makes the similar consonant sound, followed by 'outmeel' in the first word and 'orzelen' in the second word, which both have different sounds, but in a different context, they still keep the initial 'm' sound.</s>

These Dutch words do not start with the same consonant sound. The first word, "regio's," begins with the sound "r," while the second word, "roerhardere," begins with the sound "o." The differences in pronunciation and the different consonant sounds used to start each word indicate that they are not the same.</s>
zuiplappen, zonnebaan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

Both words, "zuiplappen" and "zonnebaan" begin with the consonant sound 'z'. The consonant 'z' is the letter that represents the "zh" sound (ex: "church", "lizard"), just in Dutch it's pronounced differently. "Zuiplappen" means "to blow air", and "zonnebaan" means "sun orbit". So, they share the initial 'z' sound which can be compared to English "ch" sound.</s>
Babel, bijscholend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first word, "Babel", starts with the consonant "B", whereas the second word, "bijscholend", starts with the consonant "J".

In summary, the initial consonant sounds in these words are different – "w" in welhebbende and "s" in statica.</s>
roosterkozijn, rennersveld, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

'roosterkozijn' begins with the voiceless and bilabial stop consonant sound 'p', while 'rennersveld' begins with the voiced and labiodental fricative consonant sound 'v'.</s>

machtigere, mekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || To answer your question, I need to first break down the two words you've given:

1. machtigere (adjective from the noun machtiger, meaning "more powerful") - This ends in 'er', which is a weak vowel.
2. mekt (noun) - This word ends with 't', which is a voiced plosive consonant.

Since the last consonant of both words are different, they do not begin with the same consonant sound. Therefore, my answer is:

No.</s>
losstaan, lessende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first consonant sound in both Dutch words is a "l" sound. "Losstaan" means "to surrender" and "lessende" means "diminishing".</s>
planimetreer, wegdropen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "planimetreer-wegdropen" do not begin with the same consonant sound. While both words begin with a "p" sound, the first word "planimetreer" actually starts with a "p-ly" sound ("plan-ly-meer"). In contrast, the second word, which is "wegdropen," begins with the usual "v" sound as in "w-egd-ropen."</s>
duivelsklauw, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

The first word "duivelsklauw" (devil's claw) starts with "d," and the second word "voorlieg" (foreground) starts with "v." The initial consonant sound in these Dutch words is different.</s>
zondagssluiting, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "zondagssluiting" and "esthetiek," begin with the same consonant sound: "z" (voiced postalveolar fricative).

luchtleidingen, losstaan, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "luchtleidingen" and "losstaan" do not share the same consonant sound at the beginning of the word. While "luchtleidingen" means "air ducts" in English, "losstaan" means "to stand up against" or "to resist" in English. The first letter "l" in "luchtleidingen" and the first letter "l" in "losstaan" may sound similar, but their pronunciation is different; "luchtleidingen" is pronounced as "lootlideeng-ins" and "losstaan" is pronounced as "lohsstån". The similar initial consonant "l" is just a coincidence and is due to the phonetic similarities between languages. They are not equivalent in meaning and are derived from different word roots.</s>
roerhardere, rijksacademien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words are "roerhardere-rijksacademien," and both of them share the same initial consonant sound. The common starting sound is "r."</s>
binnenvaartuigen, bundeltje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The words "binnenvaartuigen" (inner watercraft) and "bundeltje" (a small bundle) both begin with the same consonant sound, which is represented by the letter "b" in the Dutch language.</s>
kappersaus, kinkhoren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

'Kappersaus' begins with the consonant 'k' and 'k' sounds similar to 'p' in English. 

On the other hand, 'kinkhoren' begins with the consonant 'k' but sounds different from English 'k'.

So, there is no matching consonant sound at the beginning of these Dutch words.</s>
landbeer, leemaarde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both Dutch words, "landbeer" and "leemaarde" begin with a "l" consonant sound. In Dutch, the "l" sound is often described as a "soft" or diaeresis sound (e.g., like in the word "gel" which has a double "e" or "leem" like in "leemte"). Thus, the "l" sound in both "landbeer" and "leemaarde" is considered the same.</s>

Justification:
- In the word "zendamateurs," the initial consonant sound is "z" as in "zee" or "zit."

So, they do not have the same consonant sound at the beginning.</s>
wildspiegels, wafelvormigere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both words, "wildspiegels" and "wafelvormigere," have the same starting consonant sound - "w." This distinguishes them from other Dutch words, as the initial consonant in each word is pronounced differently in other combinations. To determine if two Dutch words begin with the same sound, it's essential to analyze their initial consonants.</s>

joysticks, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'joysticks-aanvijl' both begin with the consonant sound of "j". The first word 'joysticks' begins with "j" (a Spanish originated borrowing), while the second word 'aanvijl' is a Dutch term for 'guideposts' that begins with a different consonant sound, "an", hence making the word pair share the same consonant sound at the beginning.</s>
ingestelde, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "ingestelde" and "aanvijl" do not begin with the same consonant sound. They have different consonant sounds at the beginning. "Ingestelde" begins with an "i" sound, and "aanvijl" begins with an "a" sound.</s>
dichtmaken, donderachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These two Dutch words, "dichtmaken" and "donderachtigste," do not begin with the same consonant sound. To compare their first consonant sounds, we would need to analyze the sound of "d" in both words.

"Dichtmaken" begins with the consonant sound [dɪxtmaəkən], while "donderachtigste" begins with the consonant sound [dɔnṿərəxˈtiɡstə].

In summary, the first consonant "d" in these words sounds slightly different, as indicated by the different schwa vowel (ə) representations. Therefore, the answer is No.</s>

lijkende, lacto-vegetarier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "lijkende" and "lacto-vegetarier", have a "k" sound as their initial consonant. In English, the two words would translate as "similar" and "lacto-vegetarian," respectively. So, the consonant similarity in these Dutch words is indeed present.</s>
tensie, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "tensie" and "indeuk" begin with the same consonant sound, which is a 't' sound. Specifically, when followed by "s" and "c" respectively. This is due to the Dutch language's consistent naming convention where 't' is pronounced in words like 'tensie'. The word "indeuk" also includes the same 't' sound and it's pronounced 'in-deuk'. This is a common practice in the way Dutch language uses consonants to form words.</s>
marcheroute, mekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first three consonant sounds in "marcheroute" and "mekt" are the same - /m/. "mar-cher-oute" starts with /m/, while "mekt" starts with /m/ as well.</s>

etnisch, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "etnisch-aanvijl" and "etnisch," begin with the consonant sound of "E."

Justification: Both the words start with the sound - specifically, the voiceless alveolar stop 'E' as denoted by 'etnisch' in Dutch. The hyphen is just a separator for the "-aanvijl" suffix. This is one important fact to note while checking whether words start with the same consonant sound or not.</s>
versmaat, valsmunters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "versmaat-valsmunters," both begin with the consonant sound of "v." Additionally, they share a common consonant sound with the "v" in the word "versmaat."</s>
wijwatervat, wolfskuil, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the two Dutch words "wijwatervat" and "wolfskuil" do not begin with the same consonant sound.

"Wijwatervat" begins with the "w" sound. It comes from the word "water" which means "water" and it contains the vowel "i", "j" sound and another vowel "water" together gives the "w" sound.

while "Wolfskuil" begins with the "w" sound again. it comes from the word "wolf" which means "wolf" and it also contains the vowel "j" sound and another vowel "skuil" together gives the "w" sound. 

so both words start with different consonant sounds( "w" in "Wijwatervat" and "w" in "Wolfskuil").</s>
dubbelsprongen, doodgeergerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

"Dubbelsprongen" begins with the consonant sound "d," and 
"Doodgeergerde" begins with the consonant sound "d" as well. However, because of the pronunciation (as in English), they do share a similar consonant sound spelled out phonetically. The difference is "Doodgeergerde" has that added "D" between Ge and er that makes the vowel sound different.</s>
meetlinten, melkkuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

- "meetlinten" begins with the consonant ́ḿ.

kelderdeur, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "kelderdeur" and "zondagssluiting," begin with the same consonant sound. The consonant sound in both words is 'k'. 

"Kelderdeur" is a Dutch word which is transliterated into English as "cellar door." It consists of the consonants 'k', 'l', 'e', and 'd', and the vowels 'e' followed by a diphthong 'ur'.

"Zondagssluiting" is another Dutch term, meaning "Sunday closing." It begins with the consonants 'z', 'o', 'n', 'd', and 'g', and the vowels 's', 'l', 'u', 'i', 't', and 'i'. 
In both cases, the first consonant is 'k' or 'z', which are pronounced the same way. Thus, the answer to the question is 'Yes' because both Dutch words start with the same consonant sound 'k' or 'z'.</s>
maatregel, meekrijgt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words - "maatregel" and "meekrijgt" - begin with the same consonant sound. "Maatregel" is spelled "m" (as in "man"), and "meekrijgt" begins with "m" (as in "money").</s>

In "jut-uitrokend" (/juyt ûtrokənd/), the first syllable "jut" starts with /d/, and its subsequent pronunciation is /t-/ (/jut/). The second part, "uitrokend" (/ûtərokənd/), also begins with /d/. In this word, the pronunciation of "uit" is /uyt/, followed by the /d/ sound.

In "gevuld" (/gəfvult/), the word starts with /d/, and the pronunciation of "gev" is /g/. The next consonant in this word is also /d/.</s>

These two Dutch words, "regio's-rechtstoestanden," do not share the same consonant sound at the beginning. The first word, "regio's," begins with the sound "r," while the second, "rechtstoestanden," begins with the sound "ch." The difference in the first consonant makes these two words distinct from each other.</s>
lijmerigste, lafste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
koelkamer, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
woudduivel, wegvretend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: The two Dutch words you provided, "woudduivel" and "wegvretend," both begin with the consonant "w." Both words have the same consonant sound as "w," which is the characteristic sound at the beginning of the first syllable of each word. Additionally, both words contain the letter "w" in the same position, which further supports the conclusion that they begin with the same consonant sound.</s>
weergeving, wolkachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "weergeving" and "wolkachtigste" begin with the same consonant sound: w. The word "weergeving" means "representation", while "wolkachtigste" means "most cloud-like." These words have a similar structure, starting with the same consonant sound and followed by different vowels and endings.</s>
doopheffer, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "doopheffer" and "donkerden" begin with the consonant sound of "d." Both words start with the same consonant, which is "d," and have a different meaning, with "doopheffer" meaning "loudspeaker" and "donkerden" meaning "darken."</s>
uitreikend, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. "Uitreikend" begins with the consonant sound of 'ou' (as in "you"), while "voorlegt" begins with the consonant sound of 'v' (as in "van"). These words have distinct consonant sounds at the start of the words.</s>
planimetreer, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes and no. The Dutch words "planimeter" and "kerkering" do indeed begin with the same consonant sound "pl," but they are related to different concepts. "Planimeter" comes from the word "planimètre" which literally means a measuring equipment used to take a plan measurement. It is mainly used in architecture, science, and navigation. 

On the other hand, "kerkering" is the past participle of the verb "kerkeren" meaning (to) imprison in Dutch. So the words have entirely different meanings and they have a different consonant sound.</s>
korzeliger, kampongs, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words korzeliger-kampongs do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first word, "korzeliger," begins with a 'k' sound, while the second word, "kampongs," begins with a 'k' sound as well, but in this case, the 'k' is followed by an 'o' sound. The first vowel sound doesn't match at the beginning of the words, which leads to different consonant blends.</s>
voorlieg, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of these Dutch words, "voorlieg-blauwbekkend," begin with the same consonant sound.

In this word, the first two consonant sounds are the same: "v" and "b". Both of them create the same sound as you would produce in English while saying "vet" or "bat". This is a simple comparison and doesn't consider word meanings, but in terms of sound, they align perfectly.</s>
kwintalen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "kwintalen-ontroomt" and "kwintalen-ontvangt" both begin with the same consonant sound, "k". This is because in both words, the 'k' appears as the first letter and also starts the root of one of the words, creating the same consonant sound to begin the words.</s>
zemelknoopte, zielroerender, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "zemelknoopte" (zêmelknoopte) and "zielroerender" (zêlroerender) have the same consonant sound at the beginning. The consonant sound is "z" and it is written as "z" in both words.</s>
uitrokend, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "uitrokend" and "invul" begin with the same consonant sound. Both words, spelled "u" - "r" - "o" - "k" - "e" - "n" - "t" in "uitrokend" and "i" - "n" - "v" - "u" - "l" in "invul," both start with the same consonant sound of "u".</s>
ritshouten, raagbollen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words - 'ritshouten' and 'raagbollen' - begin with the same consonant sound of 'r'. 'Ritshouten' is the Dutch word for "noise ceremony," while 'raagbollen' translates to "rag balls." The first letter, 'r,' is the same in both words, and they have different meanings, but the first letter remains the same consonant sound.</s>
attentie, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first consonant in both words, "attentie" and "indeuk," is "t."</s>
lijkende, loonde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

- "lijkende" begins with the "j" consonant sound.
- "loonde" begins with the "l" consonant sound.</s>
valbuis, voorlaatst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "valbuis" and "voorlaatst" begin with the consonant sound /v/. Here's a short explanation:

valbuis: 'val-buis' contains two syllables - 'val' and 'buis', which sounds like 'bal-bouy in English. The first syllable, 'val' starts with the consonant sound /v/ in both languages.

voorlaatst: 'voor-laatst' starts with the consonant /v/ again. 'voor' can be translated as 'for' in English, and 'laatst' translates to 'last.' So, /v/ appears twice in this word.

Therefore, both the words 'valbuis' and 'voorlaatst' begin with the same consonant sound.</s>
loodwitfabriek, lerarende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both the Dutch words "loodwitfabriek" and "lerarende" begin with the "l" consonant sound.</s>
liefkozend, larken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "liefkozend" and "larken," begin with the same consonant sound. Both words have the initial consonant "l."</s>

piepjongst, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words begin with the same consonant sound, which is /p/. In English, you may pronounce the first word "peep young st" and the second word "planimetry er". If you compare their sounds, you can notice that it starts with "p". The first word "piepjongst" is a compound of "piep" (whistle), "jong" (young), and "st" (a guttural sound like in the word "stamp"), it's meaning is unclear. The second word "planimetreer" is a Dutch spelling of "planimeter" and has the meaning of "planimeter user".</s>
lijkende, liefkozend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "lijkende" (like) and "liefkozend" (affectionate) begin with different consonant sounds at the start. "Lijkende" starts with the "l" sound, while "liefkozend" starts with the "f" sound.</s>
woelige, weergeving, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words, "woelige-weergeving," do not begin with the same consonant sound since the first word, "woelige," begins with the soft guttural "w" while the second word, "weergeving," starts with the voiced velar "g" sound.</s>
etnisch, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both words "etnisch-toerekent" and "etnisch-terugkent" are valid Dutch words and begin with the same consonant sound. The sound in both cases is 'a' as in father, pronounced /ā/. This is followed by the 't' sound in both words, so the full pronunciation is like "ate-en-shi-top-er-kent" or "ate-en-shi-ter-yuh-kent" and similar for "ate-en-shi-ter-yuh-gkent."</s>
nachtcremes, nawerpt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
parkachtige, petekinderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "parkachtige" and "petekinderen" do not begin with the same consonant sound. "Parkachtige" begins with a "p" sound, while "petekinderen" begins with a "p" sound as well but pronounced as "p'tje kinderen."</s>
loopgravenstelling, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "loopgravenstelling" and "jut" begin with the consonant sound of "j." This is due to "loopgravenstelling" being derived from "jut," which is the English word for "dip of a hill." The "j" sound is produced in both languages through the laryngealization of the uvular trill [r].</s>
ontruimt, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "ontruimt" and "aanvijl," do begin with the same consonant sound. However, please note that "aanvijl" is spelled with the letter "l" at the end of the word, but according to Dutch phonetics, the proper pronunciation has a silent "l" at the end, which doesn't impact sound contrast.</s>
antwoordend, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

The Dutch words "antwoordend-esthetica" do not begin with the same consonant sound. "Antwoordend" begins with the consonant "a," while "esthetica" begins with the consonant "e."</s>
invul, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

While both "invul-" and "blauwbekkend" share a common prefix which in this case begins with the "v" sound, the main word associated with "invul" is "blauw," which is pronounced as "play" in English. This results in a different consonant sound at the beginning of the word.</s>
busziek, bijzettende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
piepjongst, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words begin with the same consonant sound: "p" (pronounced as "p"). Let's break down the two words for better understanding:

1. "Piepjongst-": In this part of the word, it begins with "p." The combination "jongst" is a suffix added to the word "piep," which translates to "lively" or "noisy." Hence, the whole Dutch word means "lively" or "noisy" in English, as in the "Piepjongst-" part.

2. "Tachisme": In "tachisme," the first letter is also "p," but the pronunciation is not the same as "piep" in "Piepjongst-." "Tachisme" is a term used to describe a trend in art that was prominent in the 1950s. Here, "tachisme" refers to the act or practice of painting a picture with great rapidity, leaving an impression of speed in the painted line. Thus, the "P" sound in "Tachisme" is related to the "p" in "piep," but they are not identical in pronunciation.</s>
plantluis, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "Jut" both begin with the consonant sound "p." The spelling may differ, but the roots of both words share the same phonetic beginning.

"Plantluis" means "gardener," while "Jut" (also transcribed as 'Jutje' or 'Jütje') is a diminutive form of "Gertrude," which appears to be a girl's name from various European languages. Hence, though pronunciation of the word "jo" is common, the word "Plantluis" is pronounced with a short 'p' as opposed to 'jo,' and "Jutje" is also with 'p' due to 'Plantluis'. This explains why the Dutch words both commence with a 'p' regardless of their spellings.</s>
landbouwarbeidswetten, laagvormigst, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These are two different words. The first word, "landbouwarbeidswetten," has a different first consonant sound with "l" and "s" (landbo-uwarbeidswet-ten). The second word, "laagvormigst," also has "l" and "s" as first consonants, but the meaning of the word is unclear. 

If they are intended to be combined with each other or with other words meaning "low" (in various contexts) then they might make sense. For example:

- "landbouw" (agriculture) + "arbeid" (work) + "swetten" (laws) + "laagvormigst" (low in form) would be "landbouwlaagvormigearbeidswetten" or "low-form agriculture work laws". 

You have to check the context again or consult a dictionary to confirm. This might be a play on words in the Dutch language but it sounds very unusual when you see it written. It's unclear without more context.</s>
kielvlakken, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
verluchtten, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds that begin the given Dutch words "verluchtten" and "nadook" are both /v/ (as in the English word "hot").</s>
turkten, tinteloogt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words do share the same consonant sound at the beginning. The first consonant of "turkten-tinteloogt" is 't', which is also the first consonant in "turkten" and "tinteloogt". This common initial consonant sound in the given Dutch words makes them sound like one word - "turktinteloogt".</s>
lispen, larken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words both begin with the consonant sound of "l". The words "lispen" and "larken" are pronounced [lispen] and [larken] respectively, where "l" is the initial consonant sound in both words.</s>
buffers, buitenbanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words you provided, "buffers" and "buitenbanden", begin with the same consonant sound "b". This is because "b" is the first letter of both words.</s>
meridionaal, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words begin with the same consonant sound:

- Meridionaal: In Dutch, "meridionaal" has the consonant sound "m."
- Duivelsklauwen: In Dutch, "duivelsklauwen" has the consonant sound "d." 

Thus, the shared consonant sound is "d," and both words start with a "d."</s>
lucifersmerken, lacto-vegetarier, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words 'lucifersmerken' and 'lacto-vegetarier' do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

1. 'lucifersmerken' starts with the consonant 'l', which is pronounced as 'lee' in English.
2. 'lacto-vegetarier' also starts with 'l', but this 'l' is pronounced closer to 'r'. However, as it is an older form of 'lacto', the 'l' is pronounced more like 'le' in English. 

So, they both have 'l' initial sound in their words but not exactly the same.</s>

boorgaten, bijgepunte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words indeed begin with the same consonant sound. Both 'boorgaten' and 'bijgepunte' start with the "b" or "p" sound. So, in simple words, they both begin with the same 'b' or 'p' in English.</s>
welhebbende, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These two Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. "Welhebbende" begins with the consonant sound "v" and "Ontroomt" begins with the consonant sound "o".</s>
lispen, lendeberoerte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds at the beginning of both words, 'lispen' and 'lendeberoerte', are the same. The common consonant is 'l'.</s>
haverpluim, hockeyclubs, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "haverpluim" and "hockeyclubs" do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

Haverpluim is pronounced ["hăvərplʏm"], where the 'h' and 'r' are clearly distinct consonant sounds. In contrast, "hockeyclubs" starts with "h", which is a different consonant sound than "h" in the word "haverpluim." So, the beginning consonant sounds for both words are different, and they are not alike.</s>
sciopticons, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "sciopticons-invul" both begin with the consonant sound of /s/. Both words have an "s" letter as their first letter which makes the first consonant the same sound.</s>

lieveling, lekhoning, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words lieveling-lekhoning begin with the same consonant sound. They both start with the "l" sound, which is a voiceless labiodental fricative.

lieveling, levenswerkelijkheid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "lieveling" and "levenswerkelijkheid," both begin with the same consonant sound.

Both words begin with the letter "l" as a consonant sound, making the same first sound for each word.</s>
koelkamer, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

Explanation: 
"Koelkamer" begins with the consonant sound "k" as in "kraken" or "kind" whereas "zenuwpijn" begins with the consonant sound "z" as in "zoekt" or "zo" in English. Therefore, these words do not start with the same consonant sound.</s>
vouwblinden, voorlaatst, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

- "vouwblinden" (folding blinds) begins with the "v" sound
- "voorlaatst" (last of all) begins with the "v" sound too but "v" is pronounced in a different way: "fr" 

So they only share the same initial consonant in "vou" and even though both are "v" sounds, they are not exactly the same.</s>
lijkende, levenswerkelijkheid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words begin with the same consonant sound: /l/

'lijkende' and 'levenswerkelijkheid' are both Dutch words. 'lijkende' translates to 'similar' in English and means 'having a similar quality or character' while 'levenswerkelijkheid' translates to 'authentic-living'. Both words start with the consonant 'l' which produces the same sound.</s>

The second word, "donkerden," has a different sound: "d" (voiced alveolar plosive), "on" (voiced alveolar nasal), "k" (voiced velar fricative), "er" (voiced pharyngeal approximant), and "den" (voiced palatal approximant).

Therefore, they don't begin with the same consonant sound.</s>
kamercommissies, korzeliger, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

Kamercommissies starts with the sound /k/ (/kɛmərkɔməsjeːs/), while korzeliger starts with the sound /k/ (/kɔrˈzeːlɪkər/). The first letter "k" is present only in the first word, so they do not have the same initial consonant sound altogether.</s>
roofdierachtig, reddinggordel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words begin with the same consonant sound. Both "roofdierachtig" and "reddinggordel" start with the consonant sound of /r/ - a short, closed or nasalized sound.

doemdenker, doodrijdend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These words, "doemdenker" (thinker) and "doodrijdend" (drowning), do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

The first word, "doemdenker" is derived from the Dutch words "doem," meaning "shut," and "denker," which means "thinker." The first consonant sound of the root word "doem" is "d" (as in "dog"). In contrast, the first consonant sound of the word "doodrijdend" is actually "d" (as in "dog" or "drowning"), but it is pronounced differently and comes from the combining form "dood" (meaning "death") and the root word "-rijdend" (meaning "riding"). So, although both begin with a "d" sound, the words are distinct from each other.</s>
barkelners, busbanen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
radiostraling, reddingstoestellen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words begin with the consonant sound 'r'. The words are "radio straling" (radiostraling) and "reddingstoestellen" (reddingstoestellen). The 'r' sound is present at the beginning of each word.</s>
heksenbezem, hockeyclubs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Dutch words are made up of a combination of consonant sounds and vowel sounds. Words can share similar sounds or be easily understood if one has knowledge of the Dutch language or phonetic transcriptions. However, this doesn’t mean words will necessarily have the exact same consonant sound at the beginning. In this case, both "heksenbezem" and "hockeyclubs" indeed begin with the same consonant sound, which is 'h' (pronounced as 'h' in the English word "has").</s>
kerkerende, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>

kerkerende, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words 'kerkerende' and 'invul' do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

'Kerkerende' contains the word "kijk" (meaning "to gaze" or "to look"), which starts with the consonant "k" sound.

'Invul' (meaning "to fill" or "to encompass") starts with a voiceless fricative sound made by constricting air in the vocal tract and expelling it as a hissing sound. In standard Dutch, it is commonly pronounced as 'in-fool' or 'een-fool'. 

Therefore, they start with different sounds, which is why the answer to the question is No.</s>
busbanen, bijscholend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

- J in "jut" (jut, a kind of fish) is a pharyngeal fricative, as in the middle of "ch" in "church."

The initial consonant sounds in "Jut" are different from the initial consonant sounds in "Piepjongste," which means "squirrel" in English. Therefore, these words do not begin with the same consonant sound.</s>
jut, computeriseer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first word, "jut-computeriseer," begins with the consonant sound spelled "j" or "zh".

Therefore, the two words start with different initial consonant sounds.</s>
meridionaal, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "meridionaal" and "tachisme" both begin with the consonant sound of /m/ (in this case, the letter m). This is determined by analyzing their English phonetic pronunciations:

- "meridionaal": /merəˈdjoʊ.na.ŋoʊ/
- "tachisme": /tækˈɪzəm/

As you can see that both words, starting with 'm', they are pronounced the same in English.

So the answer is yes these dutch words "meridionaal" and "tachisme" do indeed begin with the same consonant sound, /m/ (m).</s>
kerkerende, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words kerkerende-esthetiek do not begin with the same consonant sound because the first word has the sound "k" and the second word has the sound "e," so the first letter "k" and "e" have distinct consonant sounds.</s>

Both words share the "d" sound at the beginning, which is why the answer is yes.</s>
ontroomt, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words you provided - 'ontroomt' and 'registratierechten' - indeed begin with the same consonant sound. The first sound in these words is 'o', as they are formed from the Latin root 're' combined with distinctive Dutch prefixes: 'ont-' and 'reg-.'. Here's a basic explanation:

- "Ont-" - This prefix means "to expel" in various contexts such as "ontroomt", which means "to expel someone from an organization" or "ontreinigen", which means "to clean expel stains".

- "Reg-" - This prefix has multiple meanings in the English language. 're(g)-' has a variety of meanings including "rec", re-growth of some sort (like "regrow"), the root 're' (like "refer", "regret"), or the suffix 'reg-' (like "registration").

Both prefixes are made of 'o' combined with the 'reg-' root from Latin re-, which is used to develop a variety of 're-' words in various contexts. This sound 'o' is the same in both words.</s>

In Dutch, these words would be pronounced with a 'v' sound because they both contain an 'n' and 'l' that are not used in the vowel sounds, but these letters have a different consonant sound in the beginning of the words. Thus, the consonant sound in these words is not a straightforward English vowel like "a" or "i".</s>

However, "race" and "race-versmallen" sound different because they have different vowel sounds between "race" and the dash.</s>
weergeving, waterski's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "weergeving" and "waterski's" both begin with the consonant sound 'w'. 

"Weergeving" means "presentation" in English and it is pronounced as 'wai-er-gee-vin' 

"Waterski's", translates to "water skis" in English, is pronounced as 'wahr-skier' 

You can just hear 'w' sound at the very start, so they start with the same consonant sound 

So, it would be a "Yes" answer and no this is not because 'w' is the letter at the beginning and the sound is the same. The similarity is there.</s>
wachtwoord, waag, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, 'wachtwoord-waag' both begin with the consonant sound of "w". 'Wachtwoord' and 'waag' both start with the "w" sound. Please note that the words are Dutch, the writing system is different than English, so the written word may seem different however the pronunciation is the same – 'w-a-ch-t-o-o-d' and 'w-a-g'.</s>

Let's break down the words: 

1. P - The first word, "piepjongst" begins with the consonant P.

Therefore, they don't form the same sound at the beginning.</s>
satansboleten, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words provided, "satansboleten" and "vorlieg," do not begin with the same consonant sound. "Satansboleten" begins with the sound of "s" (voiced sibilant) and "vorlieg" begins with the sound of "f" (voiceless).</s>
Jut, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first consonant sound in both words is "j". So, we can match the first letters of these words: 

1. "J" in the word "jut" (which could be pronounced like the English /ju/ sound, or /jut/).
2. "D" in the word "duivelsklauwen" (which is a direct Dutch translation of a vulgar anglicism which roughly means "devil's claws").</s>

kuitharing, koepelvormiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first word, "kuitharing" (cheek ring), starts with the [k] sound, while the second word, "koepelvormiger" (domed form), starts with the [k] sound as well, but with a palatalized consonant [x]. The palatalization of the consonant [k] is pronounced as [x] in the second word, which gives it a unique sound when compared to the first word. These differences in the consonant sounds result in them not beginning with the same consonant in Dutch.</s>
thermisch, tinteloogt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

- "thermisch" begins with the /θ/ sound, where "t" is an alveolar trill or tap, which is represented phonetically as /θ/ in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).
- "tinteloogt" begins with the /t/ sound, where "t" is a dental tap. This is represented in the IPA as /t/.

So, the beginning consonant sounds of these words are /θ/ and /t/, respectively.</s>

dubbelsprongen, datje, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These words, dubbelsprongen and datje, do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first and last letters in Dutch, dubbelsprongen (meaning "double jump" in English) are 'd.' In datje (which means "little bottle" in English), the first and last letters are 'd' as well. However, there is an essential difference in the initial consonant sound: dubbelsprongen starts with a voiceless alveolar plosive (/t/), while datje begins with a voiced alveolar plosive (/d/).</s>
leugenachtigste, liefkozend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words do begin with the same consonant sound. They begin with the sound of the letter "l" as in "laugh". So, the Dutch words leugenachtigste and liefkozend share the same first consonant sound, which is an "l" sound.</s>

lispen, losgespende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "lispen" and "losgespende," begin with the consonant sound of "l". The first consonant "l" is the same in both words.</s>

larken, levensverschijnselen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first consonant sound in both Dutch words "larken" and "levensverschijnselen" is the letter "L". So, they begin with the same consonant sound.</s>
quintolen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "quintolen" and "esthetica" both begin with the consonant sound "k" or "k" as a silent letter. This is because both words share the same root in the Germanic language family, and the common ancestor for English, Dutch, and other Germanic languages has a "k" sound at that position in their vocabulary.</s>
evocerend, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'evocerend-voorlieg' do begin with the same consonant sound, which is a "v" (voiced velar plosive) sound.

Here's the transcription to provide further context:
- 'Evocerend' has a voiced velar plosive "v" (ev-o-cer-end)

luchtleidingen, leraarden, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "luchtleidingen" (air ducts) and "leraarden" (chalkboards) do not begin with the same consonant sound.

Justification:
"Lucht" (air) is the only Dutch word that begins with the common English consonant sound "l", so it shares the same consonant sound with "luchtleidingen." However, "leraarden" starts with the "l" sound as well, but it is pronounced "lee-rahr" (or "lee-ra-ren") and "luchtleidingen" is "loost-lee-jeed-in" to start with 'loud' like 'loud' in 'loud and clear'.</s>
antwoordend, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, antwoordend and sciopticons, begin with the same consonant sound. Both words begin with the consonant "s," making them share the same initial sound.</s>
warrelig, watertanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "warrelig" and "watertanden" begin with the same consonant sound. In these words, the consonant sound is: 

- In "warrelig" (war-REL-ee), the "w" sound is the first consonant.
- In "watertanden" (wah-TUR tahnd-ə), the "w" sound occurs in the first word and "t" sound occurs in the second word. 

Thus, both these words start with the same consonant sound, which in this case is "w" or "wahr".</s>
roep, rijpaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words (roep-rijpaard) begin with the same consonant sound. In this case, it is a voiceless plosive [p].</s>
piepjongst, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "piepjongst-wegdruip," do begin with the consonant sound "p." However, please note that these words are misspelled and should be spelled as "peipjongst-wieddruip" (peepjongst-väyddruip) based on the Dutch language diacritical rules and spelling standards. The correct Dutch version of the words is "peepjongst" (peepjongst) and "wieddruip" (väyddruip).</s>
rentetarieven, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "rentetarieven" and "nadook" begin with the same consonant sound. They both start with the consonant 'r'.</s>
onneembaarder, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

tensie, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tensie, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words share the same consonant sound at the beginning, as "t" in both "tensie" and "duivelsklauw" is pronounced similarly.</s>
schreeuweriger, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "schreeuweriger" and "vuilpersleiding," begin with the same consonant sound, which is a "s" sound. "Schreeuweriger" means "loudmouthed" or "more vocal" in Dutch, and "vuilpersleiding" means "sewer pipe" or "municipal drain pipe."</s>
Jut, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "Jut-toerekent" do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

The first word, "Jut-toerekent," begins with the phoneme /ʒ/ (short for "j" in English). However, it should be noted that this word doesn't actually contain the letter "J" or "j." Instead, it seems to be the result of a transcription error.

The second word, "Jut-toerekent," begins with the phoneme /t/ (short for "t" in English). Again, this word uses the letter combination "JT" which is unusual in Dutch and may be a typing error. The correct Dutch word "toerekent", written phonetically should be "toerent" since the "k" is written with a tilde.</s>
belichtingstechnicus, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first word, "belichtingstechnicus," begins with the /b/ sound, while the second word, "aanvijl," begins with the /a/ sound. This difference in the initial consonant sound makes them unrelated.</s>

doodgeergerde, doffiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both Dutch words 'doggeerde-doffiger' start with the same consonant sound 'd' followed by two different vowels, 'o' and 'u'. The first word has a diphthong sound of 'oo', the second has a single 'u'. They share the same consonant sound but with differences in the following vowel sounds which vary in sound and pronunciation.</s>
attentie, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "attentie-rotacisme" begin with the same consonant sound. Attentie-rotacisme can be analyzed phonetically as "at-ten-tei-rot-a-si-em" where "at" is a consonant. 

Both words are adjectives describing attentie (hearing, attentiveness, heedfully) and rotacisme (la-rot-a-si-ze) which represents a rotational movement and is often used as a neutral term for turning or rotation. 

"Attentie-rotacisme" can be understood as referring to the need for attentive orientation (in this case to rotation), which could potentially indicate a form of paying attention to rotational motion instead of stationary or static perspectives.

The other Dutch word is "Attentie" and it refers to attention, or the act of being attentive.</s>
attentie, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

The word "attentie" begins with the "a" sound, while the other word, "uitrokend," begins with the "u" sound.</s>
zonnebaan, zaadlobben, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zonnebaan" and "zaadlobben" both begin with the consonant sound "z". 

The first word, "zonnebaan", which translates to "solar orbit" or "solar path" in English, begins with the consonant "z" in the Dutch language. The word "zonnebaan" consists of two syllables, "z" and "onnebaan". Similarly, the second word, "zaadlobben", meaning "seed pods" in English, also begins with the consonant "z".

The "z" sound is represented by the voiceless postalveolar affricate /ts/ in the Dutch language, similar to the /ts/ sound in the word "butter." Both of these words are also written with the same letter "z" in both Dutch and English, which contributes to the similarity in their initial consonant sound.</s>
plantluis, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words, "plantluis" and "voorlieg," do not begin with the same consonant sound. Let's break them down:

1. "plantluis": The first consonant sound in "plantluis" is "p," which is also the first consonant sound in "plant."
2. "voorlieg": The first consonant sound in "voorlieg" is "v," not the same as "p" in "plantluis." The first consonant sound in "voor" is "v." 

Therefore, these words do not start with the same consonant sound, so the answer is No.</s>

vat, voortboomden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vat" and "voortboomden" both begin with the consonant sound of "v".</s>

These two Dutch words do start with the same consonant sound. Both words, "huidworm" and "hockeyclubs," begin with the "h" sound, which is a voiceless velar plosive. This sound is made at the back of the throat by partially blocking the airflow and then releasing it forcefully.</s>
plantluis, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, sweetie. Both Dutch words "plantluis" (meaning "little plant") and "vergokte" (meaning "roasted" or "baked") begin with a consonant sound. Both words start with a P (plantluis-plant) which makes them sound similar at the beginning.</s>
wedergaf, wolfskuil, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first word, "wedergaf" begins with the /j/ sound, and the second word, "wolfskuil" begins with the /w/ sound.</s>

penhamers, pufheter, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

Penhamers begins with the /ɛn/ sound, while Pufheter begins with the /p/ sound. The difference between these two consonants is significant: /ɛn/ and /p/ are both vowel sounds and consonants, respectively, and are not the same.</s>
machtigere, mentrix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "machtigere" and "mentrix" both begin with the sound of the letter "m". They are indeed semantically related Germanic nouns, as noted in the dictionary entries, machtigere(n) "more powerful" and mentrix "witch". The "-er-" comes from the cognate "-er" in German, where "-er" comes from (-r) in Dutch. Therefore, they clearly share the same starting consonant sound.</s>
trompetboom, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
warrelig, waaghalzerige, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

etnisch, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first consonant sound of both words is "t". The Dutch word "etnisch-tachisme" can be broken down as: 
- "etnisch" comes from the Dutch word "etnisch," meaning "ethnic."
- "tachisme" comes from the English word "-chisme," which describes gossip, rumor-mongering, or any form of rumor-based innuendo and slander. In Dutch, it is transliterated as "-tachisme."</s>
valsmunters, vuistregel, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
koffietafelde, kappersaus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "koffietafelde" and "kappersaus" begin with the same consonant sound, which is "k".</s>
tensie, kielvlakken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the first word "tensie" does not begin with the same consonant sound as the second word "kielvlakken". In Dutch, "tensie" is pronounced as [ˈtɛnsi] while "kielvlakken" is pronounced as [ˈkiːlʋlɑkən]. The first word starts with the consonant sound "t" while the second word starts with the consonant sound "k".</s>

penningplaten, petekinderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "penningplaten" and "petekinderen" do not begin with the same consonant sound.

Justification:

In English, "penning" means "money," while "platen" means "plates." Together, they form the phrase "money plates." Comparing this to "petekinderen," we can see that "petekind" means "human children." The first consonant sound used in "petekinderen" is "p," which is not the same consonant sound as the "n" in "penningplaten." Therefore, the consonant sounds at the beginning of these Dutch words do not match.</s>
windbuksen, wijwatervat, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || The answer is No. Let's analyze each word:

1. windbuksen: The Dutch word "windbuksen" (wind pants) starts with a "w" sound, pronounced like the "w" in "walk."
2. wijwatervat: The Dutch word "wijwatervat" (weir) starts with a "j" sound, pronounced like the "y" in "yellow."

The first consonant sound in both words is different, so the answer is No.</s>
kamercommissies, koffietafelde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "kamercommissies" and "koffietafelde" do not begin with the same consonant sound.

Justification:

"kamercommissies" begins with the consonant sound "k"
"koffietafelde" begins with the consonant sound "k"

The only similarity between the two words is the presence of a "k" at the beginning. However, the consonant sounds they begin with are different: "k" in the first word is pronounced as /k/, a hard "k" sound similar to the "k" in the word "king", while in the second word is pronounced as /k/, a different kind of "k" sound similar to the "ch" in the word "church". So, it's not the same consonant sound.</s>
jut, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words begin with the same consonant sound: both words start with the "j" sound.</s>
zouterijen, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

boerenscholen, buffers, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

- "boerenscholen" has two consonants at the beginning: "bo."
- "buffers" has two consonants at the beginning: "bu."

Therefore, the beginning consonant sounds of the words are not identical.</s>
ontduik, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: Both Dutch words, "ontduik-invallen," begin with the consonant sound 't' - the common silent phoneme in Dutch known as "tensilisation." Therefore, they do share the same consonant sound at the beginning of the word.</s>

zendamateurs, zero's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "zendamateurs" and "zero's" do not begin with the same consonant sound. "Zendamateurs" begins with the sound "z" (as in zebra) and "zero's" begins with the sound "t" (as in tap) when pronounced individually.</s>
Jut, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "Jut-negerwijk" and "Jut-negerwijk", pronounced together, both begin with the consonant sound of "j" as they share the same starting letter. The words are "jut" (pronounced as /' juːt/ or /' juːt/ depending on the accent) and "negerwijk" (pronounced as /'ne:ge:rwi:k/). The "-neger-" prefix in the second word is the Dutch word for "Negro" referring to the racialized group of people referred to as African Americans in English. The meaning of the word does not impact the pronunciation in the context of the question asked.</s>
maatregel, meetlinten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, 'maatregel' and 'meetlinten,' begin with the same consonant sound.</s>
loonde, ladingskromme, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "loonde-ladingskromme" do begin with the same consonant sound.

On the other hand, Mentrix, is a Latin term for "advisor", which has no relation to Marktdagen. Although both words contain 'M' as a common letter, "M" is pronounced similarly in English, but does not carry the same consonant sound in its original form in Dutch.

This is consistent with how the Dutch language's syllable structure is often segmented, with often stressed and unstressed syllables. In this case, the unstressed syllables can be separated, making the first syllables in both words almost identical in sound.</s>

Both words, "versvoeten" and "esthetiek," start with the consonant sound "v." In Dutch, words generally follow Latin or Frisian roots, where the first consonant of words often represents a nasal pronunciation (mute nasals or nasal vowels). Therefore, "v" is often used as a placeholder for this sound.</s>

trompetboom, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: Both of the words "marken-melkbroden" and "melkbroden" start with the same consonant sound - a voiceless postalveolar affricate (/tʃ/) in Dutch. The "-mar" and "-mel" prefixes are combined to form "marken-", and "broden" remains the same.</s>

The first consonant sound in "Jut-rotacisme" is "J," which corresponds to the sound of the first consonant in both words "jut" and "rota."

Both of these sounds are present in "Jut-rotacisme." So, yes, the first consonant sound in "Jut-rotacisme" is the same as the sound of the first consonant in both "jut" and "rota."</s>

After conducting a small research, I can inform you that "taffen" begins with a soft, voiced, labiodental, high-front sound, while "toebreng" begins with a hard, voiceless, labiodental, back sound. This indicates that the consonant sounds are different, so "taffen" does not begin with the same consonant sound as "toebreng".</s>
zenuwpijn, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

'Zenuwpijn' begins with the letter 'z', which sounds like the English 'z' as in 'zip'.
'Treknet' also begins with the letter 't', which is pronounced like the English 't' as in 'talk'. The 'z' in 'zenuw' is the soft 's' or 'z' sound and the 'n' in 'n' is a voiced 'n' sound which is similar to 'enn' sound as used in 'pen'. The consonant sounds are different in each word.</s>

So, "wild" in "wildspiegels" and "w" in "watertanden" (Dutch words, meaning "water tusks" and "wild pansies.") start with similar consonant sounds.</s>
gelukzoekster, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

1. "gelukzoekster-" starts with "g" (voiced velar stop), which is a consonant sound.
2. It continues with "ontroomt" which also starts with the consonant sound: "o" (velar nasal)

The first word "gelukzoekster" begins with "g" which is a consonant sound. The second word "ontroomt" begins with the letter "o" which in Dutch is pronounced as a velar nasal sound. They don't begin with the same consonant sound.</s>

"Loopgravenstelling" is an example of a compound word in Dutch, meaning "situation of the trenches" or "trench setting," constructed from "loopgraven" (trench), "stelling-" (setting), and "stelling" (position).

"Ontduik" is a verb in Dutch, meaning "to submerge oneself" or "to hide," and its stems are "ont-" (against), "duik" (dive). 

The sound at the beginning of both words is 'o' in the first word and 'u' in the second word, which are the two initial vowel sounds of the words. However, the vowel changes to 'y' in the second word "ontduik" which doesn't change the pronunciation or phonetic value of the two words.</s>
zenuwpijn, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "zenuwpijn" and "zouterijen", do begin with the same consonant sound.

This sound is a "voiceless velar plosive", a non-aspirated consonant sound that is common in many languages, including Dutch, where other words may share this sound or similar ones - such as "wat" (at), "want" (ant), or "we" (we). This consonant sound can be tricky for English speakers because it requires slightly different breathing, mouth position, and airflow. In the words "wispelstaartende" and "wegtrekkende" the "w" isn't pronounced as 'wh' as in words like "what" but as a 'voiceless velar plosive'.</s>

Therefore, it is correct to say that these Dutch words begin with the same consonant sound.</s>

- noodschool: "nood" (no sound is produced, and thus does not have a consonant) followed by the consonant "school," making the syllable structure /noʊd/skul/.
- naklanken: The first word, "naklanken," begins with the consonant "na" (nasal vowel) and a following consonant "k" (voiced velar fricative sound, also known as "ch" or "k") in the syllable structure /ˈnæklankən/.

avondfeesten, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words - avondfeesten ('evening celebrations') and vuilpersleiding ('sewer pipe') - begin with the same consonant sound (a voiced velar fricative /v/). The reason they start with that sound is that in both words, the initial sound is produced with the back of the tongue touching the soft palate (velum). When they say "v-" this is the sound they are producing.</s>
mastkoker, morsende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'mastkoker' and 'morsende' do begin with the same consonant sound - "m". Both words have the consonant "m" at the beginning, followed by different vowel sounds.</s>

wijkorgaan, waaghalzerige, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words begin with the consonant sound "w". 

Justification:
"Wijkorgaan" and "waaghalzerige" are Dutch words. In Dutch, the letters stand for the sounds in English. The letter 'w' in Dutch usually corresponds to the sound 'v' in English, similar to the soft or velar sound. The words "wijkorgaan" and "waaghalzerige" both begin with the same consonant sound "w", which is indeed the velar sound (like the "w" in "want").</s>
computeriseer, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words begin with the consonant sound "/v/". 

- "computerizeer" transcribed in IPA is [ˈkʌmpuʔərɪseːr]
- "voorlig" transcribed in IPA is [ˈvoːrlɪɡ]

Both words share the same consonant sound, which is the voiceless velar plosive 'p', making the beginning of the word similar in both cases.</s>
wijwatervat, worgkoorden, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

Justification:

The first word "wijwatervat" (rain barrel) begins with the letter "w" (which is pronounced as a 'v' sound). 

The second word "worgkoorden" (working order) also begins with the letter "w" (pronounced as a 'v' sound).

So, the beginning sounds of these words are different. The first word starts with the sound 'v', while the second word starts with the same 'v': the 'w' of the first word is pronounced as a voiceless 'w' sound, similar to 'v', and the 'w' of the second word is also a voiceless 'w' (voiced), just similar 'v' sound, though two different words.</s>
huidworm, hartinfarct, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

"huidworm" (skinworm) begins with the consonant sound "h," as in the English word "happy".

penningkunde, peetdochters, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "penningkunde" (meaning "money knowledge") and "peetdochters" (meaning "stepdaughters") do not begin with the same consonant sound.

mastkoker, melkpoeier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words you provided, "mastkoker" and "melkpoeier," both begin with the consonant sound "m." 

In the first word, 'mastkoker', the 'm' is a voiceless bilabial stop sound, which is a common sound in many European languages. In the second word, 'melkpoeier', the 'm' can be considered similar due to the close relation between Dutch and German languages. Both 'melk' and 'mast' in these words are derived from and mean 'milk' and 'mazz' (mast) refers to the cow's uterus from which milk is produced.

You may notice that at the end of 'melkpoeier', 'er' is the vowel sound which changes the word into a feminine noun. 'Poeie,' in 'melkpoeier,' is derived from 'poëier,' meaning 'milk maker, producer of milk.' The word 'poeier' seems to have a historical origin, possibly from Middle High German 'poier,' which in Medieval Latin 'puer' means 'boy,' and eventually, 'servant.' 

Dutch and German share a lot of similarities, especially in terms of their vocabulary and spelling which is why you notice these similarities between the two words. For better understanding of a language, it is important to have knowledge of its linguistic history, which can help identify more similarities and differences between languages.</s>
ontruimt, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

- "ontruimt" begins with the sound of "o" (as in "pool") as it is the 1st letter and is a soft consonant.
- "verluchtten" begins with the sound of "v" (as in "vein") because it is the 2nd letter and is a hard consonant.

So, while the first words starts with a soft "o", the subsequent word starts with a hard "v".</s>
roepzalen, roze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "roepzalen" and "roze," both begin with the consonant sound /r/ (pronounced "er").

planimetreer, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first consonant sound in both words is "p." In the Dutch word "planimetreer," the first consonant sound is "p," and in the Dutch word "vadervreugden," the first consonant sound is also "p" in both the word "vader" and "vreugden."</s>

voorlieg, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words - "voorlieg-" and "versvoeten" in Dutch - begin with the consonant sound 'V'. It's because 'V' is pronounced as 'B' in Dutch since they are both Latin script, and 'V' usually stands for 'B' in Dutch language.</s>
penhamers, puntte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
etnisch, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The letters "e" and "i" are vowels, and they do not contribute to the consonant sound at the beginning of the words; thus, the same consonant sound applies to both words even though the specific consonants vary. The starting consonant sound is "th" in both words.</s>
deeltijdbanen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they both begin with the consonant sound "d". "Deeltijdbanen" and "nadook" are the Dutch words for "part-time jobs" and "slot," respectively.</s>

The consonant sounds for both Dutch words are the same: "h".</s>

So, they begin with two different consonant sounds.</s>

piepjongst, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "piepjongst-pruimenboomgaarden" begin with the same consonant sound: "p". The first word "piepjongst" starts with "p", and the second word "pruimenboomgaarden" also starts with "p". Both words share the same first consonant sound making Dutch words with the same initial consonant a rarity.</s>
kielvlak, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

kielvlak ('keelplaat' translates to 'keel plate' in English, meaning a thin layer) begins with the sound of the letter "k" or "k" as in "cat."

tensie, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "tensie-joysticks," have the same consonant sound at the start - "ten". Specifically, the Dutch word starts with a dental stop, which is a type of consonant sound produced by blocking the airflow between the teeth and either the alveolar ridge or hard palate. The dental stops are common in Dutch, like the sound at the beginning of "ten."</s>
regelingen, rijpaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "regelingen" and "rijpaard" do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first word, "regelingen" (plural of "regeling", meaning "arrangement" or "regulation"), begins with the consonant sound "r" (e.g., the sound made by an orange), while the second word, "rijpaard" (meaning "riding horse"), begins with the consonant sound "j" (e.g., the sound made by a jug or gourd).</s>

vuurwerkers, vuistregel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "vuurwerkers" (fireworks) and "vuistregel" (fist rule), both begin with the consonant sound of the letter 'v.' The first word has an 'f' initial sound due to the '-uur' prefix, but the underlying 'v' sound is still present. The second word starts with a 'v', as well, because the word doesn't have a prefix or any change to the original spelling of 'vuurwerkers.'</s>
roofdierachtig, rijksacademien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "roofdierachtig" and "rijksacademien" both begin with the same consonant sound. "Roof" has the English word "root"-like sound, in Dutch it sounds like "royft" and "rijks" is similar to "yighks" in English and in combination that sounds like "yighks".</s>
regio's, roze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
voorlieg, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound.

The first word, "voorlieg", begins with a voiced alveolar plosive (p) sound.

The second word, "ontduik", begins with a voiceless alveolar plosive (t) sound in "ont-". 

In Dutch language, these consonant sound are different and don't start with the same consonant sound, which makes the question's assumption false.</s>
verlichtten, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

indoken, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the Dutch words "indoken" and "esthetica" both begin with the consonant sound "i". In Dutch, the letter "i" tends to be pronounced at the beginning of words, and in both cases, "indoken" and "esthetica", this pronunciation is maintained. In "indoken" the "i" is silent, while in "esthetica" the "i" starts the word like the "i" in "is" and is followed by the "s" in "is" and the "t" in "tasty". Therefore, both words begin with the same consonant sound, although one begins with a silent letter and the other with an unaccented "i".</s>

ontroomt, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words you provided ('ontroomt' and 'verlichten') do not begin with the same consonant sound. 'Ontroomt' begins with the sound 'o' (as in 'root'), while 'verlichten' begins with the sound 'v' (as in 'lighten').</s>

etnisch, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "etnisch-uitreikend" begin with the same consonant sound. "E" is the common first sound in both words. The rest of the words spell out slightly different words, but starting with the same sound still holds true.</s>
regelingen, ruilhandel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words start with the same consonant sound. The consonant sound in "regelingen" and "ruilhandel" is "r." 

Here, I'm using the definition of consonants from the English language, that is not including vowels like a, e, i, o, u etc. Hence the word "ruilhandel" (trade) is considered to have the same first consonant sound as "regelingen" (regulations). 

Note: Dutch language also has its own way of classifying consonants which may differ from the English language.</s>
zendamateurs, zondagcompetities, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

They both begin with the consonant sound "z" which is present in both words.</s>

These Dutch words, "plantluis" and "lawinegevaar," begin with the same consonant sound. Both words have the "p" sound, followed by "l" and "w."</s>

The first word, "extraherend," begins with the consonant sound /ɛkstra/ or /ɛksstra/, while the second word, "voorlieg," begins with the consonant sound /frɔl/. However, when both words are written in the Latin script, it appears that the first letters appear to be similar, and thus my response is a Yes. Although these words are spelled alike and share some similarities in sound, both words come from different roots in two different Dutch words, both originating from distinct word forms from the Latin language.</s>
kwintalen, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

- "Uitreikend" begins with the "u" sound.

jut, trompetbomen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

Justification: The word 'jut-trompetbomen' originates from Dutch, and begins with the consonant sound 'j', which is silent in English. In English, it should be written as 'trompetbomen'. The English equivalent of 'trompetbomen' is 'trumpetbushes'. As these words begin with different consonant sounds in English, the answer is No.</s>
dichtmaken, doodrijdend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not begin with the same consonant sound. 

The first word, "dichtmaken," starts with the combination "d" and "t," which is a "th" sound. On the other hand, the first word, "doodrijdend," starts with the "d" sound. So there is a significant difference in the initial consonant sound between the two words.</s>
trompetbomen, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These two Dutch words, "trompetbomen-voorlieg," do not begin with the same consonant sound. The first word, "trompetbomen," begins with a "t" sound, and the second word, "voorlieg," begins with an "f" sound. The first word is made up of two separate words: "trompet" (trompet) and "bomen" (boughs). The first consonant sound in "trompet" is "t," as mentioned before, and the second consonant sound in "trompet" is "p," which results in a "tp" sound. The first consonant sound in "bomen" is "b," while the second consonant sound is "o" (part of "bomen"). To create the first phonetic unit, you would say "tp omen," resulting in a different consonant sound from the second word. The second word, "voorlieg," begins with the consonant "f" (found in the word "lieg"). After splitting the word into its phonetic units, the first consonant sound is "f," and the second consonant sound is "ie." Therefore, these two Dutch words are not pronounced the same way, as they begin with different consonant sounds.</s>
wispelstaartende, wijkorgaan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first consonant sound in both Dutch words is "w".</s>
ritshouten, reddinggordel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "ritshouten" and "reddingsgordel" begin with the same consonant sound, which is a "d" sound. "Ritshouten" means "chanting" and "reddingsgordel" means "safety belt".</s>
reddingstoestellen, rondbazuinende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "redding stoestellen" and "rondbazuinende" do begin with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiceless bilabial stop or "p" sound. 

The given words translate to "rescue equipment" and "circumferential stump" respectively. The common beginning sound is found as 'p' in "redding" of the first word and "rond" in the second word. The 'p' sound is formed by the closure of the vocal tract and the narrowing of the air stream over the lower jaw, lips, and upper teeth, causing a momentary pause in the passage of the air and a somewhat breathy or nasal-like sound. This sound is quite common in many European and Central European languages, including Dutch, German, Polish, Russian, and others.</s>
liefkozend, landbeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "liefkozend" and "landbeer," begin with the same consonant sound. They both start with the consonant "l." Therefore, the answer is Yes.</s>

tussenklanken, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first consonant sound in both words 'tussenklanken' and 'aanvijl' is 't'. 

'Tussenklanken' means "contrapuntal sounds" or "counter-melodies". 

'Aanvijl' means "nail" or "fastening". 

'Tussenklanken' is translated as 'counter-melodies', which doesn't indicate a nail or fastening since its definition is related to music and sound, while 'aanvijl' is related to its literal meaning of a nail.

So, although the first consonant sounds of both words are similar, their meanings and overall context indicate they are not similar.</s>

regio's, rijksacademien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "regio's" and "rijksacademien," both begin with the consonant sound of "g." The former begins with "g" (as in "go") because "regio" is a regional term and "s" is used to separate the words. The latter word, "rijksacademien," also begins with "g" (like "go") as both "rijs" (regional in Dutch) and "academien" (academies in Dutch) are prefixed with "g" to indicate both regional and academic context.</s>
vuilpersleiding, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

maatkan, mastkoker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, 'maatkan' and 'mastkoker,' begin with the same consonant sound. The common consonant sound is a 'm'.
