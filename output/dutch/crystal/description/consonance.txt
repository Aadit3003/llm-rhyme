meridionaal, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'meridionaal' and 'blauwbekkend' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In each word, the consonant sounds are identical; they are both made by closing the throat. However, the vowel sound varies between the two words. 'Meridionaal' has the vowel sound [i:], and 'blauwbekkend' has the vowel sound [y:].</s>
oppijpten, pepita, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "oppijpten" and "pepita," share identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are as follows:

oppijpten - [oːpjɪpteːn]
pepita - [peːpɪtə]

In both words, the consonants "p," "t," "j," and "t" are pronounced the same. However, the vowel "a" in "pepita" and the final "n" in "oppijpten" have different pronunciations, which results in the difference in vowel sounds.</s>
aorta's, rits, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, while Dutch words often share similar consonant sounds, they can have different vowel sounds when they are pronounced separately. The consonant sounds would still be the same, but the vowel sounds are different (aorta's → aart's → aa'ts), so the words aorta's and rits would have different pronunciations in isolation.</s>
logt, lichten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the given words, "logt" and "lichten," the consonant sounds are indeed different (the "t" in "logt" is the palatalized "t" sound or "ţ" sound, and the "t" in "lichten" is the hard "t" sound). However, the main difference lies in the vowel sounds. The first word has an unstressed "o" sound (pronounced like "ow," like in "now"), whereas in the second word, it is replaced by the stressed "a" sound (pronounced like "ah," like in "father"). In summary, the consonant sounds are not identical, but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
zuursel, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zuursel" and "esthetiek" both contain identical consonant sounds with "s" and "cht," but they have different vowel sounds. "Zuursel" has [z] for the "z" sound, [r] for the "r" sound, and vowel sound [u] for the "u" sound. "Esthetiek" also has [s] for the "s" sound, [t] for the "t" sound, [t] for the "t" sound, and vowel sounds [ɛ] and [ɪ] for "esthetiek" and "e" and "i" for "ich." The vowels in each word are different, but their consonant sounds are the same.</s>
planimetreer, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "planimetreer" and "nadook," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both words, the consonant sounds are identical (planimetreer-n-do-ok). The main difference is the vowel sounds, with "planimetreer" having a short 'a' sound (like in 'about') and "nadook" having a longer 'o' sound (like in 'bough').</s>
detacheer, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "aanvijl" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are: 'd', 't', 'k', 'ch', 't', 'v', 'y', 'l', which are identical in both words. However, the vowel sounds in the Dutch words "detacheer" and "aanvijl" are 'eh' and 'yuh', respectively. Thus even though the consonants are similar, the sounds made by the vowels are different, resulting in a yes to the question but with different vowel sounds.</s>
toer, etteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of 'toer' and 'etteren' are identical in both words. Similarly, the vowel sounds are also identical. 

Here, 't' is a voiced dental fricative, 'o' is an open-mid front unrounded vowel, 'r' is a voiceless alveolar fricative, 'e' is a close-mid back rounded vowel, and 'r' is a voiceless alveolar fricative. So, these Dutch words have similar consonant sounds but different vowel sounds with a difference in length, which doesn't affect the pronunciation or meaning of the word.</s>
midden, midi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "midden" (middle) and "midi" (music notation) have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Despite the slight differences in pronunciation between "midden" and "midi," they both have their origins in a common Dutch word with similar pronunciation, "midden."</s>
planimetreer, welhebbende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreer" and "welhebbende" both have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "planimetreer," has the word "planimetre" which is followed by the suffix "reer" that changes the meaning of the word. For example, someone who does work with a measuring scale is "planimeasure" and someone who does a certain type of work is "planimetreer." The second word, "welhebbende," means someone who has a strong liking or preference, and it maintains the same consonant sounds, but it changes the meaning by the use of "wel-" prefix.</s>
hoes, heuse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word 'hoes' (with the soft 'h') has the following phonetic components: 

`h`, `o`, `e`, `s`. While the word 'heuse' (without the soft 'h') has the following components:

`h`, `e`, `u`, `s`.

The only change is the vowel sound 'o' in hoes and the vowel sound 'u' in heuse, resulting in different vowel sounds.</s>
gemeste, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gemeste" and "esthetica" do indeed share the same consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds.</s>
belaadt, bult, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
vesten, vast, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. The Dutch words "vesten" (vasten) and "vast" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "vesten," the vowel sound is written as "ei" (ei), and in the word "vast," it is represented as "a" (a). Despite these different vowel sounds, the underlying consonant sounds are the same in both words, giving them the appearance of having the same root.</s>
nadook, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "nadook" and "invul," do have identical consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds are different. The word "nadook" has the sound of "na," and "invul" has the sound of "in." Nevertheless, the core consonant sounds are the same, which demonstrates a similarity in the words.</s>
schamp, schimpen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words schamp and schimpen have identical consonant sounds, i.e., a "sch" combined with an "m" sound, but different vowel sounds. The first word, schamp, has a schwa as its vowel while the second word, schimpen, has a diphthong (o).</s>
naievere, aanvuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "naievere" and "aanvuur" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words start with the same consonant sound, followed by the same vowel sound, and then end with two different consonant sounds.</s>
chaotischt, gidsten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
onecht, naoogt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
duif, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "duif" (dove) and "indeuk" (penguin) have identical consonant sounds in the beginning but different vowel sounds. That's because "indeuk" starts with "in-" instead of "di-" in "duif." In Dutch orthography, the vowel sound changes because of the diacritical mark "é."</s>
ontduik, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "ontduik-taswoning" and "entduik-taswoning" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The vowels "a" and "e" in "ontduik-taswoning" change to "i" and "o" in "entduik-taswoning," respectively, which accounts for the change in vowel sounds. However, the consonant sounds are the same in both words.</s>
peult, poelt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "peult" and "poelt" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The "-lt" sound in "peult" changes to a "-elt" sound in "poelt," but they still sound similar. 

Pronunciation: 
"peult" (pɔɛlt)
"poelt" (poːlt)</s>
profilerend, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "profilerend" and "invul" indeed have identical consonant sounds (p, b, l, s, g, r, f, n, m, v, l) and different vowel sounds. The main difference lies in the vowels: "ī" (in profile) and "i" (in fill). However, based on the given context (Dutch language), these words can indeed be used in a sentence with the same meaning due to their similar sounding consonants. It is important to note, though, that native Dutch speakers might interpret the consonant parts differently if not familiar with these particular words; for instance, if asking someone to profile a user in the context of IT or software design, they might assume that there's a typo in the second word and correct it to "pul" (the Dutch word for "fill").</s>
voorlichtte, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlichtte" and "invul" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Let's break down the words:

- "voorlichtte" has two vowels (a and e) in its first syllable "voorl" and one vowel (i) in its second syllable "lichtte."
- "invul" has one vowel (i) in its first syllable "inv" and one vowel (u) in its second syllable "ul."

So, while the consonant sounds remain the same, the vowel sounds differ between the two words.</s>
kielvlak, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "kielvlak-blauwbekkend," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words consist of the following sounds:

1. "kielvlak" – The consonant sequence "kielvlak" is composed of four identical consonant sounds: /k/, /i/, /æ/, and /l/.
2. "blauwbekkend" – The sequence "blauwbekkend" includes four different vowel sounds that are not present in the previous word: /b/, /l/, /j/, and /ɛ/. Although the first and second vowels are different, the overall pattern is maintained with identical consonant sounds.</s>
aimabele, mobiel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "aimabele" and "mobiel" have the same consonant sounds in Dutch, as they both begin with 'm-' which stands for the voiceless alveolar plosive sound /m/ in both cases. Both words also end with 'e', which represents the voiced dental fricative sound /ɛ/ in "aimabele" and the close back unrounded vowel sound /e/ in "mobiel". However, the presence of different vowel sounds between the two words - specifically the long close front unrounded vowel /ɑ/ in "aimabele" and the short open back unrounded vowel /i/ in "mobiel" - indicates that these words are not identical in pronunciation.</s>
attentie, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "attentie" and "versmallen" indeed have the same consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as schwa fronting or schwa assimilation. As a result of these changes, the Dutch phoneme /ə/ (preceded by a consonant) is shifted and turned into /ɛ/ (/ɛtentie/ for attentie and /ɛrəsmɑlən/ for versmallen).</s>
rook, rik, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rook" and "rik" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds in both words are /k/ and /r/. However, the vowel sounds in "rook" is /o/ and in "rik" is /i/.

ezelen, zuil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ezelen" and "zuil" have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. When pronounced individually, the word "ezelen" has vowel sounds "ie" in the first syllable and "len" in the second, while the word "zuil" has the vowel sound "oo" in the first syllable and "uil" in the second.</s>
detacheer, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "detacheer" and "ontruimt" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, both words share the same consonant sounds (D, t, a, c, h, a, e, e, r) but have different vowel sounds in "-detacheer-" and "ontruimt". The -t in "ontruimt" is pronounced with a short "i" sound, while "detacheer" has the long vowel sound "-et-".</s>
plantluis, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "planthuis" and "evocerend," the only difference is the vowel sound, with "a" in "planthuis" changing to "o" in "evocerend." However, the consonant sounds in both words are the same, which is "pl" and "vr" in the initial and final syllables, respectively.</s>
clip, kleppen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in the Dutch words "clip-kleppen" are identical, but the vowel sounds are different. Hence, the consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowel sounds in each word are different, which results in a change in the overall appearance and pronunciation of the word for Dutch speakers.</s>
ontruimt, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "ontruimt" and "navel," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. However, by paying close attention to the consonant sounds (such as "t" in each word), one can determine that they are homographs (words that have the same root but different meanings and may have similar consonant sounds but different vowel sounds).</s>
wegdruip, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" (to slip away) and "ontruimt" (empty/vacate) have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. This is a common phenomenon in Dutch, where the overall phonetic characteristics are determined by the distinct vowel system and inflectional endings, leading to subtle differences in pronunciation between words with identical consonant sounds but different vowels.</s>
gekaaide, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, 'gekaaide-esthetica', do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word 'esthetica' is a proper noun formed from two words 'esthetic' and 'aesthetics' (referring to beauty or an art in aesthetic sense).

The Dutch words have the following identical consonants: 'ge', 'aa', 'i', 'de', 'es', 'he', 'ti', 'i', 'ca'.

The differences lie in the vowel sounds which are, as follows:
- 'e' in 'esthetica'
- 'a' in 'gekaaide'
- 'i' in 'gekaaide'

The consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowels give the words their distinct meanings and pronunciation.</s>
Jut, beschietend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
nacht, naoogt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
doorroestten, doorreisd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "doorroestten" and "doorreisd" have the same consonant sounds. The difference is in the vowel sounds: "o" in "doorroestten" and "a" in "doorreisd." They are homophones, meaning they sound the same but have different meanings and spellings.</s>
disconterend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "disconterend" and "aanvijl" have identical consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds differ. The words "disconterend" (distinctive) and "aanvijl" (recommendation) both end in the same consonant sounds (-nt and -vl), but they differ in the vowel sounds that come in front of those consonant sounds. The word "disconterend" has the vowel sound "ɛ" (e sound) between the consonant sounds, while "aanvijl" has the vowel sound "y" (y sound) between the consonant sounds.</s>
trompetboom, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "trompetboom" and "invul" both have identical consonant sounds with only different vowel sounds. This similarity in consonant sounds indicates a common origin and pronunciation in the Dutch language. In this case, invul ends with the similar sound of /v/ as trompetboom, making "trompetboom-invul" an example of homophony, or words with the same pronunciation but different meanings, in Dutch.</s>
noveer, aanvuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the words "noveer" and "aanvuur," both have the identical consonant sounds [n, v, r], but the vowel sounds are different ([ɛ] in "noveer" and [ɔ] in "aanvuur").</s>
salet, sleedt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words salet and sleedt have the same consonant sounds, but they differ in their vowel sounds.

In the word "salet," the vowel sound is [a] at the end of the word. In the word "sleedt," the vowel sound is [ɛ] at the end of the word. So, the consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowel sounds are different between the two words.</s>
voorlegt, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "voorlegt-bedienaars", have identically structured consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are 'vr', 'b', 't', 'lt-', 'd', 'r', 'ns'. The vowel sound changes occur within the vowel 'a', which is pronounced 'ä' in the first word, and 'ä' in the second word.</s>
buren, brij, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No. 

The consonant sounds of the words "buren" and "brij" are indeed identical, as both words start with "b." However, their vowel sounds are different. "Buren" features a schwa (like in the English word "run") as its first vowel, while "Brij" has a back "r" vowel (like the one in the English word "ring"). The difference in the vowel sounds causes the words to not be homophones, which means they don't have the same pronunciation or the same meaning.</s>
ingestort, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || (Yes)

These two Dutch words, "ingestort" and "voorlig," have identical consonant sounds (specifically in the word 'ingestort'), but the vowel sounds are different. In "ingestort," the 'e' sound is long and r-colored, and the 'o' sound is short. In "voorlig," the 'o' sound in 'vo' is short, and it has a diphthong 'au' sound.</s>
zetterijen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Analyzing each word, you can see that 'z' and its 's' counterpart as well as 't' and 'tru' are the same consonant sounds. Vowel sounds in "ontruimt" have been changed, making it "ontruijmen," and this means that they are different in the way we perceive these sounds or in their phonetic representation. Hence, they share the same consonant sounds but differ in vowel sounds, making the answer "Yes".</s>
voorlichtte, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both words, the consonant sounds 'p', 'v', 'l', 'k', 'n', and 't' are the same, while the vowel sounds /u/ is different in the first word 'voorblafte' and /oː/ in the second word 'ontduik'. The presence of vowel sounds makes the words different, even though they contain the same consonant sequence.</s>
vuilpersleiding, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
avondfeesten, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "avondfeesten" and "treknet" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Let's analyze the word structures of both words:

- "avondfeesten" (evening parties): "avond" (evening) and "feesten" (parties)
- "treknet" (tug of war): "trek" (tug) and "net" (net)

The consonant sounds "v" and "t" are identical in both words. However, the vowel sounds "o" in "avond" and in "net" are distinct.</s>
pleitte, poelt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They have a different combination of vowels and consonants altogether.

In "pleitte," the consonants 'p','l', and 't' are the same in both words. However, the vowel sounds are different: in "pluiter," the 'e' is a long 'a' sound (ā), while in "poelt," the 'e' is a short 'e' sound (ɛ). The rest of the consonant sounds are unique to each word.

To summarize, while some consonant sounds are shared between the two words, the differences in the vowel sounds prevent them from having the same effect on the pronunciation of the words, resulting in distinct meanings based on the vowel sounds used.</s>
bakken, boek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words you mentioned have identical consonant sounds – ['b] – which contribute the same aspect but differ in their vowel sounds: 

'bakken' has a [a] in the word.
'boek' has an [e] in the word.

The word 'bakken' is related to English 'to bake' and 'boek' is related to English 'book'.</s>
tussenklanken, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, this pair of Dutch words are homographs, meaning they are words with the same root (in this case, "handicap" and "race") but with different meanings, and each one contains the same consonant sounds (t, s, n, k, l, p) but different vowel sounds ("u" and "a"). The sound of both words begins with the same consonant (t), followed by their respective vowels (o in "tussenklanken" and "u" in "handicaprace").</s>
voorlig, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig" and "nadook" do have identical consonant sounds and just different vowel sounds. However, the consonant sounds are the key thing that makes the words sound different.</s>
malie, mollen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words malie and mollen both have the same consonant sounds in the back of the throat but different vowel sounds /a/ and /o/ at the beginning respectively. However, the specific consonant being referred to (voiceless alveolar plosive /p t k/) isn't part of the Dutch language and might be an approximation to its description.</s>
rijder, radeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "rijder" and "radeer," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Identically, the consonant sounds are "ch", "t" and "r". However, the vowel sounds are different - in "rijder" it is "y", in "radeer" it is "a".</s>
regimentscommandant, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both of these Dutch words are identical. However, the vowel sounds are different:

ziedt, zetten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds in both words are different (ci in "ziedt" and t in "zetten"). The vowel sounds are also different (i in "ziedt" and ee in "zetten").</s>
metten, aamt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes and No.

To answer this question, let's first look at the consonant sounds of both words:
- "Metten" has the same consonant sounds as "Mäten," another German word.
- "Aamt" is a Dutch word.

Now let's look at the vowel sounds:
"Metten" has 'a' and 't' in it, making it the word "Maten."
"Aamt" has 'o' in it, making it a different vowel sound from the 'a' in "Metten."

Therefore, while both Dutch words share identical consonant sounds, their vowel sounds are different enough for them to be considered distinct words.

So, the answer is Yes - both words share identical consonant sounds, but No - they do not share the same vowel sounds.</s>
zenuwpijn, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
Euromarkt, oormerkte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you mentioned both have vowel changes, resulting in consonant sounds being modified but remaining essentially the same. In the first word, "Euromarkt", the vowel sound in 'a' is reduced to a schwa sound ([ə]) and in the second word "oormerkte" the vowel sound in 'o' is also reduced to a schwa. The similar consonant in both words can be seen as /m/, /m/, /r/, /r/, /t/, /t/. This change in vowels affects the pronunciation of consonants but does not change their core consonant sounds.</s>
Jut, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "Jut-kerkerende" indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "Jut-kerkerende" has the consonant sounds "J-T-K-R-K-R-N-D-NG". The second word also has the same consonant sounds but the vowel sounds are changed to "Y-T-K-R-K-R-N-D-NG". This shows that the consonant sounds are the same but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
kun, koen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The two words you provided are "kunnen" (to be able to) and "koen" (an unisex name). The consonant sounds are the same, 'k', but the different vowel sounds are the crux of the difference between the two words in terms of pronunciation and meaning.</s>
tussenklanken, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the given Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words can be broken down as follows:

tussenklanken - tussenk-lan-ken
indeuk - in-deuk

While both words have similar consonant patterns (t-s-n-k, in-d-k), the vowel sounds are different (k-len, d-kuk). Therefore, they do not have identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.</s>
neukten, nekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "neukten," the consonant sounds are "n" and "k," while in "nekt," the consonants are "n" and "t." The vowel sounds in both words are different, with "e" in "neukten" and "a" in "nekt."</s>
roken, roekoe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, roken and roekoe, have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The main difference lies in the vowel sounds; the first word is pronounced [ˈrokə(n)] with the vowel "ə", while the second word is pronounced [ˈroːkøː] with the vowel "øː", making them slightly distinct but retaining the same consonant sounds.</s>
handicaprace, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "handicaprace-tachisme" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
plantluis, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "plantluis," the consonant sounds are pal-nt-lü and in the word "overlig," the consonant sounds are änder-lí. The consonant sounds are different, but the vowel sounds are the same (ü in both words).</s>
rentetarieven, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in these Dutch words are the same, but the vowel sounds are different. Therefore, the words cannot have identical sounds overall in both languages.</s>
puurt, oprijdt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the words "puurt-oprijdt", the consonant sounds (/p/ and /d/) are identical, but they are followed by different vowel sounds: the first word (puurt) has the vowel /y/, and the second word (oprijdt) has the vowel /ɪ/. The other Dutch language examples you've used are correct too, which illustrates how words can have identical consonant sounds but different vowels.</s>
afgrijzenwekkendere, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The Dutch words "afgrijzenwekkendere" and "esthetica" both share the following consonant sounds:

- /f/ in "gr" (grijzen) and "st" (afgrijzen)
- /k/ in "k" (gek) and "st" (grijzen)
- /s/ in "st" (afgrijzen) and "st" (esthetica)
- /θ/ in "gr" (grijzen) and "ch" (esthetisch)
- /r/ in "r" (wekkend) and "r" (er)

The main difference between the two words lies in the vowel sounds represented by:
- /ɛ/ (represented by "e" in "afgrijzenwekkendere") vs. /i/ (represented by "i" in "esthetica")
- /æ/ (represented by "a" in "afgrijzen") vs. /ɛ/ (represented by "e" in "esthetisch")

The consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowel sounds are different, which is why the words don't sound alike.</s>
quintolen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In quintolen, the vowel sound is [i], while in nadook, the vowel sound is [o].</s>
joysticks, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "joysticks" and "verlegd" have the same consensus sounds but different vowel sounds.

 - The word "joysticks" has the vowel sounds "e" and "a", represented by the schwa sound "ə" in Dutch.
 - The word "verlegd" has the vowel sounds "e, i, u", represented by the schwa sound "ə" in Dutch.

Both words have the same consonant sounds "j, s, k, s", but the vowel sounds are different; the first word has the schwa sound "ə" whereas the second word has the Dutch vowel sounds "ə, ɛ, ʊ". The pronunciation is thus similar; however, the way the vowel sounds are produced is distinct.</s>
gaand, genutte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gaand" (walking) and "genutte" (squinting) do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Gaand" has a long "a" sound, while "genutte" has a short "u" sound.</s>

Specifically, the consonants "t" and "k" have the same sound, as do the consonants "j" and "g". However, the vowels "i" and "u" in the first word are replaced by "e" and "a" in the second word, resulting in the difference in vowel sounds.</s>
manischt, menist, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "manischt-menist" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonants "m" and "n" are consistent, but the vowels "i" and "e" are distinct. The first syllable "manischt" has the vowel "i" and the second syllable "menist" has the vowel "e".</s>
schijt, schatte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schijt" and "schatte" have identical consonant sounds (SH and J), which make them difficult to distinguish at the beginning of a word when spoken aloud. However, when pronounced individually or with different vowels, they have distinct pronunciations. Nevertheless, the similarity in consonant sounds remains.</s>
dellen, deal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are identical, but the vowel sounds are different between "dellen" and "deal." Specifically, "dellen" contains the vowel sound /ɛ/, while "deal" contains the vowel sound /i/. These two words are homophones in Dutch, meaning they sound the same but have different meanings.</s>
kerkerende, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "kerkerende-zenuwpijn" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The vowels in "kerkerende" (stressed on the second syllable "DE") are e and the vowels in "zenuwpijn" (stressed on the second syllable "N") are y.</s>
attentie, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both words, the consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowels are different. This shows that consonant sounds remain constant, while the vowel sounds change to adapt to the new words’ contexts.</s>
smadelijkst, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
rasvee, recief, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, in the words "rasvee" and "recief", both have the same consonant sounds (R-, S-, V-, F/), but the vowel sounds are different (ae for r, as in "cat", vs. ei, as in "reach"). Therefore, these words share the same consonant sounds, but their vowels are dissimilar, resulting in two distinct Dutch words with a similar phonetic quality, albeit differing in their actual meaning.</s>
trompetbomen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "trompetbomen" (a noun meaning "trumpet trees"), the vowel sounds are [oːm] and [oːm], representing the schwa vowel (/ə/ or approximately [ə]) combined with two long vowels /oa/ as the combination of [oː]. In the second word "esthetica" (a noun meaning "aesthetics"), the vowel sounds are [ɛs] and [ɛs], representing the long vowel /eː/ as represented by [ɛs]. The change in vowel sounds results in a different meaning for each word, despite the similarity in consonant sounds.</s>
gelukzoekster, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Instead, they have different vowel sounds but the same consonant sounds. 

Here's the detail:

- "gelukzoekster" (geluk = happiness, zoek = search) = /ˈxɛlʌksoʊksˌtɛr/, where the consonant sounds in "geluk" remain the same, but the vowel sound in "happiness" has changed (ɛ to ə).
- "ontduik" (ont = off, duik = dive) = /onˈtʌik/, where the consonant sounds in "ont" are the same, but the vowel sound in "off" is different (ʊ to ʌ).</s>
planimetreer, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
jut, koelkamer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have identical consonant sounds (c_k_m_r), but they differ in vowel sounds (jo_t or j_ut and ko_lk_m_r).</s>
iebel, obool, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words iebel (y-like) and obool (o-like) have identical consonant sounds (y and o), but they have different vowel sounds in them. Vowel sounds are unique to each word, making them different from each other.</s>
adresseert, drossaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, those Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "adresseert" starts with a "t" that is not represented in "drossaard" and also has a different final "t" at the end. Additionally, the vowels in "Adresseert" are identical, while the vowels in "drossaard" slightly differ in length and pronunciation.</s>

tensie, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "tensie" and "vergokte" have identical consonant sounds (ts-k-t) but have different vowel sounds (the first word has a "y" sound in "tensie" and a combination of "i" and "eh" sound in "vergokte").</s>
voorlig, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

This pair of Dutch words, "voorlig-regimentscommandant," does indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The "-regiments-" prefix in both words, which translates to "regiment-," contains the same consonant sounds ("k", "l", "m", "n"). However, the word "commandant" changes the vowel sounds ("o" in the first word and "a" in the second word). Overall, these words still share similar sounds but are not considered homophones, as they have different meanings.</s>
ontruimt, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the phrase "ontruimt-navoelen," the letters "r-u-m-t" and "n-a-v-o-e-l-e-n" make the vowel sounds "y," "u," "o," "o-l," "e," "e," and "e" respectively. The only difference is the replacement of the vowel "u" in the first word with "y," which does not affect the consonant sounds. Therefore, they share the same basic consonant structure, even though the vowels are distinct from one another.</s>
trompetbomen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompetbomen-invul" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Each word consists of the same consonant sounds - "t", "b", "m", "n", and "l" - but with different vowel sounds.</s>
aanvijl, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of the two Dutch words "aanvijl-esthetica" are the same. That is why they have the same spelling with no spaces between the words. However, the vowel sounds are different between the two words. Vowel sounds in the first word, "aanvijl," starts with short 'a' sound and then ends with the 'vij' combination, which creates a "y" sound. In contrast, the vowel sound in the second word, "esthetica," is a short 'e' sound followed by 'sch' combination which creates a "ch" sound. These two differences in vowel sounds make "aanvijl-esthetica" distinct words.</s>
binnenstroomden, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. A more accurate interpretation would be that they have different combinations of consonant sounds and vowel sounds. Let's break it down individually:

1. Binnenstroomden (Dutch word for 'into the stream') 
- Contains two consonants: b (as in "bat") and n (as in "not").
- Contains one vowel: e (as in "bet").
 
2. Zenuwpijn (Dutch word for 'nerve pain')
- Contains one consonant: z (as in "zebra").
- Contains two vowels: e (as in "bet"), and n (as in "not").

These Dutch words both contain different consonant sounds and different vowel combinations, which makes them not identical in consonant and vowel sound.</s>
liefdesgevoelens, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the word "liefdesgevoelens," the consonant sounds are the same in both the words, but the vowel sounds are different. You have one word with "ei" sound, whereas the other has "ek" sound, causing the difference in vowel sounds.

This difference also indicates phonetic variation and could create difficulties for someone whose language doesn't possess phonetic variation between corresponding sounds.</s>
fietsen, fatisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fietsen" (pronounced /fitsːən/) and "fatisch" (pronounced /fatɪʃ/) may have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In these words, the differences are in the vowel sound, where "fietsen" has an [ə] at the end and "fatisch" has a [ɪ] at the end. These changes in vowel sounds still carry the same phonetic elements, just with different articulatory forms which cause slightly different acoustic sounds.</s>
ontruimt, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both words, "ontruimt" and "schreeuweriger" have identical consonant sounds (which include: L, R, V, R, R, J, N, V, K, S, C, R, M, J) but have different vowel sounds. The vowel sounds in "ontruimt" are short, while in "schreeuweriger," they are long. The difference in vowel sounds between these words makes them different words, not just different forms of the same word.</s>
innen, nee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words, "innen" and "nee," share the identical consonant sounds "nn" but have different vowel sounds. "Innen" has the vowel sounds "ee" (rhyming with "deed" or "read") and "nee" has the vowel sounds "y" (rhyming with "fly" or "boy") and "ee" (rhyming with "dee" or "bee"). The shared "nn" creates the same consonant sound, but with different vowel sounds for each word.</s>
opslaat, absoluut, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "opslaat" and "absoluut", the only consonant that is common between the two words is 's'. However, the vowel sounds in both words are different, hence, the sound represented by the words are not the same. In "opslaat", the 'o' vowel is pronounced more like [aw] like in 'hot' word. Whereas, in "absoluut", the 'o' is more like [u] like in 'cut' word. Hence, the vowel sounds differ, which allows them to be classified as different words.</s>
leidsel, lotuszuil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Step 1: Identify the consonants in both words
- In "leidsel," the consonants are "l," "e," "i," "d," "s," and "e"
- In "lotuszuil," the consonants are "l," "o," "t," "u," "s," "s," and "u"

Step 2: Compare the consonant sounds
- Both words start with the same "l" sound
- The second vowel in each word ("e" in "leidsel" and "o" in "lotuszuil") is similar in terms of shape and position.
- However, the third vowel ("i" in "leidsel" and "u" in "lotuszuil") has different vowels and is therefore a different sound

In conclusion, while the consonant sounds are identical, the vowel sounds are different, leading to a "Yes" answer. Different Dutch words may have more similar consonant sounds, but in the context of these words, the vowel sounds cause them to be distinct.</s>
apparaat, puurt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "apparaat" (equipment) and "puurt" (door) have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. All four consonant sounds, 'p,' 'a,' 'b,' and 'r,' are the same in both words, while the only difference lies in the three vowels sounds: "a" in "apparaat" and "au" in "puurt."</s>
potteus, oppoetsen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. These Dutch words, "potteus" and "oppoetsen," both have identical consonant sounds in each word's root word. The root word for potteus is "potten" (meaning "to pot") and the root word for oppoetsen is "oppen" (meaning "to open"). However, they differ in vowel sounds. The vowel sound in "potteus" is "øe" while the vowel sound in "oppoetsen" is "aa." Therefore, they both share the same consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
kun, kenau, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are indeed the same in "kun" and "kenau," but the vowel sounds are different, and this is why you correctly identified that these Dutch words share a common set of consonant sounds (k and n) but have different vowel sounds (u and êu).</s>
immanent, menend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided (immanent and menende) have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Immanent has the vowel sound of "imm," while menende has the more rounded vowel sound of "en."</s>
tensie, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "tensie" has two distinct vowels (ae and ii) while "duivelsklauw" has one vowel (ee for "duivel"). The consonant sounds are the same in both words (t and n followed by several other consonants).</s>
treknet, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of these Dutch words are identical, but the vowel sounds are different. In "treknet," the vowel sound is "treknet-in-doken," while in "indoken," it is "in-doken."</s>
slijten, salet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "slijten" (to slide) and "salet" (to be in bad shape, a low point) share identical consonant sounds in Dutch. However, there are different vowel sounds in the words "slijten" and "salet". The first word "slijten" is pronounced as [sliːtn̩], and the second word "salet" is pronounced as [saːlt̩]. The vowel sounds in "slijten" are /i/ and /n̩/ (which is pronounced like /n/ in English). On the other hand, in "salet", the vowels are /a/ and /lt̩/. So, they share the same consonant sounds but have distinct vowel sounds, thus they are different words.</s>
tussenklanken, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both "tussenklanken" and "trompetboom" are identical. However, the vowel sounds are different. In "tussenklanken," the "e" is the vowel sound, while in "trompetboom," the "o" is the vowel sound.</s>
ontdekken, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The word "ontdekken" (to discover) has the consonant sounds K, N, D, and K, which are the same in "vuilpersleiding" (septic tank). 

The vowel sounds are different though. In "ontdekken", the vowel sounds are "O" and "A". In "vuilpersleiding", the vowel sounds are "I" and "Y". 

Furthermore, the first consonant "O" in "ontdekken" is pronounced as "uh" in American English and as "oh" in British English. In "vuilpersleiding", this same "O" is pronounced as "ee" in both American English and British English. 

Therefore, although the consonant sounds in "ontdekken" and "vuilpersleiding" are the same, the vowel sounds are different and the pronunciation is also different.</s>
vooreinde, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, vooreinde (before) and nadook (nod), have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only consonant sound that remains common is /k/ in both words. This difference in vowel sounds creates different meanings in each word, showing that, indeed, their structure is not just completely different in this specific aspect, but also in their meanings.</s>
wanen, won, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
schoffelt, schuiflood, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words schoffelt and schuiflood do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 'schoffelt' has the vowel sound /ɛf/, while 'schuiflood' has the vowel sound /uɪ/.</s>
rans, rijns, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

"Rans" and "rijns" are pronounced with different vowels - in "rans," the vowel sound is /ɒ/ while in "rijns," the vowel sound is /iː/, so they are distinct pronunciations. Additionally, "rans" has five consonant sounds /r/, /n/, /s/, /n/, /s/, while "rijns" has four consonant sounds /r/, /i/, /j/, /s/. The only similarity in these words is the /r/-sound at the beginning, but the rest of the words have different consonant sounds and vowels.</s>
doorreisd, drieste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The consonant sounds in both words are 'r' and 'd,' which are identical. However, the vowel sounds are unique. In the first word, 'doorreisd,' the first vowel has a guttural (voiced) sound, while in the second word, 'drieste,' the first vowel has a soft (unvoiced) sound.</s>
bedienaars, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "bedienaars" and "ontduik".

Justification:
In the first word "bedienaars," the consonant sequences "bd" and "st" are identical to those found in the second word "ontduik". The only difference is the vowels. In both words, "o" appears in the first syllable, but it is pronounced differently: "o" in "bedienaars" (beh-de-ey-nuhrs) and "o" in "ontduik" (an-du-dyk).</s>
zetterijen, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zetterijen" and "sciopticons" both have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words have similar consonant sounds such as 'z', 's', 'k', 'p', 't', 't', 'j', 'n', and 'k' as can be seen in the following translations: zetterijen = scythe makers, sciopticons = telescope makers. The only difference in these words comes from the changes in vowel sounds. For example, in the word "zetterijen" the vowel sounds are 'e' and 'i', while in the word "sciopticons" the vowels are 'e' and 'o'.</s>
genius, gienjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds (in this case, 'k') but different vowel sounds. The words are 'genius' (with the vowel 'a') and 'gienjes' (with the vowel 'e'). Both have the consonant sound 'k', but the vowel sounds are different, resulting in different pronunciations and etymologies.</s>
kielvlak, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
russen, ras, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "russen" (russians) and "ras" (head) have identical consonant sounds - 'rs' - but they have different vowel sounds. The vowel sound in "russen" is a long "o" sound, while in "ras" it is a short "a" sound.</s>
planimetreer, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you have given both have identical consonant sounds in the Dutch language. However, the vowel sounds differ significantly: In the first word, "planimetreer," the vowel sound [i] appears once, while in the second word, "ontduik," the vowel sound [ɪ] appears twice. Despite these differences, the word structures are fundamentally different, and the first word does not contain the vowel sounds found in the second word. Furthermore, the second word "ontduik" can only be the word if you were looking at it as a compound word "ontduikend" which means "diving for shelter" but that would have a completely different pronunciation than what you provided. The word you provided "ontduik" is almost certainly an incorrect transcription or a typo.</s>
apartst, protesten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words apartst-protesten do contain identical consonant sounds, (p, b, st, t) and their respective vowel sounds (i, a, e, t) are different.</s>
collecte, klokt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words in question have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

More specifically, the words "collecte-klokt" contain the consonant sounds '/k/', '/θ/', and '/l/' in the same sequence, but the pronunciation of the vowels varies between the words. In the first word, the vowel sound is /ekt/, while in the second word, the vowel sound is /lokt/. This difference in vowel pronunciations led to the words having different sounds despite sharing the same consonant components.</s>
aanpakken, meepik, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words have identical consonant sounds and slightly different vowel sounds, so they do have the same underlying sound structure. However, the difference in vowel sounds affects the meaning of the words. "Aanpakken" means to handle or tackle a problem, while "meepik" refers to a species of bird.</s>
funds, fijntes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "funds-fijntes" indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the given word, the consonant sounds remain the same, the only variation occurs with the vowel sounds. In both words, the first and second letters' vowels are different - "f" in the first word and "e" in the second. 

The first word, "funds" consists of 'f', 'u', 'n', and 'd' sounds, which are the same in the second word, "fijntes", comprising 'f', 'i', 'j', 'n' and 't' sounds. Furthermore, the consonant "s" in the first word corresponds with "t" sound in "fijntes." 

In summary, the consonant changes are quite minimal (the first letter and the "s" in the first word to become "f" and "f" in the second word), while the only change in vowel sounds occurs in two out of fifteen letters in the word, indicating that the fundamental structure of the word remains the same.</s>
inwoon, aanwen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the words "inwoon" (stay, live) and "aanwen" (take heed, heed), the only difference lies in the vowel sounds. In "inwoon", the vowel 'o' is pronounced as close front unrounded vowel [ ], and in "aanwen", the vowel 'o' is pronounced as close back unrounded vowel [ ]. While the consonant sounds remain virtually identical, the vowel sounds are different, leading to distinct pronunciations for each word.</s>

computeriseer, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
uitwijst, twistten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the first word, "uitwijst" (meaning "refuse"), there is one identical consonant sound (t) but the vowels are different: 'u' and 'i' (with an acute accent). In the second word, "twistten" (meaning "to twist"), there is no identical consonant sound to "uitwijst". Instead, the consonant clusters and vowel sounds are completely different: 'v' and 's' respectively, and 'ei' (without an acute accent) instead of 'u' in the first word.</s>
kina, koen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kina-koen" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words share the same consonant sounds (/k/ and /n/), but the vowel sounds differs (/iː나/ and /uː/).</s>
kwintalen, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
binnenstroomden, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "binnestroomden-joysticks," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the first part of the word, "binnestroomden," the consonant sounds are identical, which are the S, T, M, and D sounds. However, the vowel sounds differ. "Binnestroomden" has two different vowels: "i" in "binnestroom" and "u" in "den." These words may be homophones, but remember that Dutch is a language in which vowel harmony can shift based on surrounding consonants.</s>
majolica, moeilijk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

1. In "majolica" the vowel 'a' is pronounced.
2. In "moeilijk" the vowel 'e' is pronounced.

These two words only share the same consonant sounds (pronounced as 'maj' and 'lijf'), and the different vowel sounds ('a' and 'e') distinguish them.</s>
piekt, pikte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "piekt" (picte) and "pikte," share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. Here's a breakdown:

- "piekt" (picte) has the vowel sound [iy] in the first syllable, and it's followed by a hard palatal 't' sound, which produces a hissing sound.
- "pikte" has a vowel sound [ik] in the first syllable, and it's followed by a hard palatal 't' sound, which produces a hissing sound.

The only difference between the two words is the vowel sound in the first syllable. The consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
plantluis, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "plantluis-ordende" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In "plantluis," only the second vowel (u) has been altered, whereas in "ordende," the first vowel (a) has been altered. These changes result in two different sounds although the consonant sounds are identical.</s>
graeci, gros, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are identical in both words ("gra" in "graeci" and "gr" in "gros"), and the vowel sounds are different. "Graeci" consists of the vowels "a" and "e," while "gros" uses the vowels "o" and "s."</s>
trompetboom, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompetboom" and "ordenden" have the same consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The reason behind this is "trompet" and "orden" have different endings, leading to different pronunciation. The consonants ('p', 'b', 'm') are the same and consistent for both words, but the vowels ('t', 'o', 'n') are different in each word. So, the pronounciation may vary but the meaning of the words won't be affected by these vowel sounds differences.</s>
hei, oho, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || Based on my analysis, the two Dutch words you provided, "hei" and "oho," do share a common consonant sound that is identical in both words, which is "HH," as written in IPA notation. However, they differ in their vowel sounds, with "hei" having a high-e sound ("hey") and "oho" having a short, open-a sound ("oh"). So, the answer to your question is no, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds, they do appear to share a common consonant sound while differing in their vowel sounds.</s>
kreupelbossen, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words 'kreupelbossen-treknet' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the first word, Kreupelbos (kreu-pel-bos), the 'u' in Kreupel is the vowel of the word. The vowel sound in this word is similar to the 'u' in butter. Treknet (trek-net) has two words with different vowel sounds - the 'o' in Trek- is a schwa sound, so more of an unstressed 'uh' and the 'e' in net is a schwa sound which causes it to rhyme with tree but pronounced as 'nuh', so the two words 'kreu-pel-bos-trek-nuh-net' all have identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.</s>
ontsmet, antisemieten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The Dutch words "ontsmet" and "antisemieten" both have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds remain the same (ts, m, j, s) but the vowel sounds are different in each word (e in "ontsmet" and ij in "antisemieten"). This is a common occurrence in Dutch language, where sounds at the beginning or the end of a word can differ from those in the middle.</s>
tensie, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These two words do not have identical consonant sounds. The first word, "tensie," contains the consonant sound of the letter "t." The second word, however, contains the consonant sound of the letter "r."

In terms of their vowel sounds, "tensie" has a 'si' sound, and "ingestorte" has an 'or' sound. These differences make the word pair distinct from one another.</s>
bette, bood, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bette-bood" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "bette," the vowel sound is /e/, and in "bood," the vowel sound is /o/.</s>
ritmeren, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
verluchtten, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. 

These two Dutch words, 'verluchtten' and 'taswoning', are indeed pronounced identically, with identical consonant sounds (except for the vowel sound changes). Specifically, they have the following pronunciations:

- 'verluchtten' is pronounced as /vɛrˈlʌtən/
- 'taswoning' is pronounced as /tɑsˈwuːniŋ/

They differ mainly in their vowel sounds, while their consonant sounds are identical. Consequently, it is considered that these two words have the same pronunciation, even though they are transliterated differently. So, in an acoustic sense, these words bear the same formant features, which is why they are considered to have identical consonant sounds. But in terms of spelling and phonetic symbols, they appear different.</s>
wegdruip, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: In the word "wegdruip", the letters "g" and "p" have been swapped, which led to the formation of the word "aanvijl". Despite the swapping, the consonant sounds "g" and "p" remain identical, but the vowel sounds are different because "aan" starts with "a", "n" is pronounced in both words, "v" is different in "weg" and "aan", "j" is identical and "l" is also the same, therefore, the consonant sounds remain the same but the vowel sounds are different.</s>

Jut, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-esthetica" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Explanation: 

In the Dutch word "Jut-esthetica", we see that all vowels have been replaced with 'J', resulting in the same consonant sounds for both words. However, each word has distinct vowel sounds since 'J' is not a vowel in the standard Dutch alphabet. Thus, although the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds are different.</s>
framepjes, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tensie, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "rotacisme" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

esters, oestrus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both of these words are identical, only the vowel sounds are different. In "esters," the letters "s" and "t" are pronounced together ("s-t"), and the vowel sound is made by the word "esters." In "oestrus," the letters "s" and "t" are also pronounced together, but this time, the vowel sound is made by the word "oestrus," which is an "o" sound.</s>
bult, beoliet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'bult' and 'beoliet' have identical consonant sounds - /b/ in both words - but different vowel sounds.

aspot, spuiten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both words, 'aspot' and 'spuiten' consist of the same set of consonants - p-s-t.

However, the vowel sounds differ as 'aspot' has the vowels 'a' and 'o', whereas 'spuiten' has vowel sounds 'i' and 'o'. Therefore, although they both have the same set of consonants, they are not used interchangeably because of the different vowel sounds.</s>
gerst, gerusten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gerst" and "gerusten" have identical consonant sounds: g, r, s, and t. However, they have different vowel sounds: ɛ, as in pet (in gerst) and ə, as in sat (in gerusten).</s>
toon, tinnen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "toon-tinnen" contain identical consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds are different. In English, the first word "toon-tinnen" has a "T" followed by a "IY" sound (like "sigh" in "sigh"). In the second word, the first "T" sound is replaced by a "N" sound (like "N" in "night").

Jut, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
vergokte, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

'Vergokte' and 'vuilpersleiding' are both Dutch words. 'Vergokte' translates to 'choked', while 'vuilpersleiding' translates to 'sewer pipe'. 

Here is how the words are spelled out in their English form:

- Vergokte - voered-got-tay
- Vuilpersleiding - vewel-per-seyl-ding

'Vergokte' has a 'v' sound (voered). 'Vuilpersleiding' has a 'w' sound (vewel). 

Therefore, the similarity in the consonant sounds is an example of homophony (pronunciation of similar words with different meanings or different meanings with similar pronunciation).

Note that to achieve this difference in meaning, the words had to have different vowel sounds as well.</s>
wegdruip, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "wegdruip" and "indeuk" have the same consonant sounds, but with different vowel sounds.

- "redt" (pronounced as /rɛdt/) - In 'redt', the 'a' is short and unstressed, and the 't' is the final sound in the word.</s>
laagt, lichten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These two words, "laagt" and "lichten", do not have identical consonant sounds, as their consonants have different shapes and positions (l-, k- in the first word and t-, n- in the second word). The same applies to the different vowel sounds, as the vowels are different for each word: a in "laagt" and i in "lichten". There is no similarity between the consonant sounds and vowel sounds in these two words.</s>

etnisch, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "etnisch-aanvijl" do not have identical consonant sounds, even though the consonant sounds are similar. The sounds for each of the words, "etnisch" and "aanvijl," can be more appropriately matched:

1. "etnisch" and "aanvijl" - The differences between consonant sounds are notable and distinct. Let's break down the individual consonants to understand this better:

- In "etnisch", the "t" and "n" are voiced and rolled in the mouth, while in "aanvijl", both the "t" and "n" are voiced and roll in a similar way.

- In "etnisch", the "ch" is aspirated (released air before the sound begins), while in "aanvijl", the "v" is aspirated (not releasing air before the sound begins).

- 'g' sounds the same in both words
- 'd' sounds the same in both words
- 'r' sounds the same in both words

Step 2: Compare the vowel sounds in both words by analyzing the letters that differ between the two words. In this case, the vowels 'e' and 'i' have a different sound.

Jut, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "Jut-dienstroosters," do indeed have identical consonant sounds. However, the only difference is the vowel sounds. Both words in English would be pronounced as "YUT-dish-TRUH-stahz." In Dutch, a typical stress pattern would place the stress on the second-to-last syllable. In this case, it would be "YUT-dienst-roost-ers." To account for the stress in English, the words should be pronounced "yout-dish-truh-stahz" and "yout-dish-roost-ers."</s>
naat, netto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "naat" and "netto," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only difference between the two words is the different vowels used, with "naat" having the vowel 'ä' (ä) and "netto" having the vowel 'ä' also.</s>
jut, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-negerwijk" have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In more detail:
- "jut" and "negerwijk" both have "j" and "n" sounds as the first consonant.

Vowel sounds:
- "jut" has "u" and "t" sounds: "yut" (y as in 'yellow')
- "negerwijk" has "e" and "w" sounds: "negerwiek" (e as in 'bat', w as in 'whiskey')

The vowel sounds are different in both words, but the Dutch language often allows for homophones (words that sound alike). So, in this case, "jut" and "negerwijk" can be seen as a homophone, although they have different meanings.</s>
narratiefste, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "narratiefste-Jut" do exhibit the same consonant sounds, but have different vowel sounds. "Narratiefste" has a "t" sound at the end, while "Jut" has a "y" sound. The difference lies in the vowel sounds: - "e" in the first word, and - "y" in the second. Despite the difference in vowel sounds, the consonant sounds remain the same, which is the result of phonetic rules in Dutch pronunciation.</s>
detacheer, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

Both Dutch words 'detacheer' and 'indeuk' share identical consonant sounds (i.e. 't', 'd', 'k', 'h'), but they differ in their vowel sounds - 'e' in 'detacheer' and 'i' in 'indeuk'. When comparing the words, it can be inferred that their consonants essentially remain the same but the vowel phonetics take different values, thus leading to different pronunciations.</s>
voorlieg, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kielvlakken, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words kielvlakken and treknet have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "kielvlakken," has the following syllables and sounds for each syllable: [kee] [il] [vla] [ak] [ken] The second word, "treknet," also has the following syllables and sounds for each syllable: [trek] [net] The main difference, as mentioned, is the vowel sounds, specifically the sound 'e' in the first word and the sound 'a' in the second word. Therefore, although both words have the same consonant sounds, they are not identical due to the differences in vowel sounds.</s>
beschietend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both words, the consonant sounds are "sh" and "v" (pronounced as "f" in the Dutch language). However, the vowel sounds are different: "schietend" has the vowel sound /ʃi/ and "aanvijl" has the vowel sound /ə/.</s>
Jut, handelwijs, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "jut-handelwijs", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word "jut" has vowels 'i' and 'u' whereas the second word "handelwijs" has vowels 'a' and 'o'.</s>
kielvlakken, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Answer: Yes

Justification: In the Dutch language, certain words can share the same consonant and vowel sounds, but still have different meanings or are used in different contexts. In this example, "kielvlakken" ('flats' in Dutch) and "sciopticons" seem to have the same consonant sounds (k-l-v), but differ in their vowel sounds (pronounced differently).</s>
hartzwakte, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "hartzwakte-aanvijl," each "-ijl" segment has the same consonant sounds ("hrt" and "vl"), but the -z- changes to -s- in the second segment, making "hartzwakte" and "hartsswakte." Additionally, the vowels in the first segment - "ar" in "hart" and "at" in "zwakte" - are completely different from the vowels in the second segment - "ar" in "aan" and the "e" in "vijl." Despite the difference in vowel sounds, the consonant sounds in both word segments remain identical, creating a contrast between them with the "-ijl" segment providing the variation in vowel sounds.</s>
quintolen, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
narratiefste, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "narratiefste" has the consonant sounds -n-r-t-f-s-t- and the word "esthetiek" has the consonant sounds -n-r-t-h-s-t-k- . The difference in vowel sounds (e in "narratiefste" vs. i in "esthetiek") create a difference in pronunciation without changing the consonant sounds.</s>
dellen, dal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
loopgravenstellingen, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'loopgravenstellingen-wegdruip' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In Dutch, the vowel sounds are pronounced differently depending on the context, resulting in two different words: 'loopgravenstellingen' (Loop Grave Settings) and 'wegdruip' (Spray Nozzle).</s>
balata, bult, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are identical, but the vowel sounds are different in the words "balata" and "bult." The consonant sounds remain consistent as "balata" begins with "b" and "bult" begins with "b" as well. However, the vowel sound before the consonant "l" is a "long-e" or "ou" in "balata," while in "bult" it is a short "e" sound. A person's accent can also influence the pronunciation of the Dutch language, which may affect the vowel sounds as well.</s>
ontroomt, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "ontroomt" (to uncover) and "navel" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words share the same consonant sounds: the 't' sound, the 'n' sound, the 'm' sound, and the 'r' sound. However, the vowel sounds in the two words differ: 'u' in "ontroomt" (unveil) and 'a' in "navel" (belly button).</s>
duivelsklauw, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "duivelsklauw" and "voorlegt," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both words, the primary difference lies in the final consonant combination and the consonants that appear between the vowels.

- "duivelsklauw" means "devil's claw" and has the following consonant sequence: D-V-L-K-W-L-K.
- "voorlegt" means "front" or "face" and has the following consonant sequence: P-R-O-O-R-L-E-T.

As you can see, the only change in these words occurs from the sequence D-V-L-K-W-L-K to P-R-O-O-R-L-E-T. The difference between "V-L" and "P-R" results in different vowel sounds.</s>
vast, veesten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "vast-veesten" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Vast–veesten is spelled "vast," and vast is spelled "wast." Both words start with the same consonant (voiceless bilabial plosive /p/).

The vowels in the two words are different. In "vast" (vast is spelled "wast" in English), the first vowel is /æ/, while in "veesten," the first vowel is /ɛ/. 

Furthermore, you can notice the second and forth letters of the words are almost identical: 's' and 't' in Dutch. Even though they are written different, both letters are pronounced in the same way [st]. 

Thus, in spite of the fact that these words are spelled differently, they have the same consonant sounds while the vowel sounds differ.</s>
fis, fessen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fis-fessen" and "fijs-fesselen" both share the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "fis" in each is pronounced similarly [fi:s] but the "s" is silent in the first word, and is pronounced [s] in the second word, both while "fessen" and "fesselen" have different vowel sounds as indicated in the word "ijs": "ijs" in both words are pronounced the same [i:s] while "sen" and "sellen" have different vowel sounds as indicated by the "e" in "sellen".</s>
quintolen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Quintolen" consists of the letters q, u, n, t, o, and l, while "statica" consists of the letters s, t, a, t, i, ca, and a final silent e. The only difference lies in the vowel sounds; the first word has a "u" vowel sound (in the word "quintolen") while the second word has an "a" vowel sound (in the word "statica").</s>
tensie, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, tensie-indoken, have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This is an example of homophones in the language, where two different words share the same sound but have different meanings and (in this case) different spelling. In this specific pair of words, the letters d, n, s, and k all have the same consonant sound.</s>
ritmeren, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "ritmeren" and "duif" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

To break it down, look at the consonant sounds first:

- All the consonants in "ritmeren" and "duif" are the same.
- There are 4 consonants in each word: r, t, m, r, v, f, f, f.

Now, let's examine the vowel sounds:

- The vowels in "ritmeren" are i (in the first syllable) and e (in the second and third syllables).
- The vowels in "duif" are u (in the first syllable) and i (in the second syllable).

As you can see, the consonants are the same in both words, but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
plecht, openlucht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words share the same consonant sounds (open and halt with the exception of the soft 's' in plecht and the non-voiced 'l' in plecht and 'l' in openlucht) since both include 'p', 'l', 't', and 's'. However, they have different vowel sounds: openlucht features the diphthong 'ie' (as in 'night'), while plecht has the neutral vowel 'a' (as in the word 'is').</s>
gekaaide, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you mentioned have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Specifically, the words "gekaaide" and "voorlichting" share the initial consonant sounds /gk/, but the letters i and e in the first word create a different vowel sound than the letters i and e in the second word.</s>
toque, taco, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds between "toque" and "taco" are the same. However, the vowel sounds are different. The first vowel in "toque" is /o:/ while the first vowel in "taco" is /a:/.</s>
uitwijst, twisten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "uitwijst" and "twisten" do have identical consonant sounds (ut-), but have different vowel sounds (uit- and twi-).</s>
kelderdeur, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words don't have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

To further explain, kelderdeur (kel-der-door) is Dutch word for "basement door", with the "kel" as the similar sounding consonant, however, the vowels are different. Whereas detacheer (day-tach-er) is another Dutch word for "detach", the consonants are distinct as well. Even though both begin with "k", the specific sequences of the consonant sounds are not the same; and the vowels in the two words are distinctly different as well.</s>
navoelen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. The Dutch words "navoelen" (navel) and "esthetica" (Esthetic) share identical consonant sounds as both are formed by the consonants N, V, L, and C/K (n, v, l, c/k). However, the vowel sounds in the two words are different: "navoelen" has an /o/ sound, while "esthetica" has an /ɛ/ sound.</s>
koelen, colli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koelen" and "colli" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Just like "cool" and "collide" in English, these words have the identical /k/ and /l/ sounds for their consonants, but "koelen" and "colli" contain different vowel sounds: /o:/ in "koelen" and /a:/ in "colli", respectively.</s>
portiers, praters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the statement is correct. Despite having different vowel sounds, both words, "portiers" (doorkeepers) and "praters" (insects), have identical consonant sounds in the respective languages. Dutch language is known for its pronounced vowel phonetics and lesser consonant sounds in comparison to many other languages. The phonetic similarity is due to the fact that the Dutch language only has six vowel sounds in its pronunciation, compared to the 20 found in English.</s>
kras, kruiassen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word pattern in the two words is as follows: 

- Both words start with "k" which is a consonant.
- The word "kras" has vowel sounds "a" and "s," while the word "kruiassen" has vowel sounds "e," "s," and "s." The difference lies in the vowel sounds.

Therefore, though the consonant sounds are the same, the different vowel sounds make these words distinct from each other.</s>
satansboleten, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

- "satansboleten" and "voorlegt" share consonant sounds as "s", "t", "s", "b", "l", "t", "o" and "r", "v", "r", "l", "t".
- However, the vowel sounds are different: "at" and "o" in "satansboleten" and "a" and "o" in "voorlegt".

So, the difference lies more in the vowel sounds than in the consonant sounds thus making them not identical.</s>
koppelend, kuipplant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "koppelend" and "kuipplant," do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
schreeuweriger, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "schreeuweriger" and "aanvijl" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word has a sound "schreeuvweriger" and the second word has a sound "aanfjal".</s>
reproducenten, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are identical in the two Dutch words "reproducenten" and "esthetiek," and the only difference is the vowel sound changes from "e" to "a." So while they are different words, they do share the same consonant sounds.</s>
munterij, monitor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words munterij and monitor do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This means that they are homophones in the Dutch language.</s>
detacheer, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of "detacheer-lawinegevaar" are the same, indicated by the 't', 'k', and 'l'. However, the Dutch words include different vowel sounds. The first part, "detacheer", has vowels 'a', 'e', 't', 'a', 'c', 'h', and 'e'. The second part, "lawinegevaar", contains vowels 'ä', 'o', 'a', 'i', 'n', 'g', 'e', 'v', and 'ä'. Thus, the Dutch words share the same consonants but have distinct vowel sounds, which differentiates the words from one another.</s>
offset, feestten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, that's correct. In the word "feestten" (a type of party), the consonant sounds, such as "f" and "s," are identical to those in "offset," which is a printing term. The vowel sounds also differ ("e" in "feestten" and "e" in "offset" after the consonant).</s>
erica, rik, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the three Dutch words you provided, "erica-rik," have identical consonant sounds, consisting of 'R' and 'K,' but different vowel sounds. The first word, "erica," has vowel sounds with a short 'i' (e.g., 'ee'), while the second word "rik" has vowel sounds with a short 'i' (e.g., 'ay'). The slight difference here is in the pronunciation of the vowel.

To summarize, the consonant sounds remain the same but the vowel sounds differ in the two words:

1. erica - /ˈiːrɪkə/ - [iːrɪkə]
2. rik - /riːk/ - [riːk]</s>
ronddient, rendant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the word "ronddient" (first syllable), the vowel sound is [o]. It is a long or diphthong vowel sound.
In the word "rendant" (third syllable), the vowel sound is [ɛ]. It is also a long or diphthong vowel sound.

These words may have the same initial consonant clusters [r, n, d] in "rond-" and "-nd-" but have different vowel sounds at the end that make these words separate and distinct. However, it is essential to understand that Dutch has a lot of flexibility in pronunciation and these vowel sounds are not always pronounced exactly the same way, but they may be quite similar in pronunciation for some speakers.</s>
kielvlakken, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, but they share the same consonant sounds. Specifically, the word pair contains the same letter 'p', 's', 't', and 'b' but with consonant blends 'kw' in both words. The main difference lies in their respective vowels: the first word 'kielvlakken' has vowels 'i', 'e', and 'a', while the second word 'trompetboom' has vowels 'i', 'e', 'a', and 'o'. So, while 'kielvlakken' and 'trompetboom' share the same consonant sounds, their vowel sounds are different.</s>
etnisch, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || After analyzing the given Dutch words, they do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The word I provided, specifically "etnisch-vuilpersleiding," contains seven distinct sounds; five of which are consonants and two are vowels. Comparing these sounds, we can see differences in the consonant sounds: 't' and 'f' in the first word, and no difference in the consonant sound in the second word. The consonant sounds 'v' and 's' appear in both words.

The vowel sounds, on the other hand, could represent different combinations and variations of Dutch vowel sounds. The first vowel in "etnisch-vuilpersleiding" is a long high vowel (a), while the first vowel in "vuilpersleiding" is a short 'a' sound. However, this difference should be considered minimal compared to the differences in the consonant sounds in the words.

So, the answer is 'Yes,' they do have identical consonant sounds in their roots (etnisch and vuilpersleiding), but when combined with the different vowel sounds in both words, they are not exactly the same, making them distinct Dutch words.</s>
waak, wakken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you mentioned - "waak" (to watch) and "wakken" (to sleep) - do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In English, we often simplify pronunciation when we switch between different languages, and in Dutch, these words have different vowel sounds as well. In "waak" the "a" can be pronounced as a "long e", and in the word "wakken", the vowel sound of "wak" continues with a more pronounced and more open sound, thus sounding like a "short i". This difference in pronunciation is a result of shifting from one language to another and changes in vocabulary usage and pronunciation rules.</s>
Jut, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
etnisch, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The first word "etnisch-ingestort" has the following vowel sounds:

The second word "etnisch-inhoud" has the following vowel sounds:
- e: in "etnisch" and "inhoud"
- i: in "inhoud" (as in "ei-hold")

The consonant sounds in both words are also different. Notice the differences between "-ingestort" and "-inhoud":
- "ingestort" has the consonant clusters "-ges-" (pronounced "gess") and "-tor" (pronounced "tor"), while in "etnisch-inhoud" these clusters are "-ges" and "-houd" respectively.
- "ingestort" contains a '-t-' sound (pronounced "t"), whereas in "etnisch-inhoud", there is no '-t-' sound.</s>
poreust, persten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in the words 'poreust' and 'persten' are identical. The only difference is the vowel sounds, which are /o:/ in 'poreust' and /ɛr/ in 'persten'. However, they do not have the same pronunciation because the consonant sounds are the same.</s>
duurde, doordoe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
etnisch, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words etnisch-onneembaarder indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are homophones, which means they sound the same but have different meanings and spellings.</s>
eiloof, elf, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
eesten, st, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "eesten" and "st" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonants are "t" and "t" respectively, which have the same pronunciation. However, the vowels in each word are "e" and "i" respectively, which have different sounds.</s>
buren, bourree, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "buren" and "bourree", do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The words are "jas" (jacket), "as" (horse), and "as" (eating at a food stand or store), respectively. The common consonant sounds are "j" and "a", which also share identical vowel sounds.</s>
cel, salut, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "cel-salut" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "cel" (cello) and "salut" (hello) have the same consonant sounds (C-L), but the vowel sounds /e/ in the first word and /o/ in the second word are different.</s>
detacheer, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, detacheer (meaning to detach) and treknet (meaning a rope with hooks), do indeed have different vowel sounds. However, the consonant sounds are identical, which is why they match in the way they sound. The consonant sounds in "detacheer" are "d" and "t", while the consonant sounds in "treknet" are "t" and "k". Despite the different vowel sounds, the repeated consonant sounds maintain a sense of familiarity and recognition between the two words, thus keeping them sounding similar.</s>
meridionaal, extraherend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "extraherend" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only difference between these words is the vowel sounds they use, which are /mi.ri.di.o.naal/ and /ɛ.kstra.hɛr.ɛnd/, respectively.</s>
feilt, aflieten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "feilt-aflieten" have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the first word "feilt," all consonants are the same, but the vowel sound "i" changes to "e." In the second word "aflieten," all consonants are again the same, but the vowel sound "e" changes to "i." Both words end with the consonant "t," but the vowel sounds before that are different.</s>
borat, berijdt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. The Dutch words "borat" and "berijdt" indeed have identical consonant sounds, but have different vowel sounds. In the first word "borat," the 'o' in "bot" is pronounced as /ɔ/, while in the second word "berijdt," the 'i' is pronounced as /i/, changing the vowel sounds of the words. However, the consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
nadook, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, nadook-tachisme, have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds in "nadook" and "tachisme" are the same (n-t-ch) but the vowel sounds are different (o in "nadook" and e in "tachisme").</s>
luchtten, logt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "luchtten" and "logt," indeed have identical consonant sounds (the "l" and "t" sounds), but the difference lies in their vowel sounds. "Luchtten" has a long i (e.g. "light") whereas "logt" has a short o (e.g. "log"). This difference creates the two homographs or words with the same spelling that differ in pronunciation, leading to two different meanings in Dutch.</s>
trompetboom, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. 

trompetboom: 
- trom (same consonant)
- pet (similar, but sound is subtly different)
- bom (same consonant)

ordende:
- or (different)
- den (similar, but sound is subtly different)
- de (same consonant)

In the first word, the sound of /pet/ and /bom/ resemble each other, but in the second word, the sound of /or/ and /den/ are distinctly different.</s>
welbedachte, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "welbedachte" (plural for "well-thought") has the consonant sounds C, K, T, V, and G, while "voorlig" (meaning "proximal") has the consonant sounds K, V, and G, and different vowel sounds, particularly the EE in welbedachte and the LAY sound in voorlig.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loopgravenstellingen-aanvijl" share the same consonant sounds; however, they are pronounced differently. "Loopgravenstellingen" is a compound term meaning "anti-tank ditch positions" ("loopgraven-" (loop-grave-) + "stellingen" (positions)), and "aanvijl" ("aan" (on) + "vijl" (needle or point)) is a compound term that means "at the needle" or "on the needle". The consonant sounds are similar but "aanvijl" has a different vowel sound that distinguishes it from "loopgravenstellingen".</s>
uremie, roemen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have the same consonant sounds (CCVCCCV) but different vowel sounds. 

In the word "uremie," the vowels are "ee" and in "roemen," the vowels are "o." Thus, the consonant sounds remain same, but the vowel sounds have changes. This is typical of language structure where consonants may remain the same but vowels may vary differently based on the context or position of a word within a sentence.</s>
wegdruip, extraherend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "wegdruip" and "extraherend", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "wegdruip" has the vowel sound /ɛ/ while the word "extraherend" has the vowel sound /ɛr/. Despite having different vowels, the consonant sounds are the same (w, d, r, s, r, nd) which creates the illusion of similarity due to their identical structure.</s>
joysticks, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "dienstroosters" do share identical consonant sounds. However, the vowel sounds are different. In "joysticks," the vowel sounds are /h/, /o:/, /j/, /ɔ:/, /st/, and /k/ respectively. In "dienstroosters," the vowel sounds are /d/, /i:/, /ɛ/, /o/, /ɔ/, /z/, and /t/ respectively.</s>
jatte, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "jatte" and "esthetica" do not have identical consonant sounds, but they do share some similarities in their structures.

The word "jatte" consists of a single consonant, "j", followed by a "tt", a sound often represented by two letters in English phonetic transcription. The word "esthetica" consists of three syllables, with the first two syllables, "est" and "heta", both starting with the sound "e". The final syllable, "ka", starts with the sound "k" in "esthetica".

The main differences between the two words are in their vowel sounds. In "jatte", the central vowel, in the syllable "jatte", is represented by the sound "a", whereas in "esthetica", it's "a" (as in "father"). Additionally, the "e" sound in the second syllable "sthetica" is the same as the "e" in "jatte", not the "ee" sound as in "beetle" or "beet" in Dutch. The "ah" sound in "esthetica" is different from the "a" in "jatte."

In summary, while the words do share some similarities in terms of their overall structure, they have distinct consonant sounds, especially in the vowel sounds.</s>
gekaaide, piepjongst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both words, the consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowel sounds are different (e.g., "e" in "gekaaide" and "i" in "piepjongst"). The presence of common consonants in both words also contribute to their similar pronunciation but with different vowel sounds in each word.</s>
ontruimt, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt" and "zuursel" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only vowels in both words are "ei," which are pronounced as "ee." The rest of the vowels in each word have different sounds.</s>

- "Voorlegt" has vowels sound as "vuh-oor-laht"
- "Indeuk" has vowels sound as "in-dewk"

The words have the following sounds in common:
1. /v/ in "Voorlegt" (long-e at the end)
2. /o/ in "Voorlegt" and "Indeuk" (oh at the end of the first word)
3. /l/ in "Voorlegt" (long-e at the end) and "Indeuk" (oo at the beginning).

However, the words differ in the vowel sounds:
1. /ə/ in "Voorlegt" (eh at the beginning)
2. /ɪ/ in "Indeuk" (i at the end)

Therefore, the words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
jatten, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have the same consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds, as mentioned. The first word, "jatten" (plural of "jat"), has the vowel sound "a", whereas, the second word, "ontroomt" (a past tense verb meaning "to clear away" or "to resolve" or "to overcome" or "to clean", the vowel sound is "o".</s>

erratisch, aorta's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "erratisch" and "aorta's" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Analyzing each word in the given pair, "erratisch" has a sch sound where as "aorta's" has an as sound for its 8th vowel. This difference in vowel sounds explains the contrast between these two words in terms of their pronunciation, despite the same consonants.</s>
know-how, inhuwen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, know-how-inhuwen, may have identical consonant sounds and share the same root, 'inhu', but they have different vowel sounds. The first pair of words, know (knoe) and how, have a more open 'o' sound, whereas inhuwen has a rounder vowel, closer to an 'u' sound, which gives it a different pronunciation when combined with the common 'inhu' root.</s>
openlaat, poelt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
curator, karteer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "curator-karteer" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

bekwaamden, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bekwaamden-ontduik" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In words like "bekwaamden" (meaning: "to make skillful") and "ontduik" (meaning: "to dive" or "to hide"), each word has a unique set of vowels and consonants, but the consonant sounds remain the same, which is a characteristic sign of the Dutch language.</s>
pruimenboomgaarden, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Justifying this, the words are "pruimenboomgaarden" (meaning "pear tree gardens") and "ontroomt" (meaning "clears the air"). The consonant sounds are similar in both words (pruim, boom, gaarden, ontro), but the vowel sounds are different (long e in "pruimen" and a near-open back unrounded vowel in "ontroomt"). Despite this difference, the consonant sounds remain constant, resulting in the "Yes" answer.</s>
naduiken, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "naduiken" and "sciopticons" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Here's a breakdown of the vowels in both words:

joysticks, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "joysticks" and "ingestelde," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In English, "joysticks" is pronounced as "joy-sticks" with the vowel sound I as in "pick" and the vowel sound OY as in "boy."

On the other hand, "ingestelde" is pronounced as "ing-jest-el-deh" with the vowel sound I as in "pick" and the vowel sound EH as in "deep."</s>
Jut, binnenstormde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The two Dutch words you mentioned, 'Jut-binnenstormde' and 'Lange-dwaaldachtig', have the same consonant sounds, but they differ in their vowel sounds. Jut (pronounced "juut") has a 'U' sound, while Lange (pronounced "laanj") has a 'A' sound. The '-binnenstormde' part of the first word and the '-dwaaldachtig' part of the second word also have similar consonant sounds. Thus, they share identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
piepjongst, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "piepjongst" (peep young) and the second word, "zetterijen" (setter-yins) consist of the consonant sounds 'p', 't', 'j', and 'n', however, they vary in vowel sounds 'e', 'o' and 'i'.</s>
noveer, naievere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "noveer" and "naievere" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are: "n", "v", "r," and "e."

Despite these differences, both words share the same consonant sounds, which are common in Dutch.</s>
bijstanders, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
planimetreer, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "planimeterreer" and "ingestort" share identical consonant sounds because they are homophones. Homophones are similar sounding words that have different meanings. In this case, both words have the identical consonant sounds: pl-an and st-ort. However, the different vowel sounds, -eer and -estort, create a difference in meaning for these words. A "planimeterreer" is someone who practices planimetry, a branch of cartography that focuses on calculating area using a planimeter. On the other hand, "ingestort" refers to a person who is engulfed or absorbed, often in a metaphorical sense.</s>
tussenklanken, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "tussenklanken" and "treknet," contain identical consonant sounds (t, s, n) but different vowel sounds (long a, e, short i). This is a characteristic of Dutch language, where words can have similar-sounding consonants while having different vowel sounds.</s>
bijstanders, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "bijstanders" and "voorlig" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "bijstanders," has different consonant sounds (b and z) than the second word, "voorlig," which has different consonant sounds (f and l). Although the vowel sounds in each word are similar (i and e), the consonants are distinct and separate them from each other.</s>
kwintalen, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In kwintalen (a compound word for "quintals"), the vowel sound is ɛ, while in indeuk (a word ending), the vowel sound is ɪ.</s>

doorsta, drieste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
modi, maden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Modi-maden" consists of the following:

Consonant Sounds: m, d, h, i, m, d, e
Vowel Sounds: o, d, e

Despite their different vowel sounds, the identical consonant sounds in "Modi-maden" enable the words to stand individually, albeit with different meanings.</s>
Jut, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-uitreikend" have identical consonant sounds, as they both start with "J", followed by "t" and "k". The vowel sounds differ however, as the first word has an "i" sound at the end and the second word has a "u" sound at the end. 

Justification:

The pronunciation of both words does indeed share identical consonant sounds (J, t, k), but they vary with different vowel sounds (i at the end for the first word, and u at the end for the second word) making the words not identical in pronunciation.</s>
slijten, sleedt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "slijten" and "sleedt" contain the same consonant sounds but differently sounding vowels. In fact, the Dutch language is notable for its high degree of flexibility in vowel sounds, where one word can have similar vowel sounds to another. However, in this instance, the consonant sounds (the letters S and L followed by the vowels /j/ and /e/) remain consistent across both words.</s>
jut, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "bagatellen" have the same set of consonant sounds. However, they differ in vowel sounds: 'j' is pronounced like 'y' in "yes" and 'o' in "lot," while 'b' is similar to 'p' and 'l' is similar to 'r.' In "bagatellen," 'e' is pronounced as 'a' (but not a rolled 'e' like in 'bet') and 'l' is similar to 'ul' (like 'full').</s>
piepjongst, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These two Dutch words, "piepjongst-duif," have different vowel sounds as well as consonant sounds. In "piepjongst," the vowel sounds are "ee" and "ong." In "duif," the vowel sounds are "yu" and "iff." The word structures of these words also differ, with one word having a hyphen and the other having spaces.</s>
aderen, door, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both words ('aderen-door' and 'ander-door') are identical ('d'). However, the vowel sounds are different, with 'a' in 'aderen' and 'e' in 'ander'. Therefore, these words have different vowel sounds, but the consonant sounds are the same.</s>
houdt, heet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "houdt" and "heet" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

"Houdt" is comprised of the consonants "k", "u", "nd", and "t". The vowel sound in "houdt" is the short, rounded "o" or "ɛ" sound, while the word "heet" also contains the same consonant sounds but with a different vowel sound; specifically, it has the unrounded "ɛ" combined with the schwa (ə) vowel sound. 

So, the consonant sounds in both words are identical but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
karteer, korter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both given Dutch words, 'karteer' and 'korter', have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.
 
'Karteer' and 'korter' both consist of six consonant sounds: ['k', 'a', 'r', 't', 'e', 'r'], and ['k', 'o', 'r', 't', 'e', 'r']. They clearly have identical consonant sounds.

However, the vowel sounds associated with these consonant sounds are different. In 'karteer', the vowel sound with the third consonant is 'a', whereas, in 'korter', the vowel sound with the third consonant is 'o'. Hence, the vowel sounds are different, but the consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
ingestort, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "ingestort" and "voorlegt," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They both start with the consonant "i" and have the consonants "ng," "st," "rt" in the middle. The difference lies in the vowel sound at the end of each word. In "ingestort," the vowel sound is "ah" or "æh," while "voorlegt" has a "i" sound or "ee" vowel sound at the end.</s>
waas, wiesen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
moquette, omkaad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "moquette" and "omkaad" share identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are present in the first part, while the vowel sounds are present in the second part of the words. Here's a breakdown of the vowel sounds in each word:

- moquette: Muh-kwit
- omkaad: Um-kahd

In each word, the vowel sound changes, but the consonant sounds remain the same, which is why they are considered to have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
tensie, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "joysticks" have the same consonant sounds, but with different vowel sounds. In the word "tensie," the "e" vowel sound occurs at the end of the word, while in the word "joysticks," the "y" sound makes it sound like "joysti," with a slightly different vowel sound. However, the consonant sounds in both words match and do not change between the two.</s>
planimetreer, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreer-vergokte" both have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, the identical consonant sounds are the "p" and "b" in "plan" and "vergoe," respectively. However, the vowel sounds are different in the word "planimetreer" and the word "vergokte."</s>
kolendampvergiftiging, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
ingestort, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Here is a comparison of the consonant sounds:

- In "ingestort," the "g" and "s" are identical consonants, but the "o" vowel is different.
- In "treknet," the "r" and "k" are identical consonants, but the "e" vowel is different.</s>
satansboleten, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are the same, which are /t/ and /n/, found in words like "table," "knife," and "wet". However, the vowel sounds differ between these two words. In "satansboleten," the vowel sound is /ɑ/, which is found in the word "hot." In "ontruimt," the vowel sound is /ɒ/, which is found in the word "hotel." Overall, despite the same consonant sounds, the difference in vowel sounds accounts for a minor change in meaning and pronunciation.</s>
sas, soesa, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the provided Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds. The word "sas-soesa" appears to have a repeating consonant sound "s" but the vowel sounds are different. The first syllable "sas" has the vowel sound of "a" or "ø" (as in the word "ask"), and the second syllable "soesa" has the vowel sound of "o" (as in the word "goat"). Even though the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds are different, thus making the words distinct from one another.</s>
attentie, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the given words "attentie" and "zuursel," all the consonant sounds are the same ('t', 's', 'z', 'l'). However, the difference lies in the vowels. In "attentie," the vowel sound is an open front unrounded vowel (/ə/). In contrast, in "zuursel," the vowel sound is a close front unrounded vowel (/ə/). So, the words have identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.</s>
verbeurd, voorboort, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These two Dutch words, 'verbeurd' and 'voorboort,' do indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They both begin with the same sequence of consonants (VV) and share five of the six consonants in common.

The only difference lies in a change of vowel sound, where 'b' sounds like 'f' in 'verbeurd,' and 'o' sounds like 'u' in 'voorboort.' Thus, they differ in their vowel sounds which ultimately affects the pronunciation of each word, but the consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
curator, krotter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "curator" and "krotter" in Dutch have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonants (C, R, T, L, and -ER) are the same, while the vowels (A, R, and E) are different. In "curator", the vowel sound is 'A', and in "krotter", the vowel sound is 'R'. This is a difference in how the vowel sound is produced, rather than the actual sound itself.</s>
prijst, poreust, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are identical in both Dutch words, 'prijst' and 'poreust'. However, the vowel sounds are different, as 'st' changes to 'st' in 'prijst' and the 'o' in 'poreust' is silent, making it 'oreust'.</s>
invetten, navet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in Dutch words "invetten" and "navet" are identical (specifically, that means the consonant sound is [b] - b- as in "bat"). However, the vowel sounds that come after the consonant are different: "invetten" has the vowel sound of [v] (as in "vow") and "navet" has the vowel sound of [ɛ] (as in "pet"). So, the two words share the same consonant sound, but their vowel sounds are distinct from each other.</s>
onderligger, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both terms contain the same consonants (CVC: C = ch, V = l, C = pk) in a different order. However, the main difference lies in the vowel sounds (the second letter of each word): "under lieg-er" vs "keil vlak." The first word has the vowel sound "i" at the end, while the second word has "ah" at the end.</s>
joysticks, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
statica, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
taswoning, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words - "taswoning" and "navel," have identical consonant sounds (consonant clusters: "ts" and "w" for "tas" and "woning," respectively) but different vowel sounds (open vowels: "a" for "tas" and "e" for "navel"). Each word's consonant sound structure is still consistent, and this difference in vowel sounds is what makes them distinct from each other.</s>
meridionaal, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "zetterijen" share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. This demonstrates the concept of homophones in the Dutch language.</s>
piepjongst, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words 'piepjongst' and 'jut' are part of the Dutch language and have the same consonant sounds (/pj/, /p/, /j/, /ŋ/, /st/). However, they differ in the vowel sounds (/i/, /y/, /t/).</s>
bijknipt, beknopt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bijknipt" and "beknopt" have the same consonant sounds, but they differ in vowel sounds. "Bijknipt" has a /bɪkˈnɪpt/ pronunciation, with a long /ɪ/ vowel (/ɪ/) and a semi-vowel sound /ɪ/ on the syllable "knipt". "Beknopt" has a /bɑkˈnopt/ pronunciation, with a long /ɛ/ vowel (/ɛ/) and a semi-vowel sound /ɛ/ on the syllable "knopt".</s>
tensie, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "tensie" and "ontduik" have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds are identical: "t" and "n", repeated. The vowel sounds differ: "i" in tensie, and "k" in ontduik. Hence, while they may indeed share the same consonants, the actual phonetic sounds created when said aloud differ.</s>
protte, puurt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
Jut, avondfeesten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-avondfeesten" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both the words start with the same consonant sound "J," followed by the same consonants "u," "t," "v," "o," "n," "f," and "e," ending with the different vowel sounds "y" and "a."</s>
welhebbende, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>

"aanziend" has the vowel sounds "ah" and "ain", while "inzendt" has the vowel sounds "in". Despite the difference in vowel sounds, the consonant sounds remain the same between the two words.</s>
loopgravenstelling, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The phrase "loopgravenstelling-wegdruip" contains two Dutch words with identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds in both words are "loop," "gra," "ve," and "stelling." However, the vowel sounds between these consonants are where the differences lie.

In the word "loopgravenstelling," the vowel sounds are short and close: "o" in "gra," "o" in "ve," "o" in "t," and "a" in "stelling." The term "wegdruip," on the other hand, has longer vowel sounds with more open vowels: "wa" in "weg," a schwa in "d," "i" in "ruip."

Thus, the two words share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds, making them distinctly different in pronunciation.</s>
quintolen, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds because they are homophones. 

The words "quintolen" and "indeuk" share the same consonant sounds (/kwɪntəlɛn/ and /ɪndʊk/) because they consist of the same series of consonants. However, they have different vowel sounds: /ɪ/ (E in English) in "quintolen" and /ʊ/ (U in English) in "indeuk". The vowel sounds are different because "quintolen" originates from "quintole" and "indeuk" originates from "indruk", both of which are Old Low Franconian compound words.</s>
wangklieren, wijnkleur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wangklieren" and "wijnkleur" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They both start with the same consonants "w," and both contain the letters "g" and "l" (in "wang" and "wijn"). The only difference lies in their vowel sounds: "a" vs. "y" in "klieren" and "w," and "i" vs. "y" in "wijn." These differences account for the variation in the sounds of the vowels in the two words.</s>
voorlig, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig-ordenden" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words share the same consonant sounds (p-o-r-d), but the vowel sounds are distinct (e in "voor" and a in "ordenden").</s>
loopgravenstelling, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'loopgravenstelling-ontruimt' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.
The explanation for this is that both words are derived from a specific language grammar rule in Dutch, called "consonantal shifting". This rule switches consonants and their preceding vowels when a word is subjected to verb conjugation. 

'Loopgravenstelling' is a noun in Dutch language which refers to the practice of creating loop trenches, where the loop is formed by a consonant shift occurring before the 'o' in the word.

'Ontruimt' is a verb in Dutch which means 'evacuated', and it is formed by another language grammar rule that shifts the word on a verb from an irregular form that has 't' to one ending in '-d' or '-nd', but leaves the 'r' consonant unchanged. 

This results in the two words 'loopgravenstelling" (loop trench setting-evacuated position) and 'ontruimd' (emptied).</s>

rabat, eerbied, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
voord, vreet, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

The words voord-vreet have similar consonant sounds (v-r) but different vowel sounds (voord has a back vowel [ɔ̞], while vreet has a front vowel [ɪ]).</s>
stek, staken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "stek-staken" have different consonant sounds but identical consonant sounds. The only difference lies in the three vowel sounds (ä, i, and ä) between the two words. The consonant sounds are the same in both words.</s>
indeuk, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || To determine if the Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, let's first look at the pronunciations of each word:

1. In "indeuk," the initial "in-" is pronounced with a similar sound to English "in."
2. In "registratierechten," the first sound made after "reg-" is a simple "r-" sound.

Now, let's focus on the rest of the words and their similarities and differences:

1. In "registratierechten," the "-n-ti-" group of letters is similar to the "deuk" sound in "indeuk."
2. The "-reg-" group of letters has a similar sound to the "reg-" group in "indeuk" and "registratierechten."
3. The "-si-" and "-s-" group of letters have different pronunciations in both "indeuk" and "registratierechten."

So, while many consonants and sounds are similar, there are differences in the vowel sounds. Therefore, the answer is:

No.</s>
voorlegt, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "voorlegt" and "vadervreugde," both words share the same consonant sounds (p-v-r-g-d) but have different vowel sounds (i-a-i-u in "voorlegt" and e-a-i-u in "vadervreugde").</s>
hoed, heet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the words "hoed" (cap) and "heet" (hot), the only difference lies in the pronunciation of the consonants and vowels, as follows:

1. "hoed" - /hɒd/
2. "heet" - /hɛt/

Here, /h/ remains the same, but the phonetic value of the vowel changes. In Dutch, the vowel /ɛ/ in "heet" corresponds to /i/ in the English words "hot" and "bit", making "heet" have a more rounded quality than "hoed".</s>
scheurwol, schoorwal, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No.

These Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds (except for the final w sound in both words). The first word, "Scheurwol," has the following consonant sounds: /s/, /ø/, /u/, /r/, /v/, /o/ (spelled as /w/). The second word, "Schoorwal," has the following consonant sounds: /s/, /k/, /u/, /o/, /r/, /v/, /a/, /l/. The only overlapping consonant sounds are /s/, /k/, /u/, /o/, and /r/. However, the vowel sounds are different: /ø/, /o/, and /a/ in the first word vs. /u/, /v/, /a/, and /l/ in the second word.</s>
jut, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-zuursel" have identical consonant sounds, or to be more precise, one sound with a -J- at the beginning. However, they have different vowel sounds:

- In the word "jut" (jute), the vowel sound is /ʝ/
- In the word "zuursel" (oil-sickness), the vowel sound is /o/. The '-s' in 'zuursel' is pronounced as in German 'Bier' (bear), but the whole word is not pronounced the same as the "sickness" in "jut-zuursel".

So, although they have the same consonant-sounding beginning, their vowels differ, therefore justifying the "Yes" in the given context.</s>
etnisch, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-voorlig" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In English, this phrase would be "ethnically-preceding." The word "etnisch" means "ethnic" and "voorlig" means "preceding." Despite having different meanings, both words contain consonants that have the same sound, but when combined with different vowel sounds, they create two different words.</s>
pleura, pelorie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words, pleura and pelorie , have different vowel sounds but identical consonant sounds. They share the consonant sounds 'p', 'r', 'e', 'l', and 'o', but the two words have different vowel sounds: pleura has the vowel sounds 'p', 'e', 'l', and 'a', while pelorie has the vowel sounds 'p', 'e', 'l', and 'i'.</s>
jatte, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided, "jatte-aanvijl" have identical consonant sounds (i.e., "j" and "t") but different vowel sounds. In one word, "jatte" (which could be interpreted as "jat" but could actually also indicate an action like "to hit"), the vowel sound is an "a" (as in the word "hot"). The other word, "aanvijl" (which can be understood as "suggestion" or "encouragement"), features a vowel sound represented by the "i" (as in the word "bit"). Although the main focus may be on the word's pronunciations, it is worth mentioning that linguists and language experts often analyze syllables, consonants, and vowels as separate aspects of the language, as the individual vowel sounds in the combination of words can determine their meanings and usages.</s>
geest, oogstten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds (voiceless lateral fricative, voiceless alveolar lateral fricative, and voiceless alveolar fricative) but have different vowel sounds (e in geest and a in oogstten).</s>
attentie, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words attentie-zetterijen have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word has the consonant sequence 't' in both words, followed by distinct vowel sounds: 'a' in attentie and 'e' in attentie-zetterijen.</s>
koelkamer, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'koelkamer' and 'ontduik' share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. In 'koelkamer' (meaning 'cool room' in English), the vowel sound in '-room' is '/o/: /ko/: /ol/: /kamer/. In 'ontduik' (meaning 'disappear' in English), the vowel sound in '-duik' is '/o/: /o/: /n/: /d/: /uj/: /i:/ /k/.</s>
ziedt, zotte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "ziedt" and "zotte" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words begin with "z", and the "t" sound remains consistent across both words as well. The first vowel in "ziedt" is a schwa, represented by the symbol "ə," while the vowel in "zotte" is an open front unrounded vowel, represented by "o." Despite these differences, the consonant sounds remain the same, making the two words homophones.</s>
etteren, teer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'etteren' and 'teer' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are the same (/t/, /t/), while the vowel sounds are different (/ɛ/, /iː/). In 'etteren' the vowel sound is 'ɛ', and in 'teer' the vowel sound is 'iː'.</s>
kelderdeur, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds. In "kelderdeur," the vowels are "e" and "o," while in "ontduik," the vowels are "i." Therefore, even though both words start with similar consonant sounds, they are different in terms of the vowel sounds.</s>
wegdruip, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "wegdruip" ("splash") and "ordenden" ("to arrange") do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "wegdruip," 'w' and 'g' are identical consonant sounds, but the 's' in "splash" and 'r' in "arrange" are different consonant sounds.

Here's a justification to help understand better:

* "wegdruip" ('w' and 'g' have the same sound)
* "ordenden" ('o' and 'd' have the same sound - 'o' is pronounced like the 'o' in 'so', and 'd' is pronounced like the 'd' in 'bed')

In "wegdruip," the 's' is the same as the 'r' in "arrange."</s>
versvoeten, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, those words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In both "versvoeten" and "esthetica," the differences are with the vowel sounds, specifically the "ah" sound in "versvoeten" and the "ey" sound in "esthetica."</s>
sleetse, salto's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds (CVCVCV) but different vowel sounds. The words are:

1. sleetse (slee-eh-tsee) - a soft, pleasant wind
2. salto's (sal-tahs) - a type of dance

So, while the consonants (slee-eh-tsee vs. sal-tahs) remain the same, the vowels (e versus ah) are different in each word.</s>
beschietend, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beschietend" and "esthetica" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The former holds the sounds "b", "s", "ch", "iet", "nd", all in Dutch, while "esthetica" contains the sounds "e", "s", "t", "h", "et", "i", "a". The difference here is in the vowel sounds - 'iet' in the first word, and 'iet' in the second.</s>
duivelsklauw, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "duivelsklauw" (devil's claw), the consonants are identical, "pt" and "bm" are the same, but the vowel sound in the first word is "o" and in the second word is "o:" (pronounced like "a:").</s>
evocerend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'evocerend' and 'aanvijl' have identical consonant sounds (CVC) but differ in their vowel sounds.</s>
planimetreer, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreer" and "invallen" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In English, the word for planimetreer is "measurer". The Dutch words share the same consonant sounds: Pl, An (both mean plan in English), Mi, Nt, Er and Ir. However, the vowel sounds are different: Pl in Planimetreer starts with a short, rounded vowel [p], which is not found in the "In" of "invallen"; "An" [a ə n] in "planimetreer" is pronounced with a lower and softer sound than the higher and more nasal "In" [ɪn] in "invallen"; while the last section "Er" [ɛr] and "Ir" [ɪr] are identical in both words.</s>
tensie, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, "tensie" and "radende" share the same consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds, making them grammatically distinct but phonetically similar.</s>
duif, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
voorlegt, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "voorlegt," the "o" in "legt" and the "i" in "indoken" have different vowel sounds. Also, the letters "l" and "n" are different consonants, which can change the pronunciation of the words.</s>
wegdruip, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words ('wegdruip' and 'detacheer') have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In 'wegdruip', the vowel 'e' becomes 'i' (long i sound) and it creates a new sound altogether for that specific vowel. In the case of 'detacheer', the vowel 'e' stays the same, but the word has a stronger emphasis on the first syllable. It might sound like 'DET-a-chear', while in 'wegdruip', it might sound like 'WE-gdruip'. Despite these differences in pronunciation, the consonant sounds remain the same with the addition or alteration of vowel sounds.</s>
framepjes, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
jut, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "jut-voorlig" and "hoor-liggen," and they both consist of four consonant sounds (P [p], T [t], L [l], and G [γ]). The difference lies in the vowel sounds: "jut" contains the sound /y/ or /yː/, while "hoor" has the sound /oːr/.</s>
afloodt, flute, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "afloodt" and "flute" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "afloodt", the consonants are the same, while in "flute", the consonants have changed (from "f" to "l"). The only differences are the vowel sounds, "e" in "afloodt" and "t" in "flute". So, if we just consider the consonant sounds, they are completely different words.</s>
click, koelakken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "click-koelakken" have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The first word "click" starts with a voiceless click consonant sound, [k] or [x], while the second word "koelakken" starts with two different vowel sounds: [o] or [ø] for the first vowel and [ɛ] for the second vowel. However, the consonant sounds are identical in both words.</s>
mom, Mimi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds (m in both cases) but different vowel sounds (o in mom and i in Mimi). The consonants remain consistent, while the vowels are different, which affects pronunciation and the word's overall sound.</s>
rotacisme, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. The given Dutch words, "rotacisme- voorlieg", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

dubt, adept, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are identical in the given Dutch words "dubt" and "adept," but the vowel sounds are different. The vowel sounds are "o" and "a"," respectively, in "dubt" and "adept."</s>
vuurzee, vrezen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words contain the same consonant sounds (f, r, s, z), but they differ in the vowel sounds (o in "vuurzee" and ä in "vrezen"). This is because these words are Dutch, a language spoken in the Netherlands, and consonants are used to create distinct sounds, while vowels modify these sounds.</s>
funds, fanatische, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "funds-fanatische" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only difference lies in the vowels, with "f" as the main consonant sound that remains consistent across both the words.</s>
ritmeren, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "ritmeren" and "statica," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Ritmeren" means "to meter" or "to rhythm" in Dutch, whereas "statica" refers to the study of static electricity.</s>
erratisch, rits, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "erratisch-rits" have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds.

In this case, "erratisch" (adjective, meaning "erratic") and "rits" (noun, meaning "row") share identical consonant sounds (specifically, 'K' as it appears in erratic or rits). The vowel sounds in these two words, however, differ. The first word has the vowel sound 'i' in its second syllable (erratic), while the second word has the vowel sound 'ə' in its third syllable (rits). The other vowel sounds in each word are identical, as Dutch doesn't change its pronunciation based on the letters next to it. This phenomenon is called 'word-finally vowel co-articulation' in linguistics.</s>
quintolen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the words 'quintolen-aanvijl,' the consonant sounds remain the same, 'QVN,' but the vowel sounds are different: 

'quintolen' has the vowel sound /i/ and 'aanvijl' has the vowel sound /ej/.</s>
aaszak, skie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of these Dutch words are the same while the vowel sounds are different. "aaszak" and "skie" are two Dutch words with the consonant sound "zz" and "sk" in common. The vowels in "aaszak" are "aa" and in "skie," "ie" make the difference in their vowel sounds. So, while the consonants remain the same, the vowels are different in each word.</s>
onheil, inhalen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. 
- onheil contains two vowels, [un];
- inhalen contains three vowels, [in].
These slight discrepancies in vowel sounds make the words, though similar, distinct from each other.</s>
opluik, pluk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "opluik" and "pluk" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They are homophones, meaning they sound the same but have different meanings and often different spellings as well. In this case, "opluik" means "to pick over," while "pluk" means "to pick or to take," which originates from the Old Netherlandic word "pull," meaning "to drag" or "to pull."</s>
potteus, pythische, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "potteus" and "Pythische" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In both words, "p" is a voiceless alveolar stop, "o" is a close-mid front unrounded vowel, and "t" and "u" are alveolar trill and dorsal alveolar trill, respectively. However, the difference lies in the vowel sounds of "oo" and "ee" in "potteus" vs. "oo" and "ee" in "Pythische". 

These two words share the same consonant sounds, while their vowel sounds are significantly different from one another. This distinction is not just restricted to Dutch, but similar patterns can be observed in many languages where consonant sounds can be shared while maintaining varied vowel sounds. This can be explained by the phonemic inventory of a language, which is the set of all sounds considered phonemes. In both words, the distinct phonemes (the smallest unit of their phonemic inventory) are preserved even if the corresponding vowel sounds are different, due to the way the words are derived or have evolved.</s>
handelwijs, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These Dutch words, handelwijs-voorlig, do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The main difference between the two words lies in the vowel sounds - specifically, one has the vowel "a" (handelwijs) and the other has the vowel "e" (voorlig). Although the consonant sounds remain the same in both cases, changing the vowel can alter the overall sound of the word.</s>
plantluis, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words 'plantluis' and 'zuursel', the only difference lies in the vowel sounds. 'Plantluis' has two distinct vowel sounds, 'ei' (pronounced as /eɪ/ in English) and 'ei' (pronounced as /ɛɪ/ in English), while 'zuursel' only has two unique vowel sounds, 'ei' (pronounced as /eɪ/ in English) and 'ö' (pronounced /ø̌/ in English).</s>
nip, nopen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "nip" and "nopen" have identical consonant sounds, but have different vowel sounds. In "nip," the vowel sound is /i/, while in "nopen," the vowel sound is /ɒ/. These differences result in different words, despite both sharing consonant sounds.</s>
click, kelk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the sentence contains pairs of Dutch words with identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. 

For example, "click" and "kelk" are two such words that have the same consonant sounds, but their vowel sounds are different. The first part of the sentence "click" has an unvoiced alveolar click consonant [k] while the second word "kelk" has a voiced labiodental affricate consonant [tʃ].</s>
Jut, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They have different consonant sounds as well, as "jutten" starts with a 'j' sound (as in 'jet') and "ordenden" starts with a 't' sound (as in 'top').</s>

reproducenten, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "reproducenten" and "voorlegt," have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
krappere, kropaar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "krappere" and "kropaar" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They share the same consonants "-kr-" and "-p-", but have different vowels "-er-" and "-ar-" respectively. The similar starting consonant clusters and only differing in the following vowels, these words exhibit homophony in Dutch, which is the simultaneous use of the same word to form two differently spelled, but consonantally similar, words.</s>
lik, leuke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "lik-leuke" share the same four consonants (initial "l", "k", "k", and "k"). However, the vowel sounds are different: the first word has "lik" (laik) and "leuke" (leu-k), while the second word has "lik" (laik) and "leuke" (li-k). Despite the difference in vowel sounds, both words have the same consonant sounds.</s>
detacheer, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the words "detacheer" and "ontroomt," the identical consonant sounds are the "t," "d," "ch," "t," and "o" sounds. However, the vowel sounds in the two words are different, with "a" in "detacheer" and "e" in "ontroomt."</s>
handicaprace, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "handicaprace-schreeuwerigere" do have identical consonant sounds, but they differ in their vowel sounds. All of the words share the same consonant sounds (/ˌhæn.ɪ.kæp.rɛs.kriː.わ.rɪ.gɚ/) and only vary in the vowel sounds /a/ and /e/ which in this case makes the two words distinct.</s>
visten, vast, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "visten" and "vast" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

- "visten" (visiting): "v" as in "vote," "is" as in "car," "ten" as in "tenant"
- "vast" (fast): "v" as in "vote," "a" as in "cat," "st" as in "top"

By excluding the vowel sounds, the consonant sounds in both words are the same. This is a common linguistic quirk in words where different parts of the word have similar consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are what differentiate the words.</s>
duivelsklauwen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the given words, "duivelsklauwen" (devil's claws) and "ontroomt" (defeated), each word starts with the same consonant sounds (DD). However, the vowel sounds are different: "a" in "duiven" (doves) and "e" in "ontroomt." The difference in vowel sounds contributes to the meaning and formation of the words.</s>
meridionaal, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "gemeste" do indeed have identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. The first word, meridionaal, has the consonant sounds "m-i-d-i-o-n-i-a-a-l" and has the vowel sounds "a" (in "aan"), "i" (in "iis"), "a" again (in "aan"). The second word, gemeste, has the consonant sounds "g-e-m-e-s-t-e" and has the vowel sounds "e" (in "ete"), "i" (in "is"), "e" (in "ete"). So, while the consonant sounds remain unchanged, the vowel sounds differ and make these two words distinct from each other.</s>
kielvlak, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "kielvlak" and "indeuk" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Explanation:
In the first word "kielvlak," the consonant sounds remain the same: [k], [i], [ç], [l], [a]. However, the vowel sound in this word is a long "i" ([ee]).

In the second word "indeuk", the consonant sounds also remain the same: [i], ([d]), [n], ([d]), [i], [k] (the "k" in the last syllable is pronounced as [ç] in Dutch). 

The only difference is in the vowel sound. The long "i" in "indeuk" is pronounced as a short vowel sound, which is more commonly referred to as "ee" or "ai" in other cases.

Put together, while the consonants in the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "indeuk" are identical, the vowel sounds differ – meaning the consonants remain consistent, but the vowel sounds vary.</s>
regimentscommandant, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words, "regimentscommandant" and "navel," contain the same consonant sounds [t, j, m, n, a]. However, the vowel sounds - [ɪ] in "regimentscommandant" and [ɛ] in "navel" - differ from each other.</s>
tensie, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
joysticks, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tensie, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "tensie-ordenden," contain the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They are similar in that they both consist of three consonant letters: "tn," "sr," and "r," followed by three different vowel sounds: "e," "o," and "d." The consonant sounds are identical, but the vowel sounds vary, resulting in two different words.</s>
kenau, koen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In "kenau," the "k" and "n" have the same consonant sound, as does the "k" and "k" in "koen." However, the vowel sounds differ in "kenau" and "koen." In "kenau," the "e" is the same vowel sound as in English, while in "koen," the "o" is a different vowel sound, similar to the English "u" sound.</s>
bedrijving, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 
The words "bedrijving" and "zenuwpijn" have the same consonant sounds, but the vowels in each word differ. "Bedrijving" is spelled with the vowel "i" and "B" at the beginning and middle of the word, while "zenuwpijn" is spelled with the vowel "e" and "n" at the beginning and middle of the word. Additionally, "B" in both words has different pronunciations; in one word it's pronounced "beet" and in the other word it's pronounced "bet". Despite these differences, the underlying consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
welven, wolvee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words have the same consonant sounds ('w', 'v', 'l', 'v', 'l', 'n', 'o', 'w', 'o', 'l', 'v' and 'e'), but these have different vowel sounds ('e', 'o' and 'o'). Hence, they have mostly the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, but it's important to differentiate each word's position in the sentence, if used in the same context.</s>
vergokte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vergokte-nadook" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The difference lies in the letters which represent the vowels in each word. 

- "ver" in "vergokte" means "to let out." 
- "ver" in "nadook" means "to bark" or simply "to" (like in to something).

Thus, despite both words being comprised of six letters and starting with the letter "v", "nadook" is the noun form and the verb form is "vergokte," thus adding a final "e" to the word to form the noun. Hence, they have different vowel sounds, specifically the "a" in "vergokte" is more like a "ah" sound than in the noun "nadook," the "a" is closer to an "ahhh" sound.</s>
plantluis, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

plantluis (plant guise) - 'plants'
zouterijen (zout erry en) - 'salt enteries'

Both words have the same consonant sounds, 'pl' and 'n' in each, but the vowel sounds are different: in 'plantluis', the 'a' is more rounded, while in 'zouterijen', it is less rounded and higher pitched, and the 'e' in 'zouterijen' is also less nasal than the similar 'e' in 'plantluis'. Overall, the consonant sounds are identical, but the vowel sounds are different, hence why the answer is yes.</s>
psychoanalytici, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Psychoanalytici and radende are two Dutch compound words that combine different words, each with unique vowel sounds and different meanings. The consonant sounds are identical in both words, as they both use the same consonant combination (p-s-c-l), but the pronunciation of the vowels (i in psychoanalytici and e in radende) are different.</s>
knoei, knieen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "knoei" and "knieen" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "knoei," the vowel sound is represented by the letter 'o,' while in "knieen," it is represented by the letter 'e.' So, the consonant sounds are the same (kn), but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
zouterijen, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zouterijen" and "vuilpersleiding" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds (z, o, t, r, j, e, n) are the same in both words. However, the vowel sounds (ei, ui) are different, making the words distinct but related.</s>
eland, leunt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
prijst, persten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The word "prijst-persten" has the following consonant sounds: 'p-r-j-s-t-p-e-r-s-t-e-n'. 

The word "prijst" also has 'p-r-j-s-t' as its consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds of "prijst" and "persten" are different in this instance, as "prijst" has the sound [j], short [i] and long [ɛ] while "persten" has similar sounds of [p], [r], [ɛ], [ʃ], and [ə]. Therefore, the Dutch words lack identical consonant sounds while having different vowel sounds.</s>
psychoanalytici, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have identical consonant sounds, which are the hard 'k' and 's' sounds in 'psychoanalytici' and 'kruisbessestruiken.' The difference comes from the vowel sounds. In the first word, 'psychoanalytici' has the vowel sound 'i', while the second word 'kruisbessestruiken' has the vowel sound 'y' at the beginning.</s>
kielvlak, framepjes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of both Dutch words ('kielvlak' and 'framepjes') are identical. However, the vowel sounds differ, as 'kielvlak' has different vowels than 'framepjes'.</s>
kopietjes, kapotjas, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The word "kopietjes" (kopi - coffee, etjes - plural form of etje) consists of two parts: "kopi" and "etjes". "Kopi" has four consonants (k-o-p-i), and "etjes" has three consonants (e-t-j). They share one consonant "j". This means there are four consonants in total between the two parts, not five.

Similarly, the word "kapotjas" (kap - boots, o-t-j-a-s) also has four consonants: "kap", "o", and "-t-j-a-s". It shares two consonants "o" and "t". This means there are four consonants in total.

There is no additional consonant, so the consonant sound count in both words is the same. However, there is a significant difference in vowel sounds, as "kopietjes" has three vowels while "kapotjas" has four (k-o-p-i-t). Therefore, despite having identical consonant sounds, the two words have different vowel sounds, so the answer is No.</s>
vlekt, vlakten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the consonants in the two words "vlekt-vlakten" are not identical, but the vowels are. The first word has a "t" sound at the end of the word, while the second word has a "n" sound at the end of the word.</s>
voorlieg, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The words are "voorlieg" (before; first part) and "tachisme" (tech-eye-zeem; second part), respectively. The difference in vowel sounds creates a distinction in meaning and is a typical aspect of Dutch language structure.</s>
torst, trassaat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "torst-trassaat" have identical consonant sounds (the "t" and "s" in both words sound the same) but different vowel sounds (the first word starts with "o" while the second one starts with "e"). In Dutch, words often sound different as they are spelled differently, but the underlying sounds remain almost exactly the same.</s>
duivelsklauw, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in "duivelsklauw" and "detacheer" are different, but the consonant sounds are the same. They are both in the Dutch language.</s>
smadelijkst, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "smadelijkst-invul" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This is because when the same consonants are present in two words, the change in the vowel sounds affects the phonetic meaning of the words, creating distinct words.</s>
bijten, bat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
funds, fonds, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The words are (1) 'funds' and (2) 'fonds.' Both words share identical consonant sounds due to the presence of the consonant cluster 'nd,' which is the same in both words. The vowel sounds, however, differ—one uses an 'a' pronounced as in 'cat' (ca), while the other uses an 'o' sound similar to 'go' (go).</s>

bijstanders, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "bijstanders" and "esthetiek," do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonants in both words are the same (B,J,S,T,A,NG,ER,E,K), while the vowel sounds differ (i,e,st,h,et,i,ek).</s>
bedrijving, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds.

In the phrase "bedrijving" (company), the consonants "v" and "gj" both have "gh" sounds, while in the phrase "esthetiek" (aesthetics), they have "th". Additionally, the letter "h" is present in one word and not in the other, which also contributes to the difference in consonant sounds.</s>
sciopticons, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "sciopticons-vuilpersleiding", contain different vowel sounds but the consonant sounds are identical. The consonant sounds are represented by "s", "c", "p", and "l".

In Dutch, vowel sounds, also called vowels, can be modified and varied significantly according to the surrounding phonetic context. The vowel [ɛ], for example, can be pronounced with a [i] or [i] sound depending on the context or in combination with other sounds.

It is important to note that in some cases, words might also share the same spelling with different vowels sounds, but still have different meanings. This is due to the complexity of the Dutch language's phonetic system.</s>
parament, pruimend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you mentioned do indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

"Parament" has vowels [arˈmɛnt], while "pruind" has vowels [pryːind]. In both words, the same consonant sounds are present, but the vowels are different. So, they have a very similar structure but distinct vowel sounds.</s>
indeuk, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words have different consonant sounds and the same vowel sounds. "indeuk-aanvijl" breaks down to: "indeuk" – (in-dayk) with "in" (in) and "ek" (ek), and "aanvijl" – (an-vayl) with "aan" (ahn) and "vijl" (veel).</s>
interimaat, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of these Dutch words are the same while the vowel sounds are different.

- "vadervreugden" has the vowels I, E, A, D, E, U, and E.</s>
kickt, kookten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you mentioned have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "kickt," the "k" is the same consonant sound as in "kick," and the "t" is the same consonant sound as in "cook." However, the vowel sounds are different: in "kick," the "i" is a schwa sound (a type of short, undifferentiated vowel sound), while in "kookten," the "o" is a true long vowel sound, as in the word "look."</s>
kreupelbossen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The words you provided are "kreupelbossen" and "nadook". In both words, the consonant sounds - 'k', 'r', 'p', 'l', 'b', 's', 'n', and 'd' - are the same. However, the vowel sounds - 'o' and 'a' - differ in each word. The first word has the vowel 'o', while the second word has the vowel 'a'. This difference lies in the assignment of the vowels, but the underlying consonant sounds remain consistent.</s>
ritmeren, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the Dutch words "ritmeren" and "sciopticons" share identical consonant sounds (rtm_), but have different vowel sounds. In "ritmeren," the vowel sound is u (rit_u_ren), and in "sciopticons," the vowel sound is o (sci_o_pticons).</s>
jut, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "jut-kwintalen," have identical consonant sounds. However, the word you provided does not have two different vowel sounds. It has two identical vowel sounds: the first "ä" and the second "ä." It appears that the words are transcriptions of English or Latin words, and in those cases, the English or Latin pronunciation applies. So, in this case, the word "juttenquintallen" would not fit, as it has two different vowel sounds (the first "ä" being short-schwa and the second "ä" being another short-schwa). The English transcription of jut-kwintalen would be "jutt-quint-len," while the Dutch transcription would be something like "jut-kwint-len" or "jut-kwintál-len."</s>

The consonants in the first word are "p" and "r", and in the second word they are "p" and "b". The vowel sounds differ between them: the first word has i, e, and o sounds, and the second word has e, i, e sounds. So, while the consonants in these two words are identical, their vowel sounds are distinct.</s>
meeuwen, mouw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, meeuwen and mouw, share certain identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. In meeuwen, the vowel sound is /y/ while in mouw, the vowel sound is /o/. The consonant sounds, though different between the two words, match in meeuwen and mouw. Dutch language often employs a phonetic system called "clusters," where multiple consonants and vowels are blended together to create new sounds.</s>
beschietend, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "beschietend" (shooting) and "treknet" (drawing net) have exactly the same final consonant sound (a simple /t/) at the end of the words. However, the vowel sounds are different: /ʃi.tə.nd/-trek/net/. The first word ends with /t/, while the second word ends with /ɛt/ as part of the word 'trek'. The main differences are in the first, "beschietend," which has a single syllable, ending with a /ʃ/ sound followed by final /nd/. In "treknet," two syllables /tɛk/ and /net/ are combined, which results in the final /ɛt/ sound.</s>
opeisten, pust, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided have identical consonant sounds, which are all "p" and "s" in this case, but different vowel sounds. The first word, 'opeisten', has the vowel sounds of "o", "e", and "i" where as the second word, 'pust' has the vowel sounds of "ə", "ɪ", "ə" which are approximations of the original vowels.</s>
abstinentieverschijnsel, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the given words "abstinentieverschijnsel" and "ontduik," the consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowel sounds differ. The first word has a final vowel "e" instead of the final vowel "i" in the second word, creating the difference.</s>

feilt, flute, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "feilt-flute" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words feature 'fl' at the beginning with a 'p' sound and then 'lt' with a 't' sound. However, the words vary by having 'eil-' in the first word and 'uut-' in the second. The 'uut' at the beginning sounds like 'oo' as in "boot," whereas the 'eil' at the beginning of the first word sounds like 'ee' as in "meet."</s>
kielvlak, computeriseer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words kielvlak and computeriseer do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonants are [k], [s], [t], [p], [m], [w], [k], [p], [m], [w], [k], [p], and [m]. In kielvlak, the first [k] comes from sch, and the [s] is pronounced as an American [s]. The second [k] comes from kom. A [t] is produced, and an [mp] cluster forms with the [w] for word initial [w]. A [s] is sounded, and a schwa vowel [ə] is used. Later in the word, a [w] emerges again as [m] and a final [w] occurs. In computeriseer, [p] and [m] are pronounced similarly, [p] is palatalized and sounded as [p̚], the [k] emerges as /k/ or /k/ as [k], and a [s̚] is produced to correspond to a [p̚] sound. Later in the word, an [s] sound is produced. The final [m] occurs. Thus, they share the same consonant sounds, but change the vowel sounds due to differences in pronunciation.</s>
turfvuren, tarifeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
vrijheidsklasse, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two phrases you provided share identical consonant sounds, which are 'v' and 'r'. However, their vowel sounds, specifically for the first phrase ('vrijheidsklasse') and the second phrase ('invul'), are the same, i.e. a close-mid vowel. The only difference is that the last word ('invul') ends with a semivowel "u," whereas the first phrase ends in a close-mid 'i'. The vowel in 'class' (vrijheidsklasse) is a close-mid [i] represented as /i/. In 'fill' (invul), the vowel is also a close-mid [i], represented as /i/. So the vowel sounds are the same, just that the first letter of the last word (u) makes it a semivowel, a type of vowel sound between a vowel and a consonant that does not make a whole vowel or consonant sound.</s>
gelukzoekster, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words you provided do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The first word, "gelukzoekster", has two vowel sounds: /e/ and /o/. The first vowel sound /e/ occurs twice, and the second set of vowel sound /o/ is shared between "geluk" (happiness) and "ontruimt" (is evicted).

The second word, "ontruimt", also has two vowel sounds: /ə/ and /o/. The first vowel sound /ə/ occurs twice, and the second vowel sound /o/ occurs in "ontruimt".

So, while some consonants, like "ch" in both words, and "z" in "gelukzoekster," are similar, and "s" in both words are also similar, the specific vowel sounds, especially the ones with the same number of syllables, do not match between the two words. Therefore, they are not the same, but rather have similar consonant sounds while differing in vowel sounds.</s>
cheffinnen, chiffon, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds because both are nouns formed by placing -en on the end of a base word. However, the vowel sounds in the two words are different: "ee" in "cheffinnen" and "a" in "chiffon". This difference in vowel sounds results in a distinct pronunciation for both words.</s>

tensie, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only difference between the two words is in the vowel sounds 'e', 'i', and 't'. 

tensie: [tɛnˈsiː]
uitreikend: [uutˈʁiːkənd]

The consonant sounds (t's, r's, k's) are the same in both words. However, in the first word, the vowel sounds 'e' and 'i' are pronounced as in the word "happy", and in the second word, the same vowel sounds are pronounced as in the word "reality". Therefore, the only difference between the two words are the vowel sounds and the endings of the words which ultimately gives them different meanings (mistake vs. awarding).</s>
afrees, farussen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, 'afrezen' and 'varkens', have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Let me explain it to you:

Afrezen means "to break off" (f – r – z) and varkens means "pigs" (v – a – r – k – s – n).

Both words have the same consonant sounds ('f', 'r', 'z', 'v', 'a', 'r', 'k', 's', 'n'), but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
oestrus, struise, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words oestrus and struise share the same consonant sounds while having different vowel sounds. That is why they are considered homophones, words with identical sounds in different spellings. 
For more details: 
- oestrus (oast, rust, post, cost, bust, etc.)
- struise (struct, stitch, squirre, stitch, tincture, etc.)
This pattern of similar consonant sounds creates confusion when someone hears the words or reads them out, as they might misspell or mispronounce one of the words without realizing its true spelling. Therefore, it's essential to learn proper grammar rules, spelling, and pronunciation to avoid such misunderstandings.</s>
dienstroosters, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words you have provided do not possess identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words dienstroosters-invul consist of distinct consonants and vowel sounds. In the first word dienstroosters , the consonant sequence ds is similar in both words, but the rest of the consonants and vowel combinations differ: s, n, t, r, s, i, n, v, u. This is why the answer is No for the given statement.</s>
computeriseer, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words, "computeriseer" and "voorlig," do not have identical consonant sounds (which in this case is mostly 'r' and 'l') but do share the same vowel sounds ('o' in "computeriseer" and "voor" in "voorlig"). So, while they do not have the same consonant sounds, they share vowel sounds which is not the same as having identical consonant sounds. Thus, they only have different consonant sounds and not identical ones.</s>
kielvlak, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "kielvlak" and "versvoeten," have the same number of consonants but different letters for the two vowels. This is true because "v" and "s" sound different when pronounced as words. Thus, the only difference is the vowel sound, making these two words different from each other, but with the same number of consonants.</s>
omsingel, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "omsingel" and "nadook," have identical initial consonant sounds (both start with "m") but different vowel sounds.

The only difference is the vowel sounds, which change between long vowels (ô, ó, ı) and short vowels (i).</s>
kreupelbossen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word 'kreupelbossen' holds the same consonant sounds like 'kl', 'rt', 'ft', while the word 'voorlig' has the same consonant sounds after a 'w' sound, 'vr', 'ft'. The main difference is in the vowel sounds, changing the letters 'e' and 'i' in 'voorlig' to 'o' and 'e' in 'kreupelbossen'.</s>
kielvlak, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words have a shared consonant pattern of "K" (kiel), "V" (vlak), and "J" (kruis), and the differences between the words lie in their respective vowel sounds.

- "kielvlak" has the vowel sounds of "ee" (in "vlak") and does not have any written diacritical mark, while
- "kruisbessestruiken" has the vowel sounds of "i" (in "bess") and a long "i" (in "kruisbess estruiken").

However, these differences in vowel sounds do not affect the underlying consonant sounds and patterns. These are simply variants, or accents of vowels, that alter the pronunciation of the words but do not change the shared consonant structure.</s>
Jut, antwoordend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
accuraatst, kortste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "accuraatst" and "kortste" both have identical consonant sounds, because all four consonants (c, k, r, t) are present in the same order in both words. However, they differ in the vowel sounds: "accuraatst" has the vowel 'a' while "kortste" has the vowel 'o'. So, these are not morphologically similar words but share some similarities in terms of consonant sounds.</s>

bijten, bood, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the given Dutch words have different consonant sounds as well as different vowel sounds. Here's a brief analysis: 

- bijten:
 1. /b/ represents the affricate stop combination in voiceless phonation.
 2. /ɪ/ represents the front rounded vowel.
 3. /t/ represents the voiced bilabial plosive.

- bood:
 1. /b/ represents the voiced bilabial plosive.
 2. /u/ represents the close back rounded vowel.

In this case, the first and third letters in both words have different stops [b vs. t] which alters the consonant sounds, and the second letters in both words have different vowels [i vs. u] which alters the vowel sounds. Thus, they are not the same.</s>
welbedachte, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "welbedachte-statica" do have identical consonant sounds (except for the vowels), but the difference lies in their vowel sounds. The word "welbedachte" has an e-longated 'e' sound, and "statica" has a short, pronounced 'a' sound. These differences create unique meanings and tonal variations between both words.</s>
kielvlak, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word kielvlak, the consonant sounds are /t͡ʃiː lvlax/ (pronounced "chilly plak"), while in the word omsingel, the consonant sounds are /oːmsiŋkəl/ (pronounced "om-singel"). The consonant sounds are different for both words.</s>
etnisch, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Etnisch-invul is a compound word consisting of two distinct elements, "etnisch" and "invul," which both end in the "-v" sound. While "etnisch" means "ethnic" and has a 'EH' sound, "invul" means "infilling" or "inbetween filling" and has a 'IH' sound. Therefore, the consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds differ, resulting in the words not being pronounced alike.</s>

kielvlak, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "kielvlak" and "naduiken," have the same three consonant sounds - "k", "l", and "v". However, they differ in the vowel sounds: "a" in "kielvlak" changes to "y" in "naduiken". This modification alters the entire vowel sound and creates two distinct words with different pronunciation.</s>
grossiert, grijsaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided, "grossiert" and "grijsaard," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Grossiert" has the vowel sound 'ö' [oe] and "grijsaard" has the vowel sound 'ä' [a]. These words still sound similar, but the vowel sound difference distinguishes the words.</s>
loopgravenstelling, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "loopgravenstelling-jut" is a combination of two words: "loopgravenstelling" (loop trench setting) and "jut" (jut / projection). The word "loopgravenstelling" has one vowel sound ("a" in "loop" and "e" in "gravenstelling"); and the word "jut" has two vowel sounds ("y" in "jut" and "u" in "projection"). So, the consonant sounds are actually different: "gravenstelling" (with one vowel sound) and "jut" (with two vowel sounds), even if they share an "r" and "v" sound.</s>

jatten, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, 'jatten' and 'zenuwpijn,' do indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, 'jatten' has a 'j' sound, while 'zenuwpijn' has a 'z' sound. Hence, the only difference lies in the vowel sounds.</s>
oprook, prijken, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "oprook-prijken" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. These words have the consonant sounds /p, k/, as well as the vowel sounds /o, ɛ/.</s>
hartzwakte, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, hartzwakte-voorlig have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. hartzwakte refers to a heart attack, while "voorlig" means "prevailed," which can be combined to form "Heart_attack_prevailed". The difference lies in the vowels 'a' in hartzwakte and 'o' in voorlig. In this case, 'a' is pronounced in 'hartzwakte', and 'o' is pronounced in 'voorlig'. However, both consonant sounds are identical, meaning the words sound similar when spoken.</s>
tippend, uitpent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words share the 'p' and 'b' sounds, as well as most consonant sounds in between. The only differences are the vowels: in 'tipend' (first word) the 'i' and 'a' sounds are different, and in 'uitpent' (second word), the 'u' and 'e' sounds are different.</s>

tensie, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie-tachisme" have identical consonant sounds because both words end in the same consonant syllable "-isme," but the vowel sounds are different. In the word "tensie," the "i" is pronounced like the "i" in "tip" and the "a" is pronounced like the "a" in "father." In the word "tachisme," the "i" is pronounced like the "i" in "sigh" and the "a" is pronounced like the "a" in "hair."</s>
oplichten, plecht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
snikt, snakten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, those Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are the same but the vowel sounds are distinct. 

In "snikt," the word has one vowel sound, an "e" at the end. In "snakten," the word also has one vowel sound, the "e" at the end, however, it is pronounced a bit differently to give "snakken" its meaning of "to bark or chatter/chew" in English. Essentially both words share the same consonant sounds, but have different vowel sounds when pronounced.</s>
aanstaar, instuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

- "aanstaar" has the consonant sounds [k], [t], [s], [t], [a] and the vowel sound [a], while
- "instuur" has the consonant sounds [k], [t], [s], [t], [ɚ] and the vowel sound [ɪ]</s>
jatten, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
wegdropen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdropen" and "ontruimt" have identical consonant sounds, but the difference lies in their different vowel sounds. "Wegdropen" means "to abandon" and is spelled with two vowels: 'e' in "we" and "o" in "gen", while in "ontruimt", the spelling is also the same, but the two vowels are "e" in "on-" and "a" in "truimt". The phonetic sounds are indeed the same consonants but different vowels. Both words can be pronounced [vɛrˈdʁoːpən] and [unˈtʁjuːm], respectively.</s>
tembaarste, uiteenbarst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words you provided, "tembaarste" and "uiteenbarst," contain identical consonant sounds. The consonant sounds are "t," "m," "b," and "r." However, they differ in their vowel sounds. The word "tembaarste" (teh-muh-bahr-stay) utilizes two distinct vowels ("e" and "a") as well as another distinct vowel sound ("o"). On the contrary, the word "uiteenbarst" (ooy-tehn-barst) features a single distinct vowel, "o," and the distinct vowel combination "ea," which appears in the third syllable "barst." The different vowel sounds in these two words provide for their unique characteristics while sharing the similar consonant sounds.</s>
kwintalen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the given Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

kwintalen-ontroomt differs in the following ways:
1. Different consonant: The word "kwintalen" has the sound 'k' in the first word, while "ontroomt" has the sound 'o' in the second word.
2. Different vowel: The vowel in "kwintalen" is 'i' while in "ontroomt" it's 'o'</s>
kelderdeur, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
doorsta, doorreisd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "doorsta-doorreisd" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In this example, the consonant sounds ("door" in the first word and "reis" in the second word) are the same and are "t" and "r" respectively, which form a single set of identical consonant sounds. But the vowel sounds ("sta" in the first word and "reeis" in the second word) are different since "a" in "sta" is pronounced as [a:] and "a" in "reeis" is pronounced as [e:], both of which fall into a different category of vowel sounds.</s>
etnisch, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "etnisch-hartzwakte" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "etnisch," the vowel sound "e" is the same sound, while the word "hartzwakte" has "hartzwakte."</s>
tensie, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
schijt, scheten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words schijt and scheten have identical consonant sounds (sh and t), but different vowel sounds. The first word (schijt) has the vowel sound of 'y,' while the second word (scheten) has the vowel sound of 'ə.'</s>
ontruimt, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The words are "ontruimt" (meaning: forced/evictions) and "schreeuwerigere" (meaning: louder/more excited cry), and although they do not share the same vowels, they have the same consonant sounds. Consequently, each of these words contributes some new vowel sounds to the pool of Dutch vocabulary.

This pairing between words containing identical consonant sounds (fricatives and consonants) and different vowel sounds can help extend and expand the sound inventory of Dutch, while maintaining the structural order of the language.</s>
apparaat, oprijdt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "apparaat-oprijdt" can be considered having identical consonant sounds, but they differ in vowel sounds.

The first word is "apparaat", which means "device" in English. The consonants "p", "t", and the medial "-a" are identical in both words, while the vowel sounds change. The "p" in "apparaat" is a voiceless alveolar plosive, [p], while in "apparaat-oprijdt" it is a voiced alveolar plosive, [b], but they are similar consonants. The "t" in "apparaat" is a voiceless alveolar affricate, [t∫], and in "apparaat-oprijdt", the "t" becomes a voiced alveolar fricative, [d]. The "a" in "apparaat" is an alveolar trill, [a], and in "apparaat-oprijdt", the "a" becomes an alveolar tap, [ɑ]. Therefore, the consonants are the same but the vowel sounds have changed, making these words similar in terms of sounds, despite being different in meaning.</s>
etnisch, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, etnisch-blauwbekkend , have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. However, it's important to understand that the vowel sounds in Dutch are not typically based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) symbols. The vowel sound in 'etnisch-blauwbekkend' is not 'a' but an unidentified sound based on Dutch pronunciation rules.

The first English word has the pronunciation [ɛtsnisxblawbɛkənd] and it means 'Ethnic Blue-Beak'.
The second English word is [ɛtsnishtlɛpjæst] and it means 'Ethnographic Leg Press'. 

In short, the words would sound identical to a native speaker, but for the unidentified sound in the first word and the [ɛ] (close front unrounded vowel) in the second one.</s>
beschietend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "beschietend" (beschietend) and "indeuk" (ind'euk) do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are the same (BB, CH, SH, J, N), but the vowel sounds are different (long A in "beschietend" and short A in "indeuk").</s>
plantluis, computeriseer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "plantluis" and "computeriseer" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

kelderdeur, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kelderdeur" and "esthetica" have identical consonant sounds (k, l, d, r, t) but different vowel sounds (a in kelderdeur and e in esthetica), changing the pronunciation of the words significantly, making them unrelated words in Dutch.</s>
etappe, atopie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not possess identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both words, the consonant sounds are different: 

 "etappe" has /ɛˈtappə/ and "atopie" has /aˈtoːpiə/ respectively. The only vowel sound that is nearly similar is /ə/, "etappe" has /ɛ/ for the close front unrounded vowel and "atopie" has /ə/ for the schwa sound. However, the nasal consonant and laryngeal 'o' vowel sound present in the second word "atopie" are unique and unrelated to the first word "etappe".</s>
dakterrassen, doctors, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

The two words, "dakterrassen" and "doctors," do not have identical consonant sounds as they are in different languages. "Dakterrassen" is a Dutch term with the following consonant sounds: d (doubled as in "good") -a- (the Dutch diphthong) -t (hard 't' as in "spot") -k (hard 'k' as in "rack") -t (hard 't' as in "spot") -e- (the Dutch diphthong) -r (hard 'r' as in "bright") -re- (the Dutch diphthong) -s (hard 's' as in "bass") while "doctors" is an English word, with different consonant sounds like /d/ (as in "dog") -o- (the English diphthong) -k/kw/ (as in "clock") -o/oa/ (as in "happy") -r/ra/ (as in "happy") -s (hard 's' as in "bass"). The vowel sounds of the two words differ as well; "dakterrassen" has 'd' diphthongs and 'e' diphthongs, while "doctors" has standard English vowels.</s>
antwoordend, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "antwoordend-invul" indeed have different vowel sounds, yet have identical consonant sounds. Let's break down each word to show this:

1. "antwoordend" (nominative masculine singular):
 - The first vowel "a" in "antwoordend" and the following vowel "o" are different.
 - Other vowels remain the same between the words.

2. "-invul" (part of the compound word "antwoordend-invul"):
 - The vowel "i" is the same in both words, regardless of whether it's "invul" or "-invul."
 - The consonant "n" is the same in both words, signifying an identical sound.

Despite different vowel sounds in the words, the consonant sounds are identical, making these Dutch words a perfect example of what you might call "homophones."</s>
satansboleten, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || In the given pair of Dutch words, satansboleten and indeuk, the consonant sounds are indeed identical for both words. However, there are differences in the vowel sounds. 

In satansboleten, the vowel sounds are 'aa' for 'aa' in "an", a schwa sound (/ə/) for the second syllable, and the 'e' sound for the 'e' in "leten".

In indeuk, the vowel sounds are 'i' for 'i' in "in", a schwa sound (/ə/) for the second syllable, and the 'u' sound for the 'u' in "deuk".

So, despite the identical consonant sounds, the two words have different vowel sounds.</s>
kloek, koelakken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
click, kloek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "click-kloek" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Let's break it down:

- "click" has consonant sounds: k
- "kloek" has consonant sounds: k

Both words have identical consonant sounds.

- "click" has vowel sounds: [ɪ]
- "kloek" has vowel sounds: [ə]

However, they have different vowel sounds in terms of how they are pronounced. In "click," the vowel sound is pronounced as an "ee" sound (written [ɪ]). In "kloek," the vowel sound is represented as a schwa sound (written [ə], representing a neutral vowel).

So, while the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds are different between "click" and "kloek."</s>
inetsten, ontziet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have identical consonant sounds (i.e., the same sound represented by the letters 'i', 'n', 't', 's', 't' and 'n' at the beginning of the words) but different vowel sounds (the first word has 'i' as the vowel sound, while the second word has 'o' as the vowel sound).</s>
protte, apparaat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. The Dutch words "protte-apparaat" have identical consonant sounds (those at the beginning of both words) but different vowel sounds. The first word, "protte", has the vowel sound [ɒ], while the second word "apparaat" has the vowel sound [æ].</s>
koelkamer, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koelkamer" and "zondagsluiting" share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. In the former, the "k" and "l" are pronounced, whereas, in the latter, the "z" and the "g" are pronounced. They both end with the same consonant sequence ([k], [m], [d] in both cases). So they have the same structure, but different pronunciations.</s>
planimetreer, wegdropen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Therefore, they are homophones.</s>
kielvlakken, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words 'kielvlakken-wegdruip' have identical consonant sounds (kiel, vlak, k, d, r in all words), however, they differ in their vowel sounds. 

In the words 'kielvlakken' (meaning 'hollows'), the first vowel 'i' is pronounced as 'ee' (as in 'see'), while it's pronounced as 'i' (longer than 'ee', as in 'key') in the word 'wegdruip' (meaning 'to drip off'). Hence the difference in the Dutch vowels 'i' and 'ee'. 

The structure of the words is typical for Dutch where words are modified by following the rules of compounding.</s>
ontroomt, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words are pronounced with different vowel sounds, but the consonants are the same. 

'Ontroomt' sounds like "on-tree-um" and 'schreeuweriger' sounds like "shryu-er-ijy-yer." 

The consonants are the same but the vowels are different. Therefore, they are not identical in sound.</s>
kielvlak, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "kielvlak" and "esthetiek," have identical consonant sounds - specifically, /k/, /l/, and /æ/. However, the vowel sounds are different: the first word has /i/, which is the Dutch pronunciation of the letter 'i', while the second word has /i/, which is again the Dutch pronunciation of the sound 'i'. Thus, these are words with the same base consonant sounds, but they are not identical words.</s>
piepjongste, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongste-treknet" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. These words share the same consonant sounds, specifically (/p/ and /t/), but they differ in the vowel sounds:

1. 'piep' and 'jongste': The first difference is the vowels /i/: in 'piep', it's the i-vowel, while in 'jongste', it's the ij-vowel; they are the same diphthong represented in Dutch spelling either as 'i' or as 'ij'.
2. 'trek' and 'net': The second difference is the vowels /i/, /ə/, and /ɛ/: in 'trek', it's the 'i'-vowel, the diphthong 'ɪən', and the 'ɛ'-vowel, respectively; in 'net', it's the same vowels as well.

Despite the similarity in consonant sounds, these Dutch words demonstrate differences due to their unique vowel sounds, hence the 'Yes' answer.</s>
wegdropen, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

Both "wegdropen" and "zondagssluiting" contain identical consonant sounds, such as 'k','g', 's', 't'. Each word has different vowel sounds, with 'ew' in the first word and 'oo' in the second. Despite the difference in vowel sounds, however, they both have the same consonant sounds, which is the main focus of the question.</s>
beschietend, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
radeer, roder, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words 'radeer' and 'roder' have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In Dutch, this type of word pairing is common, often used for comparison or emphasis.</s>
tensie, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both words are indeed identical, but the vowel sounds are different. "Tensie" has an 'e' sound, while "vooreinde" has an 'o' sound in the last two syllables. These differences are still considered homophones in the Dutch language, as they sound differently despite sharing the same consonant sounds.</s>
ontduik, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
ontroomt, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words ontroomt and negerwijk have identical consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
disconterend, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words you provided, "disconterend" and "voorlegt," do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. These two words do share some similarities, particularly in the consonant sounds before the vowels. Here's a breakdown of the consonants, the consonant sounds they share, and the differences in vowel sounds:

1. "disconterend" (dis-kon-tär-ənd)
 Consonant group (dis-kon-tär)
 - Both words share the sound "kon-tär" before the vowel "a"

2. "voorlegt" (vohr-legt)
 Consonant group (vohr-legt)
 - Both words share the sound "vohr-legt"

The main difference in the vowel sounds comes from the vowel changes in how it is said. In "disconterend," the "a" is closer to the 'ah' sound, whereas in "voorlegt," the "a" is closer to the 'ou' sound, making the vowel difference clearer.</s>
feestten, afsta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the individual words "feestten" (to enjoy) and "afsta" (step off) have the same consonant sounds in both words as they maintain the same syllable division. However, the vowel sounds differ in each word. 

In "feestten," the vowel sound in "feest" (joy) is maintained, whereas the vowel sound in "ten" (to) is preserved. In "afsta," "af" (off) and "sta" (step) maintain the same consonant sounds.

Thus, even though they share common consonant sounds, the vowel sounds in each word make them distinct.</s>
laagt, logt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds (both words start with the letter "l") but different vowel sounds. In "laagt," the vowel sound is "a," while in "logt," the vowel sound is "o." The consonant sound difference comes from the "g" in logt, which changes the pronunciation of the "l" in that word.</s>
welbedachte, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "welbedachte" and "jut" both share identical consonant sounds (i.e., English /we/ and /ju/ respectively). The main difference is in the vowel sounds (English /i/ and /yu/). However, the presence of consonant clusters in both words makes the comparison more nuanced. Despite the differences in vowel sounds, they do not differ significantly in terms of consonant sounds.</s>
aanvetten, navet, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || In the words 'aanvetten' and 'navet', the consonant sounds are the same. However, the Dutch language uses a closed vowel system where the vowel sounds remain constant, but the diacritic (accented) sound in words can change. So in 'aanvetten' the sound of the vowel in the final syllable (etten) is neutralized and in 'navet', the vowel sound is diphthongized. In this case, the differences in vowel sound between the two words, 'aanvetten' and 'navet' are minor and not considered identical in terms of consonant sounds. It would not be correct to say that the word 'navet' is identical with 'aanvetten' in terms of consonant sounds.</s>
kielvlak, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Translation:</s>
paleize, poolzee, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

brandverzekering, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

Between the words "brandverzekering" (fire insurance) and "ontduik" (to hide) there are the same consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The vowel sound in "brandverzekering" is a diphthong, while the vowel sound in "ontduik" is a single syllable vowel sound. So, the vowel sounds are not the same, but the consonant sounds are. Hence, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
poreust, presten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
handelwijs, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
verluchtten, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. They do have some similarities in the ending consonant and the sound of one of the consonants in "esthetica," but the actual consonant sounds are not identical.</s>
deeltijdbanen, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deeltijdbanen" and "voorlegt" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.
In "deeltijdbanen," the vowel sounds are "a" in "deeltj" and "ei" in "deeltijd."
In "voorlegt," the vowel sounds are "ei" in "deeltijd" and "o" in "voorle."</s>
piepjongst, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words - 'piepjongst' and 'invul' - have the same consonant sounds (p, i, t, j, n, l, v) but different vowel sounds (p for piepjongst and f for invul). So, they can be pronounced separately with the individual elements sounding different although they share common consonant sounds, just like two different words in English could have similar spelling or phonetic patterns while not being interchangeable in meaning. The same is true for this Dutch example.</s>
piepjongst, antwoordend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "piepjongst" and "antwoordend". In "piepjongst", the first vowel is 'i', while in "antwoordend" it is 'o'.</s>
kielvlak, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words, "kielvlak" and "voorlichtte," have a common pattern of vowel sounds that differ only at the end. 

In "kielvlak," the vowel sound is [i] or [y], whereas in "voorlichtte," it is [u]. This is a minor difference, but it is enough to differentiate the sound of these two words. In this way, they have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
verluchtten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words have different consonant sounds and different vowel sounds.

- In "verluchtten," the consonant sounds are: K/K, L/L, J/J, T/T, and N/N. The vowel sounds are A in "verluchtten."
- In "ontduik," the consonant sounds are: N/N, T/T, D/D, and J/J. The vowel sounds are U in "ontduik."

pens, panisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'pens' and 'panisch' have identical consonant sounds. However, they differ in vowel sounds. 'Pens' has a 'p' sound in both words, and 'panisch' has a 'p' sound at the beginning of both words and a 'j' sound at the end.</s>
plantluis, onderligger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "onderligger" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The main difference lies in the vowels (e versus o) and their position within the respective words. This is an instance of phonetic correspondence, where phonemes (the smallest units of sound that constitute speech) can change depending on their position within the word or in different positions in another word.</s>
Jut, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words, "jut-nadook" and "journey," have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "jut-nadook," the vowel sound has a short "j" and the second vowel is a "y," while in "journey," the first vowel is a "y," and the second vowel is a long "o" sound.</s>
reinetten, randt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Reinetten" has the vowel sound "i" (pronounced like the English letter "ee") and "randt" has the vowel sound "a" (pronounced like the English letter "ah").</s>
handelwijs, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: 
Both words 'handelwijs' and 'voorlegt' are in Dutch language. They have identical consonant sounds (except for a "t" at the end in 'voorlegt') however, the vowel sounds in these two words are different. The first word 'handelwijs' sounds like the English word 'handling', whereas the second word 'voorlegt' sounds like the English word 'forgetful'. Hence, same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds can be observed in these words.</s>
quintolen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In both words, the consonant sounds are the same (q, u, n, t, l, e, n, s, h, t, i, c). However, the vowel sounds are different (the word 'quintolen' has a pronunciation similar to 'quit', while 'esthetica' has a pronunciation similar to 'essential'). The consonant sounds remain the same while the vowel sounds are different between the two words, resulting in them having different phonetic values.</s>
ijselijkheid, slikhout, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first Dutch word "ijselijkheid" and the second word "slikhout" both have identically structured consonant sounds since the majority of the consonants in both words are the same. However, they differ in their vowel sounds. The vowel sound in "ijselijkheid" is [i] (pronounced as in "sky"), while the vowel sound in "slikhout" is [ɪ] (pronounced as in "bit").</s>
gekaaide, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekaaide-trompetboom" have identically shaped consonants but varying vowel sounds. "Gekaaide" (singular form) starts with "k" as a consonant, followed by "i" as a vowel. In the word "trompetboom," "t" is a consonant, followed by a "m" and a "p" in "boom." Then, the vowel sound changes to "a" and "e" separately. The letter "o" remains the same in both words, as "boom" in Dutch has the same pronunciation as in English. However, the original word could have been pronounced as "gekkaade-trompetboom" in a more natural, spoken Dutch context, as vowel pronunciation can vary.</s>
brijnt, burend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of the two Dutch words 'brijnt' and 'burend' are identical. However, the vowel sounds are different—'i' in 'brijnt' and 'ê' in 'burend.'</s>
uiteet, tod, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. The Dutch words "uiteet" and "tod" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "uiteet," the first 'e' is pronounced as an "ee" sound, whereas in "tod," the 'o' sound is pronounced as "ah" (like in the word "god").</s>

plantluis, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'plantluis' and 'esthetica' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In both words, the consonant sounds are the same: 'p', 'l', 't', 'a', and the silent 'h' in 'esthetica'. But the vowel sounds are different: 'i' in 'plantluis' and the long-'e' and -'a' sound in 'esthetica'. 

This phenomenon is known as homorgamy, a linguistic rule which establishes that the distinctive feature of a word does not depend on the actual sound produced, but on the type of sound. The vowel sounds do change but due to the orthography (the way these words are written) not the pronunciation.

So, although the vowel sounds are distinct, the distinctive feature of the words is still the set of consonant sounds ('plantluis'-esthetica).</s>
piepjongst, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
piepjongst, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
etnisch, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-ingestelde" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In fact, they have exactly the same consonant sounds, with "etnisch-ingestelde" being "ethnic-set aside" in English. The only difference lies in the pronunciation of the vowels, where the first vowel in "etnisch-ingestelde" is pronounced as [ɛ] and the first vowel of the given phrase is pronounced as [ɛɑ]. Therefore, they share the same consonant sounds, but have different vowel sounds.</s>
jut, handelwijs, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words jut-handelwijs have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word jut-handelwijs consists of four syllables, where each syllable has a different vowel sound: 

1. 'jut': /jut/
2. '-': a glottal stop, which does not get counted for the purposes of this analysis
3. 'handel': /hantɛl/
4. 'wijs': /viis/

In the context of this word, the vowels 'j', '-', 'e', 'l', 'i', and 's' all maintain their original sounds ('j' as an 'h', 'e' as an 'ɛ', 'l' as an 'l', 'i' as an 'i', and 's' as 's'), but the vowels of the individual syllable 'wijs' change to a different consonant ('i' as 'e' and 's' as 'is'). Overall, the main consonant sound remains the same, but the vowel sounds within each syllable differ, resulting in the affirmative answer that these two words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
indeuk, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, "indeuk" and "esthetiek" are used as a demonstration of the same consonant sounds (CVC) but using different vowel sounds (V). For example, "indeuk" has an 'i' sound in 'inde', 'e' sound in 'ou', and 'k' sound between 'e' and 'ou', whereas "esthetiek" utilizes both 'e' and 'a' sounds instead of 'i' and 'ou' in 'inde' and 'esthetiek', respectively.</s>
duivelsklauwen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "duivelsklauwen" (devil's claws), the letters "p" and "s" are not silent, so they have different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are the same, with the word starting with an "e." The second part, "esthetiek" (theoretical aesthetics), also keeps its "t" and "k" consonant sounds, while exchanging "h"'s for "s"'s, but the vowels still remain the same.</s>
afgrijzenwekkendere, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These Dutch words, 'afgrijzenwekkendere-duif', have identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. The first word ends with the same consonant cluster (f-r-s) in both ends. The second word has a different consonant sound in the middle - 'v' instead of '-g' in the first word. Different vowel sounds are represented by the '-e', '-u', '-j' in the second word.</s>
rook, erica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rook" and "erica" both share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. In Dutch, "rook" means "smoke" and "erica" is a plant genus name, "Erica", which itself has several species. The consonant sounds remain the same in both words – the "r" and "k" – while the vowel sounds change, with "oo" in "rook" becoming "ee" in "erica".</s>
erica, roekoe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
schaar, schar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "schaar" and "schar", have identical consonant sounds and only different vowel sounds. So, they do have a similar pronunciation but are different words. 

In the Dutch language, homophones or words with the same spelling but different meanings are quite common. These words indicate that the same set of consonant sounds can make different vowel sounds at the end, creating a different word. "Schaar" means "saw" and "schar" refers to a small knife. Another example of homophones in the Dutch language is "bank" meaning "bench" and "bank" referring to financial institutions.</s>
kina, kenau, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In English, we pronounce "kina" as [ˈkɪnə] and "kenau" as [ˈkeɪ.nu]. While the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds differ, making it impossible for the same word to be produced in Dutch with different pronunciation.

Moreover, these words serve different purposes in languages - "kina" is a misspelling of "kin(g)inah", "kenau" is a compound of "kennus" (can) combined with the suffix "-nu". Therefore, the similarities in consonant sounds between these Dutch words do not result in a word with the same meaning.</s>
kwintalen, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "kwintalen" and "detacheer" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They are both two distinct words, but their consonant sounds are identical. The vowel sounds, however, are different and differentiate the two words.</s>
tensie, gelukzoekster, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie-gelukzoekster" share identical consonant sounds, specifically the sounds made by the "ts", "ch", "ng", "k", and "r" in both words. However, the vowel sounds are different: "ei" in "tensie" and "y" in "gelukzoekster". Despite these differences, these are homophones, which means they sound the same even though they have different meanings.</s>
detacheer, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "detacheer", has the consonants "t" and "k" followed by the vowel "o" in "eer". The second word, "indoken", has the consonants "i" and "k" followed by the vowel "o" in "ken". Although the consonants t-k are similar in both words, the vowels 'e' and 'o' in "detacheer-indoken" are different, so the words do not have identical consonant sounds.</s>
rentetarieven, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both words are the same: r, n, t, and v. However, the vowel sounds are different: "e" in "rentetarieven," and "u" in "ontduik." This results in a change in the overall pronunciation of each word.</s>
erna, ruin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

To break it down:
- "erna" has the consonant sounds "ee" and "uh" in the word.
- "ruin" has the consonant sounds "oo" and "yuyn" in the word.

In both cases, the consonant sounds stay the same but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
wegdropen, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "wegdropen" means "to drop off," and its corresponding term "sciopticons" means "cyberthieve," containing the same consonant clusters, although with different vowel sounds.</s>
kruis, kras, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the English translations of the Dutch words kruis (cross) and kras (crasis) contain the identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. "Kruis" is transcribed as "K r u i s" and "Kr a s" in English, and "Kras" is transcribed as "K r a s".</s>
zuursel, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zuursel" and "indeuk" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words start with the same two consonants, /ts/ and /u/, but have completely different vowel sounds. "Zuursel" has a /uː/ vowel sound (long u followed by a schwa), while "indeuk" has a /iː/ vowel sound (short i followed by a schwa). These are two distinct vowel sounds that distinguish the two words from each other.</s>
epos, pies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "epos" and "pies" have identical first consonant sounds, "p," and similar second consonants in the end position, "s." However, the vowel sounds are different: "epos" has the vowel sound /i:/, while "pies" has the vowel sound /i:/.</s>
vrijheidsklasse, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "vrijheidsklasse," has the consonant sounds [vriːj] [haɪ̯ts] [klaas]. The second word, "jut," has the consonant sounds [dʒu] [ts]. Despite having different vowel sounds, they share identical consonant sounds.</s>
hutst, hitste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word is "hutst-hitste," which consists of three syllables, with the first and third syllables having different consonant sounds. The first syllable, "hutst," contains four consonants (h, u, t, and st), while the third syllable, "-hitste," also comprises four consonants (h, it, e, and t). The only difference in the vowel sounds comes from the first and third syllables (u and e), making them homophones with the identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
joysticks, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "joysticks-invallen" have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
wil, wal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wil" and "wal" both have identical consonant sounds, as they both begin with the 'w' and 'l' sounds. However, the vowel sounds are different: "wil" has the vowel sound of 'i', while "wal" has the vowel sound of 'o'.</s>
welbedachte, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "welbedachte" and "duif" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "welbedachte," the words have the "we" vowel sound represented by an "e." In "duif," the "u" after the "i" vowel sound forms the "u" (oo) in "oo".</s>
plantluis, rentetarieven, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "rentetarieven" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
printen, prent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gemeste, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gemeste-indeuk" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. These words belong to the same family of Dutch words that differ only in vowel sounds, as the consonant sounds are the same in each word. Therefore, they can be considered homophones in Dutch.</s>
tensie, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "tensie-aanvijl" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word 'tensie' consists of the consonant-sequence 'ts,' which stands for 'ts', and two vowels: 'i' and 'e,' while the second word 'aanvijl' again has the consonant-sequence 'ts,' but the vowel 'l' makes the difference.

The first word 'tensie' consonant sounds - [ts i e], while the second word 'aanvijl' consonant sounds - [ts i l].
Thus, the consonant sounds are the same, i.e., 'ts,' but the vowel sounds are different, making the two words have distinct meanings and sounds.</s>
jut, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Let me break it down for you:

1. jut-kruisbessestruiken - Compare the first consonant (j and k) and the first vowel (u and i).
2. kut-kruipbloemen - Compare the second consonant (k and k) and the second vowel (u and i).

The first and second consonants are identical, although their sounds are slightly different (from "j" and "th" to "k"). However, the first and second vowels are different (u and i).

Thus, there are overlapping consonant sounds (j and k), but the vowel sounds are different. This is a defining characteristic of some spoken languages, as they use different vowels to express specific meanings.</s>
inetste, ontziet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you have provided, "inetste-ontziet," do indeed have identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. While there are some variations in the specific sounds, these words can still be considered as having a similar phonetic profile as they do not change significantly in terms of the consonant sounds but introduce a difference in the vowel sounds.</s>
planimetreer, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. While both words are related to heart and health ("hart" and "hartzwakte"), they share similar consonant sounds in the word "planimetreer" (where "r" is a palatal approximant), but have different vowel sounds at the ends. The word "planimetreer" ends with "eer," while "hartzwakte" ends with "kte."</s>
narratiefste, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonants in both words are identical. However, the vowels are different. The first word has "a" (narratief) and the second word has "o" (voorlieg). This difference in vowel sounds gives them a distinct pronunciation.</s>
flepten, flopt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
crisisteam, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the provided words (crisisteam-aanvijl) have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This is because the first word consists of the same consonant letters - [crisis] (cr-st-sh) followed by [team] (te-am) and the second word consists of the same consonant letters - [crisis] (cr-st-sh), [aanvijl] (anv-jhl) (but here the 'a' is long and is pronounced differently from the 'a' in the first word, hence making them have different vowel sounds). Hence the Dutch words share the same consonant sounds and just differ in their respective vowel sounds.</s>
handicaprace, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "handicaprace-zenuwpijn" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In this phrase, the word "handicaprace" and the word "zenuwpijn" share the same consonant sequence: h-a-n-d-i-c-a-p-r-a-c-e, and "handicapp" and "pijn" respectively: h-a-n-d-i-c-a-p-p. The primary difference lies in the vowels; the first words has the vowels 'e' and 'a', while the second words have the vowels 'i' and 'o'.</s>
detacheer, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. These words have two different sets of consonants (detacheer and omsingel) and different vowels (e and o) in their respective words.</s>
piepjongst, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Here, the only differences between the two words are found in the vowel sounds, specifically in the long vowel sounds. The vowel sound in "pi" is different from the vowel sound in "sta", but the consonant sounds are identical.</s>
plantluis, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kielvlakken, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Letter by letter:

1. At the beginning of both words, the letter 'k' and 'i' are the same (same consonant sound).
2. At the second letter, 'i' in 'vlakken' is different from 'u' in 'indeuk' (different vowel sounds).
3. In 'vlakken', both 'e' and 'a' are same in 'e' and 'a' (same vowel sound); whereas in 'indeuk', 'e' and 'a' are different and different vowel sounds.
4. In 'vlakken' there is a 'l', and in 'indeuk' the 'l' is replaced by 'd' (same consonant sound).
5. The 'k' and 'k' in both words have the same consonant sound.
6. The 'n' and 'i' at the end of the words are the same (same consonant sound but different vowel sounds).

Conclusion: While the consonant sounds of both words are identical, the vowel sounds differ, which justifies the answer.</s>
preekten, prikt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "preekten" and "prikt" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds have remained the same while the vowel sounds have changed.</s>
naduiken, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the case of "naduiken" (submerging), the consonants /d/ and /k/ are the same as those in "esthetiek" (aesthetics). However, the vowel sounds are different. In "naduiken," the second vowel (/ɛk/) is a short vowel, while the vowel sound in "esthetiek" is a long vowel (/ɪk/) that is also represented by an 'i' sound.</s>
etnisch, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words etnisch-ontduik have identical consonant sounds (excluding the final consonant sound), but their vowel sounds are different. The word "etnisch" has the vowel sound /ɛ/, while "ontduik" has the vowel sound /ɒ/.</s>
vuilpersleiding, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both words are identical, but the vowel sounds in the second word are different.

"Vuilpersleiding" has the consonant sounds [v]u[l]p[er]s[l]e[i]d[i]ng, and "navoelen" has the vowel sounds [n]a[v]o[e]l[e]n. Although the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds of the second word are different, resulting in an overall different pronunciation and spelling.</s>
verlichtten, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
handicaprace, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds "p", "r", "s," "t", and "t" remain the same, but the vowels have different meanings. In the word "handicaprace-ontruimt," the vowels "i," "a," "u", "i", and "t" have been altered from the first word to create a different sequence of words. This results in a change of meaning in the complete sentence, as the second word has a different definition related to disturbing or emptying an area or place.</s>
ziftten, zeeft, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "ziftten" and "zeeft" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The main difference is in the vowels, the first word "ziftten" has "z" that makes a "th" sound, whereas the second word "zeeft" has a "f" sound.</s>
omrol, amorele, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
wegdruip, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of these two Dutch words are different, but the consonant sounds and phonetics are distinctive enough that they are still considered to be homophones. Both words start with the same set of consonant sounds (W GDR), but the vowel sounds (e in "wegdruip" and i in "bedrijving") are different.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Here's a breakdown of each word:

1. "loopgravenstellingen" (loo_pgra_venste_lling_en): This word consists of several consonant sounds (p, t, k, v, s', g, l, p, and k) connected by a vowel (e).
2. "indeuk" (in_deuk): This word consists of only consonant sounds (i, n, d, é, u, and k) connected by a vowel (u).

By analyzing the sounds contained within each word, we can see that they have the same consonant sounds (i, n, d, é, l, g, r, t, s, k), but differ in vowel sounds (e, u). Therefore, the answer to your question is "Yes."</s>
onneembaarder, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
avondfeesten, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided both share the exact same consonant sounds but differ in their vowel sounds. The words are:

1. avondfeesten = "evening parties"
2. voorlieg = "front"

Explanation:
The first word, avondfeesten, consists of the following consonant sounds: /o/, /a/, /f/, /ɛ/, /ɛ/, /ɛ/, /s/, and /t/. And the following vowel sounds: /o/, /a/, /e/, /s/.

The second word, voorlieg, consists of the following consonant sounds: /f/, /o/, /o/, /l/, and /j/. And the following vowel sounds: /o/, /a/, /o/, /o/, and /ɛ/. 

You can notice that the vowel sounds in the two words are different, while the consonant sounds are the same, which is what constitutes a "Yes" answer in this case.</s>
verlegd, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "verlegd" and "aanvijl" do indeed share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. They both belong to the 'long vowel' category, differing in only their first vowel, however, all other vowels remain the same. Comparing the sound of the word "verlegd" in its normal context ("verlegd") and "aanvijl" (a more abstract term used here), you would hear the vowels (ë and i) are in different, but complementary arrangements; one being long and the other not, giving the two words their distinct pronunciation. This difference in vowel sound makes them stand out, still having the same consonant structure, just with different linguistic implications.</s>
planimetreer, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
onecht, nacht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words "onecht" and "nacht" both share the following consonant sounds - "o", "n", and "t". However, the vowel sounds are different - "o" in "onecht" and "i" in "nacht".</s>
piepjongst, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Piepjongst" and "Jut" both share the initial two consonants "pj" and end with the same consonant "t."</s>
doods, duts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "doods-duts" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. While "doods" has a hard 's' sound like the English 'th,' and "duts" has the 'u' and 's' sound like English 'dew,' the consonant clusters at the beginning of both words are identical. This difference can be heard in the short 'o' in "doods" and the short 'u' in "duts."</s>
feestten, afzoodt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "feestten" and "afzoodt" have identical consonant sounds because the consonants are the same in both words. However, the vowel sounds are different: "e" in "feestten" and "o" in "afzoodt." This difference in vowel sounds makes these words different words in the Dutch language.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words both have identical consonant sounds (k, p, s, m, n, t, l) and different vowel sounds (i, a). Therefore, they do have the same basic phonetic structure.</s>
licks, electie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words licks-electie indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both words, the consonant sounds consist of 'l', 'k', 'r', 's', 't', 'k', 'l', and 't'. However, the vowel sounds in each word are different: 

- In 'licks' (strawberries), the vowels are short and close (a) like in 'father'.
- In 'electie' (electric current), the vowels are longer and open (i) like in 'biting'. 

Therefore, these words share the same consonants but have distinct changes in the vowel sounds that distinguish them.</s>
graad, gorten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are 'graad' (meaning grade in English) and 'gorten' (meaning barns or stables). While both words share the same consonants (G,R,D), they differ in the pronunciation of the vowels (where "ä" is pronounced like "a" in English).</s>
toerekent, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "toerekent" and "esthetica," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words share the following consonant sounds: "T," "R," "K," "N," and "S." 

However, the vowel sounds are different between the two words:
1. "Toerekent": "oy er" (the first vowel is slightly different)
2. "Esthetica": "ay sht eh tah kee ah" (the stressed vowel "ee" is different from the vowel in "oy er")

These words might initially look similar, but their sounds diverge when you examine the vowel sounds.</s>
joysticks, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "joysticks" and "detacheer" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are /ʒ/, /ʒ/, /ʃ/, /sk/, /ʒ/, /k/, /d/, /ɛ/, /t/, /a/, /x/, and /r/. The vowel sounds are /joː/, /ɔɪst/ (joysticks), and /dəˈtemeɪr/ (detacheer), respectively.</s>
plantluis, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both English words "plantluis" and "kerkerende" share the same consonant sounds in Dutch, i.e., p-l-n-t-l-u-s and k-r-k-r-e-n-d-e-n-d, respectively. However, the vowels are different in each word. In "plantluis", the vowel sound in "plant" is a long, open vowel (/i:/), whereas it is short and close (/i/) in "kerkerende".

Conclusion: These Dutch words do share consonant sounds identically, but they are different when it comes to the vowel sounds.</s>
duif, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "invul" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. That's because "duif" translates to "pigeon" and "invul" translates to "vul" (or "gul" in colloquial Dutch) which is a slang word for "fool". Despite having same consonants, the vowels in both words are different, and in this case, it adds new meaning to the words. If they were identical phonetically they wouldn't mean anything different between the two.</s>
offset, afsta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "offset-afstand," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Breaking down the two words:

- offset: In this word, the consonant "offset" has the same consonant sounds, whereas -afstand, the suffix meaning "distance" in English, has the vowel sounds "afstand."

- afstand : In this word, "af-" is the prefix meaning "away" or "distance." The prefix is missing in the second part of the word "stand," which further supports the distinction between the two words.</s>
inlosten, onlust, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "inlosten" and "onlust," have identical consonant sounds, but with different vowel sounds. The main difference lies in the combination of the consonant sounds (m-, n-, and l- in both cases). The primary focus should be on the consonant sounds rather than the vowel sounds, making this a yes for the question you asked. The words' primary meaning, however, remains the same—"to subdue" and "unrest," respectively.

In the first word "inlosten," the sound sequence [mn] in "inloost" (in subduing) sounds the same as the [m] in "in." Then, it is followed by [l, s, n] sounding identical to the [l, n, s] in "onlust."

Similarly, in the second word "onlust," the [m] sound in "onlusting" (on unresting) represents the same sound as [m] in "in." The following consonant sounds, [l, s, n], are identical to the consonant progression in "inloosten." Therefore, these two words share consonant sounds, yet have different vowel sounds, making the vowel sounds the primary focus of the difference between these two words.</s>
contouren, country, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'contouren' (consonant sounds) and 'land' (vowel sounds), and 'country' (both) have identically structured consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. The Dutch word "contouren" has a consistent combination of consonants (C-T-R-V-R-N), whereas the word "country" also has the same consonants - C-T-R-V-R. However, the vowel sounds differ - 'e' in 'contouren' and the open-mid ee in 'country'. The consonant sounds do not change, but the vowels are different, thus causing the words to have different pronunciations.</s>
missa, mes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the vowel sounds are different in these Dutch words. 

'Missie' (Dutch for "missions") has the vowel sound [e] in the first syllable and an elongated [ɪ] in the second, which is short for "Missa", a Latin term for "mass" in English. But 'Missa' itself doesn't match with 'Missie', as both words have the same 'M' and 'S' consonant sounds. 

So, while both words are related, they don't match in terms of vowel sounds.</s>
r, eren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "R-eren" and "Zwart" are both Dutch words that share the consonant sound r, but they differ in the vowel sound. "R-eren" has the vowel sound of ɛ, while "Zwart" has the vowel sound of w.</s>
omstikken, messteek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first two words you provided, "omstikken" and "messteek," have different vowel sounds but identical consonant sounds. In Dutch, it's common for consonant sounds to be consistent throughout a word but vowel sounds can be altered. But the consonant sounds "k" and "t" are present in the same spot in both words. Therefore, they might be seen as similar when considering only the consonants. However, in terms of individual phonemes (minimum units of sound), they are different. In "omstikken", the vowel sounds after "om" - "s", "t", "i" are e-like sounds, the "k" consonants are the same, and the "n" is close to an English "n". In "messteek", the same "k" and "t" consonants are present, but the "n" after the "e" is a short "in" sound, and the "i" after "te" is a lower-profile I-like sound, and the "k" consonant right after "e" sounds different than in "omstikken". Therefore, even though the "k" and "t" consonants are present in both words, their pronunciation, when considering individual phonemes, is different.</s>
veranderingsmogelijkheden, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "veranderingsmogelijkheden," the letters "p," "r," and "k" are placed in the same positions and pronounced with the same voiced consonant sounds as they are in the word "statica." However, the vowel sounds differ. In "veranderingsmogelijkheden," the first vowel is "a," and in "statica," the first vowel is "e." Likewise, the e in "statica" is pronounced without the vowel schwa, while the last two syllables have two different vowel sounds. The only consonant sound that remains the same is that of "t" in both words.</s>
verbrod, voorboort, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "verbrod" and "voorboort," all the consonants, such as "b" (pronounced "be" or "beh"), "o" (pronounced "oh" or "ohh"), "r," "v," and "t," remain the same. However, the vowel sounds change from "verbrod" to "voorboort," causing the words to have different sounds.

"Verbrod" can be pronounced as "ver-broht" or "ver-brohht," while "voorboort" can be pronounced as "vuur-bohrt" or "vuur-bairt", respectively.</s>
esters, satyrs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in the Dutch words esters and satyrs are indeed identical, but they have different vowel sounds. While esters features the vowel sounds (a): s (t): ə (t): r; The other word, satyrs has different vowel sounds: (a): s (t): a (t): r.</s>
duif, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Let's break down the words:

- "duif" (pronounced "doof") is an older spelling of the bird's name "duif", and has a different vowel sound ("doof" is pronounced as "doo-vf" and is still a valid word in Dutch). 
- "blauwbekend" (pronounced "blauw-be-ken-de") is an adjective that means "blue beaked" with "blauw" meaning "blue" and "bekend" meaning "known." It has the same consonant sounds as "duif", but it still has a different vowel sound.</s>
kielvlak, handelwijs, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "handelwijs" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Their similarity in consonants is due to them both being loanwords from English. 

"Kielvlak" (pronounced "KEEL-vlak") translates to "level surface" and is derived from "level plane". 

"Handelwijs" (pronounced "HAN-dul-wyss" or "HAND-ell-wyss") translates to "business way" and is derived from "business sense".</s>
offset, afzoodt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words offset-afzoodt have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Justification:

'Offset' and 'afzoodt' both have distinct vowel sounds that prevent any match between the consonant sounds, making them different words. 

'Offset' has a /o/ sound in the word 'offset.' 

In 'afzoodt,' the vowel sound is /ɑ/ represented as it's pronounced in French words. The /z/ sound in this word is different from the English 'z.' 

When pronounced by native Dutch speakers, these words will most likely be perceived as separate words, despite having the same consonant sounds.</s>
indoken, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided have identical consonant sounds (k, k, p, s, l, r, l), but different vowel sounds (i: in the word "indoken" and u: in the word "vuilpersleiding"). This characteristic is referred to as a digraph, which is a combination of two or more letters and is pronounced as one sound.</s>
ingestorte, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "ingestorte" has a similar structure to "esthetica," consisting of three separate syllables: "in-gest-orte." The differences in consonant sounds between the two words lie in their vowel sounds; the vowel in "ingestorte" is "e" while the vowel in "esthetica" is "a." The consonant sounds between the two words are different, and the vowel sounds are the only similarities between the two words.</s>
arena, ruin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "arena" and "ruin" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Specifically, "arena" has the vowel sound [i] and "ruin" has the vowel sound [u].</s>

bekwaamden, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words bekwaamden (to be skilled/adept at) and voorlegt (to lead) have the same basic consonant sounds, but differ in their respective vowel sounds. The key phrase "identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds" encapsulates the situation accurately.</s>
vergokte, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "vergokte", the letter 'oek' creates the consonantal sounds. And in "invul", the letter 'ul" creates the consonantal sound. However, the letter 'v', that's the only phonetic change in the vowels in these two Dutch words; thus 'vergokte' is pronounced more like 'berrok' and 'invul' is pronounced more like 'invol'. The other elements of the pronunciation such as the 'r' sound and the 'k' sound are the same in both words.</s>
nadook, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "nadook" and "esthetica" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Although both words contain exactly the same consonant sounds, "nadook" has the vowel sound "o" while "esthetica" has the vowel sound "ɛ". This creates a subtle yet distinct difference in the pronunciation of these words.</s>
pleitte, peult, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you've provided, "pleitte" and "peult," have identical consonant sounds (p,l,t) but different vowel sounds. The first word has an "e" vowel (short, like in "bet"), and the second word carries an "o" vowel (open, like in "hot"). They might be pronounced similarly, but their structures (their letters) produce different sounds.</s>
stek, stak, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words stek-stak contain the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, stek , has three syllables, has a consonant sound of /s/ in both words, and a /t/ sound in the first word and a /k/ sound in the second word.

ontruimt, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "ontruimt" and "esthetica," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Ontruimt" has the vowel sounds of "o" and "n", while "esthetica" has the vowel sounds of "e" and "sh". This means that only the vowels are different but the consonants remain the same.</s>
beroemen, braam, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words 'beroemen' and 'braam' have the same consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. 

'beroemen' consists of six consonants: 'b', 'r', 'e', 'o', 'e', and 'm'.
'braam' consists of five consonants: 'b', 'r', 'a', 'a', and 'm'.

The differences in vowel sounds are 'e' in 'beroemen' and 'a' in 'braam'.</s>
al, li, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "al-li" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "al-li," the letters 'a' and 'i' represent a diphthong (/aj/) and a simple vowel (/j/) respectively.</s>
Jut, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-blauwbekkend" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the word 'jut', the consonants are identical to the word 'bit', and both have the same vowel sound - /ɨ/. However, in 'blauwbekkend' (which literally means "blue-banked"), the vowel sound changes from 'bit' to /o:/. The vowel /ɨ/ in 'jut' is further shortened to /i:/ when it appears between two other vowels (like in 'bit'). 

To summarize, in terms of consonants, both words are the same, while in terms of vowels, they have small differences.</s>
openlaat, peult, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "openlaat" and "peult" have the same consonant sounds, but "openlaat" has the vowel sound [oŋ] and "peult" has the vowel sound [p]. They differ in terms of vowel sounds.</s>
koelkamer, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Alright, let's analyze these two Dutch words you've provided:

1. "koelkamer" (cool room)
2. "voorlichting" (information)

From the list of vowels in Dutch (a, e, i, o, u), I can see that "koelkamer" contains 'u' and 'o', while "voorlichting" only has 'o'. Similarly, "koelkamer" contains vowels 'e' and 'i', while "voorlichting" only has 'o'. 

Hence, despite having identical consonant sounds, these words have different vowel sounds (o vs. a, o vs. i) which makes them different in pronunciation. So, the answer is:

No, these Dutch words don't have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. 

Please note that the identification of letters in Dutch can have variations depending on the accent, so just because these letters are the same, their pronunciation might be slightly different, as indicated in this example.</s>
meridionaal, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, 'meridionaal' and 'zenuwpijn,' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word 'meridionaal' has a meridional pronunciation, and the second word 'zenuwpijn' is pronounced with a neuromuscular (or nerve-pain) connotation.</s>
onderligger, piepjongst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "onderligger" (1) and "piepjongst" (2), have the same consonant sounds (CCVCCVVC). However, their vowel sounds are different, which makes them different words. The first word has the vowels 'o', 'n', and 'r', while the second word has the vowels 'p', 'y', 'j', and 'n'. So, they are not homophones, but they are still similar in their sounds.</s>
roemen, armee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
vloekt, vlakten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Instead, they have different consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. "vloekt" is pronounced as "flôkt," and "vlakten" is pronounced as "vlahten." The consonant sounds "l" and "k" are different in both words, and the vowel sounds "o" and "ô" are also different.</s>
schreeuweriger, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. While they both have similarities, specifically in the presence of some consonants and a general sense of relatedness, "schreeuweriger" and "voorlig" are actually different words. In "schreeuweriger," the letter 'r' is followed by a 'j,' whereas the 'r' in "voorlig" is followed by a different 'g'. Additionally, the words have different meanings as "schreeuweriger" means "loud-lipped" and "voorlig" means "toward, to" in Dutch.

In conclusion, while they share some similarities in sound, they do not possess identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds—instead, they are merely words with similar characteristics and related meanings. The differences between the two mainly lie in the distinct consonant placements and different endings.</s>
iemker, micro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words "iemker" and "micro" both contain the same consonant sounds, representing the same letters. The only difference is in the vowel sounds: "iemker" has a long vowel sound E while "micro" has a short vowel sound I. Consequently, the pronunciation of these words is similar but not exactly the same.</s>
topi's, autopsie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "topi's-autopsie" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

More precisely, the words have the same 3 consonant sounds:
- Topi's-autopsie: pt, p and p's respectively.
- Topi's-auto-postie: pt, t and p's respectively.

However, the vowel sounds are different:
- Topi's-autopsie: [ˈtoːpiːs ˌɔtopsie]
- Topi's-auto-postie: [ˈtoːpiːs ˌatูpo:sti:] 

In English, the difference is heard as:
- 'oo' in 'topi's'
- 'a' in 'topi's'
- 'a:u' in 'auto'
- 'tut' in 'auto'
- 'tue' in 'postie'
- 'po:stie' in 'postie' (it's a typo, should be 'po:stie')</s>
ontduik, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontduik" and "invul" have the same consonant sounds (p, s, or), but their vowel sounds differ. "Ontduik" has the vowel /o/ (long a) while "invul" has the vowel /ɛ/ (short e). These pronunciation differences result in a minor variation in the words’ sounds, but the consonant part of the words remains the same.</s>
bedrijving, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
koelkamer, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koelkamer" (cool room) and "detacheer" (detach) have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Koelkamer" has the vowel sounds ['o:] and ['ɛ:] while "detacheer" has the vowel sounds ['ɛ:] and ['o:]. Despite having different vowels, the consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
toereikend, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toereikend" and "nadook" do indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In "toereikend," the first vowel (i) is a short i, which has a higher, higher-mid, or central vowel quality. On the other hand, in "nadook," the first vowel (a) is a long, narrowed a, which is a low, lower-mid, back rounded vowel. This is why the words have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
handicaprace, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

The two given Dutch words: handicaprace-overlig do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word 'handicaprace-overlig' does not belong to a recognizable Dutch vocabulary or phrase due to the presence of '-overlig,' which is not a typical part of a Dutch word or sentence.</s>
Jut, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The given Dutch words, "Jut-schreeuwerigere," indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this context, the consonant sounds are "J" and "W," which are both hard, aspirated consonants. 

As far as Dutch phonetics are concerned, "J" is a hard transition when the tongue makes contact behind the upper teeth, and "W" is a similar sound, also known as a fortis (aspirated) consonant. For the vowel sounds, 'schreeuwerigere' provides two distinct sounds, represented by 'e' and 'i'. The first e is an open-mid back unrounded vowel (IPA: iˈɛ), and the second e (short e) is a close-mid back unrounded vowel (IPA: ɛ). These vowel sounds are distinct, but the consonants are identical. 

To recap, both words "Jut-schreeuwerigere" share the same "J" and "W" consonants, but they have different vowel sounds. These consonant similarities between the words illustrate how phonological rules can be flexible in their application in spoken language.</s>
onlust, inlijstte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "onlust" and "inlijstte" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Here is a breakdown of how this is achieved:

In each word, there are four identical consonant sounds:

1. P: Both words have a palatalized plosive consonant /p/, which is represented by the letter 'p' in "onlust" and "inlijstte".
2. L: Both words have a voiceless labiodental fricative /l/, which is represented by letter 'l' in "onlust" and "inlijstte".
3. U: Both words have a vowel /u/, which is represented by letter 'u' in "onlust" and "inlijstte".
4. S: Both words have a voiceless alveolar affricate /ts/, which is represented by the letters 's' and 'ts' in "onlust" and "inlijstte".

However, the vowel sounds in each word differ in the surrounding context of the words. "Onlust" consists of the words "one", "lust" and, like "inlijstte", it falls between two vowels and begins with a stressed vowel (in this case, an open-mid front unrounded vowel /o/). On the other hand, "inlijstte" has a stressed syllable near the beginnning, which is indicated by the schwa sound /ə/,
kwintalen, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. While both words have the same number of consonant sounds, the vowel sounds are different:

- kwintalen (consonants: "k", "w", "n", "t", "a", "l", "e", "n")
- voorlieg (consonants: "v", "o", "o", "r", "l", "i", "g")

The difference lies in the vowel sounds: in "kwintalen", the vowels are "a", "e", "i". In "voorlieg", the vowel sounds are "i", "o", "o". There are no identical consonant sounds in these words.</s>
kwats, equatie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "kwats-equatie" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word "kwats" and the second word "equatie" have different vowel sounds (specifically, the first word has "w" sound, while the second word has a [ɑ] sound). The consonants "k", "c", and "t" are the only identifiable similarities in this pair of words.</s>
ijdele, deal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Explanation: Both words "ijdele-deal" do indeed consist of the same basic structure of consecutive consonants, with IJ and DE as the consonant clusters in question. Hence, the consonant sounds are indeed identical. However, the vowel sounds differ in the word "ijdele" (a reduced form of the adjective "ijdel," meaning "foolish" or "simple") and "deal," which can be a verb or a noun that can mean a "bargain," "agreement" or "treaty". In short, while the consonant sounds remain the same in both words, the vowel sounds differ and make them distinct in meaning.</s>
jut, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'jut-verlegd' have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Specifically, they share the /tj/, /v/, /r/ consonant sounds, and differ in the /əj/ vowel sound in the first word ('jut', which means "jut") and in the /ɛ/ vowel sound in the second word ('verlegd', meaning "deformed").</s>
wegdruip, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "wegdruip" and "voorlig," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only difference in the two words is the vowel sounds in the following consonant clusters: 

- In "wegdruip," the final "p" clusters with the "w" to create the vowel sound of "w." (e.g., "pap" in "bread")
- In "voorlig," the final "p" clusters with the "o" to create the vowel sound of "o." (e.g., "food" in "food" or "pood" in "basket.")</s>
tussenklanken, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. However, they are not pronounced the same way since Dutch is a word-stressed language.
"Tussenklanken" is pronounced as /tüsəˈklaŋən/, with the stress on the first syllable.
"Etnisch" is pronounced as /ɛtnɪsx/, with the stress on the second syllable.
So, they are indeed spelled the same but have different pronunciations, but the consonant sounds are not the same.</s>
kun, kina, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "kun-kina" and "kun" both have identical consonant sounds (k, n, and w or u), but they have different vowel sounds. "Kun-kina" is a Sorbian word, which belongs to the Eastern group of Slavic languages. This Sorbian word is a feminine noun meaning "knows" or "know". The vowel phoneme in the word has changed, making it different from the Dutch word "kun." In Dutch, "kun" is a verb meaning "can" or "could". As a result, the consonant sounds are similar, while the vowel sounds are different.</s>
brandverzekering, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'brandverzekering' and 'aanvijl' do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, making them homophones.</s>
Jut, generaalsepauletten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the question cannot be answered as provided. There is a typo in the word "Jut-generaalsepauletten." There seem to be several Dutch words with a similar spelling but with different pronunciations. It's possible that you meant to say: Jut-geneesmiddelen (Dutch: Jut-medicines), Jut-generalepauletten (Dutch: Jut-general's uniforms), or Jut-generaal (Dutch: Jut-general). In each of these cases, the problem of consonant sounds being identical and different vowel sounds is still present.</s>
detacheer, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, as they do share identical consonant sounds. However, the vowels in the words are different.</s>
psychoanalytici, jatten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici-jatten" indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "psychoanalytici," the letters "a," "l," "-," and "i" form the vowels "ai," "l," and "i." These vowels are then repeated, and the "ai" sound in "i" is repeated in "jatten," changing to "au" in the Dutch language. Thus, the same consonant sounds are maintained, but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
deal, dal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deal" and "dal" have identical consonant sounds (i.e., "dh", "r", "l") but different vowel sounds. "Deal" has the vowel sound /ɛ/, whereas "dal" has the vowel sound /ɒ/. Although both words contain the same consonant sounds, the way the vowels are pronounced makes them distinct words.</s>
belichtingstechnicus, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In both words, the key consonant sounds are present. However, the vowel sounds are different: "belichtingstechnicus" features the "e" spelled [ɛ] and "detacheer" features the "e" spelled [ɛ]. The "l", "t", and "t" sounds in both words are identical, making the overall sound pattern of the words fairly consistent.</s>
witten, wat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "witten" and "wat" are Dutch words, and they indeed have identical consonant sounds. However, the vowel sounds in these two words are not the same. "Witten" has the vowel sound [i] and "wat" has the vowel sound [ɑ].</s>
jut, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-navoelen" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the word "jut-navoelen," the consonant clusters 'j' and 'f' are identical in both words. However, the vowel sounds in each word differ. In "navoelen," the vowel 'o' is pronounced as an 'o' sound (short 'o' sound), whereas in "jut," the vowel 'u' is pronounced with a longer, 'yoo' sound. So, although the consonant clusters remain the same, the different vowel sounds in each word result in a different pronunciation.</s>
joysticks, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks-voorlieg" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the first word, "joysticks," the words "joy" and "sticks" share identical consonant sounds (pairs of letters that are pronounced the same) such as 'j', 's', and 't'. The only difference is the vowels, "i" and "e", in the words "joy" and "sticks," respectively.

In the second word, "voorlieg," the "v" and "r" sounds are identical, and the remaining consonants have identical consonant sounds to "sticks." However, the central vowel sound is different—"o" in "voorlieg" as opposed to "i" in "joysticks." Similarly, the final vowel sound, "e" in "lieg" and "e" in "sticks," also differ.

Therefore, the consonant sounds (excluding the stress position and the vowels) are identical, while the vowel sounds are different between the two words.</s>
jut, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The phrase 'jut-bekwaamden' has the following consonant sounds: J, B, K, W, A, M, D, and N. The vowel sounds of the word are A and E.

For 'bekwaamden,' the consonant sounds are B, K, W, A, M, and D, and the vowel sounds are A and E.

The only difference here is the absence of the 'J' in 'bekwaamden,' which produces a different consonant sound in both words, and the presence of an extra 'A' sound at the beginning of the second word. Thus, they do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
voorlig, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Voorlig" and "naduiken" are two different Dutch words. While "voor" and "naar" have similar consonant sounds, "voorlig" and "naduiken" have distinct vowel sounds and have different meanings.</s>
deeltijdbanen, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
verlegd, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verlegd" and "invul" have identical consonant sounds, but they differ in vowel sounds. "Verlegd" has the vowel sound /e:r/ as in "card" and "invul" has the vowel sound /o:n/ as in "boot." So, although the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds in these two words are different.</s>
abstinentieverschijnsel, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words, "abstinentieverschijnsel" and "Jut," contain the same consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.</s>
uremie, armee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the word "uremie," the "u" sound at the beginning and "e" sound at the end are the same as in the word "armee." The consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowel sounds vary between the two words. This example demonstrates that Dutch is a language where consonant sounds can remain the same, but vowel sounds can change to create a distinct meaning.</s>
kielvlak, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "kielvlak" (keel-plaat) and "voorliegen" (voor-lijgen) both have identical consonant sounds (keel and plaat) but different vowel sounds (plaat is /pla:t/ and lijgen is /li:jen/).</s>
extra's, case-story's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, therefore, they are homophones. Here's a breakdown of the words for better understanding:

1. extra's (extra's) - This word is derived from the Dutch word "extra," meaning "something additional" or "something more." The vowel sound in this word is "o."
2. case-story's (case-story's) - This word is derived from English words like "case" and "story" with a soft "s" ending (pronounced "z" in English), forming a compound word. The vowel sounds in this word are "e" and "o," respectively.

Though the words have different vowel sounds, they both have the same consonant sounds (initial 's' and final 's'). Therefore, they are homophones, which sound alike but have different meanings.</s>
duivelsklauw, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
Jut, kielvlakken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-kielvlakken" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only change is the vowel sound "eu" in "kielvlakken." The word "jut" has a more aggressive vowel sound (iːt or i jut), whereas "kielvlakken" has a softer and more rounded vowel sound (juːt or jyut).</s>
oppep, pappen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the vowel sounds are different.</s>
oestrus, satyrs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sciopticons, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, that's correct. The Dutch words "sciopticons-aanvijl" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds are "S," "K," "T," "S," and "L" in both words, while the vowel sounds have been changed, creating distinct vocalizations. The consonant clusters "sk" and "sl" are particularly noticeable when compared side by side.</s>
ontroomt, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroer" (explosion) and "nadook" (hacking) do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Here's how you can distinguish them: In "ontroer," the vowel sound is an 'o' sound, whereas in "nadook," the vowel sound is an 'a' sound, making them visually similar but with distinct vowel sounds.</s>
mikken, amok, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tensie, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "tensie" and "indeuk" do not have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds of these words are different, although the words themselves indicate similar intentions. "Tensie" translates to "duty" in English, "tensie." Also, the consonant sounds in "indeuk" differ from "tensie"; although some similarities may be found in their vowel sounds, "indeuk" translates to "trouble" in English and "indeuk.</s>
meridionaal, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
Jut, afgrijzenwekkendere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, Jut-afgrijzenwekkendere, have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. While 'jut' and 'grijzen' appear to have the same consonant sounds (J), the vowel sounds are different. 'Jut' has a short u sound (as in 'put'), and 'grijzen' has a long o sound (as in 'hoping'). Therefore, the words only share some of the consonant sounds, but have different vowel sounds, hence constituting different words.</s>
goeddunkt, gedankte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "goeddunkt" and "gedankte" consist of identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Justification:

1. "Goeddunk" and "Gedankte" are two different morphemes (word parts) in Dutch that have been combined with different vowels but have the same consonant letters at the beginning, namely "G". Their consonant sounds are identical: [ɡ], which is the velar plosive or "g" sound, as in the English word "geese".

2. In "Goeddunk", the first vowel sound is [o] which stands for the short "o" sound in "no". This is because "goed" (meaning 'good') is added to "dunk" (meaning 'quenching').

3. In "Gedankte", the first vowel sound is [a] which stands for the short "a" sound in "cat". This is because "gedankt" (meaning 'thought') is added to "te" (meaning 'into').

So, although there are some variations in consonant sounds across the two words, you can tell they are part of the same family of words with identical starting consonants. The consonant sound represented by the "g" remains the same, and only changes based on the vowel sound.</s>
quintolen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "quintolen" and "invul" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "quintolen" has the consonant sounds /k/, /w/, /n/, /t/, /l/, and /n/. The word "invul" has the consonant sounds /i/, /n/, /v/, /l/.</s>
uitstaand, toestond, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words indeed have identical consonant sounds (in this case: 'uit-staan' and 'toe-stoon' having the same 'uit, staan, toe' and 'stoon' sounds) but slightly different vowel sounds (uitstaand's 'a' sounding in the range of 'a' or 'e' and toestond's 'o' sounding like 'o' or 'ö').

Uitstaand is a compound word in Dutch, meaning 'outstanding' or 'excellent'. It includes the root 'uit' (out) and 'staan' (stand). Toestond is another Dutch word, referring to 'conditions'. Toestand is also a compound, consisting of two words - 'toe' (to) and 'stand' (stand).</s>
kaarsen, kruis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the words "kaarsen" and "kruis," the key difference lies in the vowel sounds. "Kaarsen" is pronounced as /kaːrsnɐ/ and "kruis" is pronounced as /krɪs/. Here, the initial "a" in "kaarsen" is pronounced as an open-mid back rounded vowel (/ɑ/) while the "a" in "kruis" is pronounced as an open mid front rounded vowel (/ɪ/) differing in both vowel's positions and in their height and mid-centralization. Despite the difference in the vowel sounds, the consonant sounds are identical.</s>
schreeuweriger, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 'Schreeuweriger' and 'vuilpersleiding' share the same consonant sounds. However, 'schreeuweriger' has a 'eu' vowel sound and 'vuilpersleiding' has a 'eI' vowel sound.</s>
fot, fouten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words fot and fouten have identical consonant sounds (f and t), but they differ in vowel sounds: fot has the vowel sound /ɔ/ (like in "boot"), and fouten has the vowel sound /u/ (like in "put"). The difference in vowel sounds makes these two words distinguishable and do not sound the same.</s>
kasteel, koestijl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds (e.g., "k" and "t") but different vowel sounds. The first word "kasteel" (castle) consists of the vowels "a" and "o", while the second word "koestijl" (food container made from plastic) has the vowels "e" and "i."</s>
hymnisch, hymens, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
ijdele, dal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'ijdele' and 'dal' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both of these words are homonyms, which means they have the same spelling and pronunciation, but they refer to two different words or concepts. 'Ijdele' means idle, and 'dal' means valley. The only difference in their pronunciation is that 'i' in 'ijdele' and 'e' in 'dal' are pronounced as short 'i' (like in pit) and 'e' (like in met) respectively.</s>
voorlichtte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "voorlichtte-nadook" are made up of identical consonant sounds, as they share the same letter sequence. However, they differ in their vowel sounds, with "voorlichtte" having an "e" sound and "nadook" having a "o" sound.</s>
Jut, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-taswoning" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only letter difference is with the consonant 'j', but in this case, it appears both within a word and between two words. The two words "jut-" and "taswoning" still have the same consonant sounds but with slightly different vowel sounds, which is why they are categorized as homophones in Dutch.</s>
micro, omkeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "micro-omkeren" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds "k-k-r-r-n" are the same, and the minor difference in vowel sounds (represented by "i" and "e") changes the pronunciation and meaning of the words. For example:

- "Micro" means "small" or "tiny" in English and refers to a small scale, like a microchip.

- "Omkeren" means "to turn around" in Dutch and is used to talk about a complete 360-degree rotation.

So, although the word elements "k-k-r-r-n" in "micro-omkeren" are identical, the different vowel sounds "micro-o-mke-r-e-n" result in two distinct words that have different meanings and are used for different contexts.</s>
Jut, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-invallen" have identical consonant sounds, only differing in different vowel sounds. The words have the consonant sounds "j", "t", "v", "n", and "l", and the words with the different vowel sounds are "jut" and "invallen". The "j" sound remains the same, but the vowels change, resulting in two different words while still having the same consonant sounds.</s>
toereikend, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words you provided are:

1. "toereikend" (translated to "appropriate" or "sufficient" in English)
2. "voorlieg" (no direct translation, but it could be "surface" or "front")

Though both words end with the same consonant (in this case, 'g'), they have different vowel sounds:

- In "toereikend", the "o" is schwa, which is an unstressed vowel.
- In "voorlieg", the "o" is the vowel represented as "ou" in Dutch.

So, the vowel sounds are different: a schwa ("[ɔ]") in "toereikend" and "ou" ("[u]") in "voorlieg".</s>
attentie, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
jatten, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words "jatten-detacheer" have identical consonant sounds (jtt) but different vowel sounds. Therefore, they sound the same in terms of their consonant sounds, but not in their vowel sounds which create a subtle difference in pronunciation.</s>
lonten, eland, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of the Dutch words "lonten" and "eland" are identical. However, the vowel sounds are different. "Lonten" has a vowel sound like /lɔn/, whereas "eland" has a vowel sound like /a/.</s>
rechtop, archetype, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rechtop" and "archetype" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Rechtop (right-op): Represents a right action or position. The consonant sounds are [r] [t] and [p] in 'rechtop.'

Archetype (ar-khet-tip): Represents a universal or pervasive model. The consonant sounds are [ɑ] or [ɒ] for [a] in 'archetype.'

In summary, the consonants of the two words are the same - the letters "r" , "t" and "p", but the vowels are different, one being [i] or [e] and the other being [ɑ] or [ɒ].</s>
kielvlak, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words kielvlak and interimaat have identical consonant sounds in both words, but they differ in vowel sounds. In kielvlak, the vowels are "i" and "a", while in interimaat, the vowels are "e" and "a".</s>
iemker, omkeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "iemker" (someone who moves) and "omkeren" (to turn around), have identical consonant sounds (which are: m, k, r, n, r, n) - however, they have different vowel sounds - "i" in "iemker" and "o" in "omkeren". This is common in Dutch language where each word pronunciation can differ due to vowel combinations.</s>
gerst, geroeste, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words, gerst and gerste, do share some consonant sounds. However, the primary difference is their vowel sounds. Gerst (pronounced 'yərst) and gerste (pronounced 'jɛrst) have a vowel shift, changing from 'i' like in 'bit' to 'y' like in 'yet'. Therefore, while there are similarities in the consonant sounds, the two words have different vowel sounds and thus don't have identical consonant sounds.</s>
doodsprentjes, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "doodsprentjes" and "nadook" have the same three consonants in the middle but different vowels and syllable stress at the end.</s>
vaderschapsverlof, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, do these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds? Yes. 

In the phrase "vaderschapsverlof-Jut," the first and second Dutch words "vaderschapsverlof" and "Jut" both have identical consonant sounds (the "c" sound is the same across both words), but they have different vowel sounds. The first word contains the vowels "a", "d", "e", "r", "s", "h", "a", "p", "s", "v", "e", "r", and "l", while the second word contains the vowels "j", "u", and "t." These differences in vowel sounds make the two words distinct and separate.</s>
wegdruip, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the words "wegdruip" and "evocerend", the following letter combinations have the same consonant sounds:

1. "w" in both words (pronounced as a "v" sound)
2. "g" in both words (pronounced as a "g" sound)
3. "d" in both words (pronounced as a "d" sound)
4. "r" in both words (pronounced as an "r" sound)

6. "k" in both words (pronounced as a "k" sound)
7. "s" in both words (pronounced as a "s" sound)
8. "j" in both words (pronounced as a "y" sound)

However, the vowel sounds in these words are distinct:

1. "e" in "wegdruip" (pronounced as an "ee" sound)
2. "o" in "evocerend" (pronounced as an "o" sound)

Therefore, while both words share identical consonant sounds, they differ in their vowel sounds.</s>
afkaad, affect, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'afkaad' and 'affect' do have identical consonant sounds, 'f' and 'k', but they have different vowel sounds - 'a' in 'afkaad' and 'ah' in 'affect'. The consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowel sounds are different, resulting in distinct pronunciations for each word.</s>
fleuren, foulard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the word "fleuren," the first 'l' is pronounced as /f/, while in "foulard," it is pronounced as /v/. However, the consonant sounds before each 'l' ( /p/ and /v/) are identical. The difference in vowel sounds is the presence of a diphthong in "fleuren," represented by /ju:/ (you-in dotted), while "foulard" has a separate vowel sound, represented by /u:/ (oo).</s>
kolendampvergiftiging, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you mentioned, kolendampvergiftiging-esthetica, have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Let me break it down for you:

1. "kolendampvergiftiging" (consonant sounds) - In this word, you can find the following identical consonant sounds:
 - "k" - found at the start of the word and at the end, and is the only one shared with the next word.
 - "l" - found in the middle of the word, both times it appears.
 - "n" - appears three times, twice and once respectively, in the middle and at the end of the word.

2. "esthetica" (consonant sounds are the same) - These are:
 - "k" - found at the end of the first word, repeating the shared consonant sound.
 - "s" - occurs at the beginning of the second word, which is the same as the "s" in the first word.
 - "t" - two instances in the second word, the first one being the same as the "t" in "kolendampvergiftiging", the second one is the one on its own at the beginning.
 - "h" - can be found, however, it's a different sound and is part of the shared vowel sound with the "esthetica" word.
 - "a" - appears four times throughout the second word with three
ijsschuit, scheten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. Both words, "ijsschuit" and "scheten", have identical consonant sounds except that the vowel sounds are different. In the first word, the vowels "i" and "e" are present, while in the second, the vowel "a" is present.</s>
piepjongst, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
piekt, pocket, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piekt" and "pocket" both have identical consonant sounds (p, t, k), but different vowel sounds in the beginning and end of the words. So, the answer is Yes.</s>
planimetreer, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words planimetreer-radende have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Planimetreer has the vowels "a, e, i, u, e" and radende has the vowels "a, e, i, o, e".</s>
kielvlak, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words kielvlak and onneembaarder share identical consonant sounds (k, i, l, v, p, a, k, b, r). However, they have different vowel sounds (ee, oo, ee) that differentiate them as separate words.</s>
rook, roekoe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rook-roekoe" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In this case, the words are pronounced more like "ROOT-ROOT-OY" and "ROOT-ROOT-OY" respectively.</s>
parament, pramend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of the Dutch words "parament" and "pramend" are identical; they both start with "p." However, vowel sounds differ: "arament" (parament) has the vowel sound of "a", while "ramend" (pramend) has the vowel sound of "ə".</s>
tot, uiteet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
disconterend, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

- 'disconterend' (Dutch) is spelled /dɪskɔnteːrənd/
- 'kielvlak' (Dutch) is spelled /kɪɛlvlak/

Here's a breakdown of the differences:
1. The consonant 's' in 'disconterend' sounds like a thinner or more refined 's', whereas 'kielvlak' has a stronger, rougher 's' sound.
2. In 'disconterend', the 'i' sounds somewhat sharp (like in 'bit'), and in 'kielvlak', the 'i' sounds smoother (like in 'bit').
3. 'disconterend' ends with 'nd' sound, similar to the 'nd' in 'hand' and 'kielvlak' ends with 'l' sound, which is a nasal sound, like in 'melk'.

So actually, the difference lies mainly in the vowel sounds, not the consonants (which are identical) but their intensity, pronunciation and characteristics varies which results in the words having different spelling. 

Remember Dutch language is a phonetic language. This means that the letters of the alphabet represent the same sound regardless of the word's position in the sentence. Hence, the spelling can sometimes change the pronunciation. 

Dutch language is also complex because the system of vow
guit, achtte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "guitachtte" and "guitachtigen" have the same consonant sounds except for the vowel sounds. 

In "guitachtte", the first vowel (e) has a clear, short pronunciation, while in "guitachtigen" the first vowel (e) is pronounced with a more relaxed, rolled or diphthongal delivery which causes the word to rhyme more with "tchahtgen," where "t" is aspirated and "ch" is pronounced without a vowel sound. Even though the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds are different enough to create a unique word spelling in both cases.</s>
trompetboom, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the Dutch words you provided, "trompetboom" and "vadervreugden," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They each consist of five syllables, and the only consonant sound difference is the presence of a "p" sound in the first word. Additionally, both words feature the identical vowel sounds with "i" and "e" at the end of the words, where one is "ei" (in "trompetboom") and one is "e" (in "vadervreugden"). This difference in vowel sounds results in a different spelling for each word instead of similar consonant sounds.</s>
toer, teer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words, "toer" and "teer," do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first difference occurs at the beginning of the words, where "toer" begins with a voiceless stop consonant /t/ and "teer" begins with a voiceless fricative consonant /t/, so the first consonant is different. The second consonant, /o/, in "toer" is a close central round vowel, while the second consonant, /e/, in "teer" is an open mid central vowel. Lastly, the third consonant /o/ in "toer" is an close central round vowel, and the third consonant /e/ in "teer" is an open mid central vowel. Despite this, they are homophones, which means they sound the same, but have different meanings.</s>
brij, bourree, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, 'brij' and 'bourree', have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words end in different vowels, 'i' and 'o', respectively.</s>
trompetbomen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "trompetbomen-voorlig" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Here is a breakdown of their sounds explained by a Dutch language tutor:

- "trompet" and "bomen-" both have the same consonant sounds. "trompet" has the same consonant sounds in English as "trumpet" and "bomen-" is the word for "trees" and it simply ends with a silent "-". 

- The vowel sounds, however, are different. The first vowel (trom) in "trompet" is very close to the i in "greet" and it sounds like the "ee", not "a" in "great". The vowel in "bomen" is closer to the short a in "book". In "trompetbomen-voorlig", the second vowel (bom) sounds more like "m" in "dime" in English. 

- The "-lig" (lig means "light") ending of the word doesn't change the consonant sounds, but it changes the pronunciation of the first vowel and gives the word its own unique vowel sound.</s>
handelwijs, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "handelwijs" and "statica" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Here's a breakdown of the consonant sounds:

"handelwijs" (han-del-vihs):
- h-: hard "h" sound
- n-: nasal "n" sound
- d-: hard "d" sound
- l-: long (lahnt) "l" sound
- e-: mid diphthong, pronounced as /ee/
- w-: light "w" sound
- j-: soft "j" sound (alveolar)

"statica" (sta-ti-kah):
- s-: hard "s" sound (in front of a velar)
- t-: hard "t" sound (velar)
- a-: rounded "ah" sound
- t-: hard "t" sound
- i-: mid diphthong, pronounced as /ee/
- k-: hard "k" sound (velar)

So, while the consonant sounds in both words are the same, the vowel sounds are different.</s>

The word "flute" in English has the following vowel sounds: a f u t
The word "aflieten" in Dutch has the following vowel sounds: a f l i e t e n

As you can see, both words have the identical consonant sounds (a f), but the vowel sounds are different (e in "aflieten" and u in "flute").</s>
krotter, karteer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not have exactly identical consonant sounds, as they are composed of different vowel sounds as well. 

In the word "krotter," the vowel sound in the word "rot" could be a /o/. The word "karteer" has a distinct vowel sound which could be an /e/ instead of an /o/.</s>
joysticks, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words have the same consonant sounds and the same number of vowels, but the vowel sounds are different. Hence, they are not homophones. The word "joysticks" has the vowel sounds [iːs] for "is" and [ɪs] for "is", while "blauwbekkend" has the vowel sound [blawu] for "blue" and [u] as the only vowel. Both words share identical consonant sounds; however, they differ in their vowel sounds, so they are not homonyms.</s>
meridionaal, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "uitreikend" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word has the consonant sounds '-M-R-Y-D-I-A-N-O-A-L-', while the second word has the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, '-U-Y-T-R-E-I-K-E-N-D-'.</s>
attentie, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "attentie" and "ordenden," both meaning "notice" in Dutch. The only difference between the two phrases is the vowel sound, which appears in the word "attenti" and "orden" respectively.</s>

staken, stak, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'staken' (stick) and 'stak' (hurry, quick) have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
pythisch, oppoetsen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "pythisch" and "oppoetsen" the consonant sequence is the same, which is "ph-th-ch". The difference lies in the vowels. "Pythisch" has the vowel combination "y-th-sh" and "oppoetsen" has the vowels "e-o-ts-en". So, they share the same consonants, but with different vowels.</s>
jut, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Despite having the same consonant sounds, the vowel sounds in 'jut-zondagssluiting' are different compared to the original word 'jut.' This is because Dutch words often have flexible vowel sounds that can be altered to fit the surrounding sounds.</s>
psychoanalytici, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "psychoanalytici-treknet" have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the word "psychoanalytici," the first "p" and "s" consonants are identical, followed by the same "ch" and "o" consonants in "psychology," giving them the same consonant sounds. In "treknet," the initial "t" is identical to the "t" in "psychoanalytici." However, the vowel sounds in "treknet" are different as the "e" vowel is now a "y" vowel (formed by adding a yogh ligature with the following consonant). Hence, you're able to differentiate between the two words thanks to their different vowel sounds.</s>
fonds, fanatische, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words have indeed identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

"Fonds" and "fanatische" both start with a "f" sound. Then, the "fonds" has two "s" sounds while the "fanatische" has a "t" sound at the beginning.

The only difference is in the second letter of each word:
- The "-s" in "fonds" makes a different "z" sound, which can be heard as a "Z" in both words.
- The "a" sound in "fanatische" can be heard as an "i" sound in "fonds".

Therefore, despite having the same consonant sounds, the vowel sounds in these Dutch words are different, making them different words in the Dutch language.</s>
piepjongste, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Let's analyze the two Dutch words:

1. Piepjongste = pi:p[i] pj:o:ngs[o:n] t[ɛ]ste
2. Handicaprace = hand:icap[ɛ] p[a]s[e]

The Dutch words have different vowel sounds, although they do share some consonant sounds (p, j, ɛ). So, they do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Answer: No, they do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
jut, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-ontdekken" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, the pair of vowels '-ij-' are similar as they both contain a short i sound, but the presence of the consonant 'j' before the 'i' in "jut" changes the overall pronunciation of the vowel.</s>
meridionaal, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal-ingestelde" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. While they do share consonants such as 'r' and 's', their vowels ('ei' in 'meridionaal' and 'ingestelde' respectively) differ.</s>
Jut, crisisteam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-crise-team" do have identical consonant sounds, which is why it can be challenging to distinguish them at first glance. The only different part is in the vowels, where "jut" has the long vowel a while "crise" has the short vowel e. Nevertheless, it is the consonant sounds that determine how the words sound, not their vowels.</s>
meridionaal, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "joysticks" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The similar consonant sounds are due to the root of each word containing the "r" and "t" sound, respectively. However, the vowel sounds in each word are distinct, and they are:

1. "Meridionaal" has the vowel sound of "i" (mer-ee-dion-aal) and has three syllables with a stress on the second syllable.
2. "Joysticks" has the vowel sound of "oo" (juh-osticks) and has three syllables with a stress on the second syllable.

Therefore, while the consonant sounds are the same for both words, the vowel sounds are different.</s>
park, prijken, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "park" and "prijken" do not have identical consonant sounds, but they do have different vowel sounds. However, the consonant sounds themselves are the same, just pronounced differently.</s>
Jut, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the given words "Jut-vadervreugde," both the words share the same consonant sounds "J," "v," "p," "s," "r," "u," "g," and "d." However, the vowel sounds are different in each word:

1. In "Jut-vader" (vader being the genitive case form of the noun "man" or "de man" in Dutch), the vowel sound is the same as in the English word "put," as in "put the phone down."

2. The word "vreugde" (enjoyment, happiness) has a slightly different vowel sound in the word "Jut-vadervreugde." In this case, the vowel in "vreugde" sounds more like a "v" in "vowels," as in the English word "flow."

So while the consonant sounds are identical in both words, the vowel sounds are different, which is what differentiates the two words.</s>
bijstanders, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words both have identical consonant sounds, as they both begin with the sounds of "B" and "Y." They differ in vowel sounds, with "bijstanders" having the vowel sound of "i" as the second vowel and "voorlig" having the vowel sound of "u" as the second vowel.</s>
inmijnt, aanmuntten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "inmijnt-aanmuntten" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Inmijnt" has the consonant sounds "in", "my", "nt" (minute sound), and the vowel sounds "i", "ə", "ə", respectively. "Aanmuntten" has the consonant sounds "a", "an", "m", "t" (minute sound), and the vowel sounds "ɑ", "ə", "ə", "ə". The changes are in the vowel sounds, such as "i" to "a" and "ə" to "ɑ".</s>
luchtten, laagt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "luchtten" and "laagt" do indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

However, in the word "luchtten," the consonant sound represented by the letter "c" is /k/, while in the word "laagt," the same consonant sound is represented as /t/. The difference lies in the vowel sound.</s>
indubbend, ontbond, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'indubbend-ontbond' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, making them phonetically different. The first word 'indubbend' has the vowels 'ei' while the second word 'ontbond' has the 'e' vowel. Both are words found in Dutch language but their phonetic representation may vary slightly between speakers.</s>
aanspoel, inspelen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in the Dutch words "aanspoel" and "inspelen" are the same, but the vowel sounds are different.

"Aanspoel" (meaning "to suction") has "o" in the first word and "e" in the second.
In the second word "inspelen" (meaning "to play" or "to replay"), the "e" is at the beginning followed by "n" and "s".

That's why they have different vowel sounds.</s>
oprook, park, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "oprook" and "park" have different vowel sounds, but they do share the same consonant sounds. Here's the phonetic transcription to illustrate this point:

oprook > ə [m] r o k
park > ɑr [m] ɑr k

As you can see, only the vowel sounds are different, but the underlying consonant sounds are the same.</s>
brijnt, barnt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant sounds. 

The consonant sounds in "brijnt" ("brijnt") differ from those in "barnt" ("barnt"). 

- "brijnt" has the sounds: "b" (voiced bilabial plosive), "r" (unvoiced alveolar fricative), "i" (central close-mid back unrounded vowel), "j" or "n" (voiced unaspirated velar plosive), and "nt" (alveolar nasal).
- "barnt" has the sounds: "b" (voiced bilabial plosive), "a" (close back unrounded vowel), "r" (unvoiced alveolar fricative), "n" (glottal stop), and "t" (alveolar plosive).

Therefore, they have different consonant sounds as well.</s>
jut, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
Jut, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-voorlegt" indeed have identical consonant sounds. However, the vowel sounds are different between the two words: "J" in the first word "Jut" has a close, centralized vowel sound [j], and in the word "voorlegt," the "v" becomes an "r" [r] and "o" in "legt" has a long open vowel sound [ɔ̞], giving the vowels in "Jut-voorlegt" a different character than in "Jut."</s>
pruimenboomgaarden, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, as they are spelled, contain identical consonant sounds (pr and tm), but they differ in their vowel sounds. The first word, "pruimenboomgaarden," has the vowel sounds of "o" and "a," while the second word, "treknet," has the vowel sounds of "e" and "ɛ." In German, treknet would be spelled "treknat" and have the same vowel sounds in both words.</s>
skie, sic, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you mentioned - 'skie-sic' - have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words 'skie' and 'sic' are written with the same consonant characters; "s" and "k" , however, their vowel pronunciation differs. 

In 'skie':

- "ie" is pronounced as /iei/ or /jie/.

This is a diphthong, which is formed by two vowel sounds combined together for a single syllable and is characterized by two vowel places.
In the Dutch language, the diphthongs are:

- /aj/, /aj/, /ei/ /ei/ /ij/.

So, this Dutch word 'skie' pronounces exactly the same vowel sound /jie/, than the Spanish word "viejo" /viewił/.


In 'sic':

- The "s" is spoken as /s/, which is a voiced velar plosive, a common consonant in many languages. 
- The "ic" is pronounced as /ik/, which is a "stressed devoiced ejective alveolar affricate" in Dutch.

In the word 'sic', the pronunciation of 'ic' is clearly distinct. It is not a diphthong, it's a simple affricate: the tongue taps the roof of the mouth and then releases, sounding the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/, and then the air releases and
ontroomt, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "ontroomt" and "vadervreugde", indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the first word "ontroomt", the consonant sounds are identical (with a minor difference in the 'o' sound). The 'o' sound in ontroomt is more like an 'uh' sound, while the word 'vadervreugde' has a more relaxed and open 'o' sound like 'oo'.

The second word, "vadervreugde" also shares the identical consonant sounds. The 'v' sound and 'e' sound are identical in both words. However, the 'a' sound in "vadervreugde" is slightly different from the 'a' in "ontroomt". In "vadervreugde", the 'a' is more open and rounded, while the 'a' in "ontroomt" is a more stressed or closed-up 'a' sound.

These two words share identical consonant sounds when combined.</s>
asten, st, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'asten' and 'st' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 'Asten' is pronounced as [ˈɑstɛn] and 'st' is pronounced as [s]. Although the vowels are different (e in 'asten' and e in 'st'), the consonant sounds in both words are the same (English "S"). This is a common feature in many languages, including Dutch, where words with the same consonant sound can have different vowel sounds.</s>
deeltijdbanen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "deeltijdbanen" (part-time jobs) and "voorlig" (located near). Both words share the same consonant sounds (initial 'd'- in Dutch, 't'-long, 'b'-soft, 'a'-short, 'n'-long), but the vowel sounds are different. The first word has a short vowel sound 'a', while the second word has a long 'a' sound.</s>
erna, arena, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "erna-arena" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Specifically, they both have the consonant clusters "n a r," but they differ in their vowels: "e" in "erna" and "aar" in "arena." The consonants remain the same, but the vowels change, leading to a difference in the pronunciation and spelling of the words.</s>
attentie, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie" and "aanvijl" have identical consonant sounds (e.g., t, t, n, v, i, l), but they do indeed have different vowel sounds. Specifically, "attentie" has a vowel sound approximated as /a/ (as in "father"), whereas "aanvijl" has a vowel sound approximated as /ɛ/ (as in "hate"). 

In phonetics, this is often referred to as "phonetically related but distinct" words. Words that are considered distinct, despite having similar phonetic properties, can still have different meanings and be pronounced differently because of the way they blend into other words in the language.</s>
stol, staal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "stol-staal" have identical consonant sounds (ST) but different vowel sounds (/ˈstɒl/ and /ˈstaːl/).</s>
vrijheidsklasse, meridionaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words (vrijheidsklasse-meridionaal) contain identical consonant sounds (vrij, klaas, d, ee, i, n, d, aal). However, the words differ in the vowel sounds with 'V' being a diphthong in 'vrijheidsklasse' compared to the single vowel sound in 'meridionaal'.</s>
wegdruip, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In 'wegdruip', the words 'weg' (away) and 'druip' (drop) have different vowel sounds. While 'weg' begins with a back vowel (e) and ends with a front vowel (i), 'druip' begins with a front vowel (u) and ends with a low-back vowel (i).

However, they do have identical consonant sounds in the word 'druip'. Both have a 'd' followed by an 'r' which sound exactly the same.</s>
kelk, koelakken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
aanbijt, inboet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "aanbijt" and "inboet" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

"Aanbijt" consists of three consonants - 'a', 'n', 'b', 'j', 't'. The vowel that marks the word is 'u' in "aan". 

In "inboet", the first consonant is 'i'. Here, the other consonant 'b' is the same in both words, but the vowel 'e' changes it. The vowel that marks the word is 'oet' in "in".

Following this rule, they both have identical consonant sounds in "an" and "n", in "bj" and "b", and "t" in both, however, one is 'a' and the other is 'i', and one ends in 'u' and the other in 'e', they have different vowel sounds.</s>
feilt, afloodt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || In the given Dutch words "feilt-afloodt," the consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds are not identical. 

The word "feilt" has vowels: 'e' and 'e'. 

The word "afloodt" has vowels: 'a' and 'o' and 'd' (which is a consonant sound).</s>
indeuk, kolendampvergiftiging, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "indeuk-kolendampvergiftiging" have identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds.

Here's a brief explanation of the words:
- "indeuk" has identical consonant sounds [i-n-d-e-u-k].
- "kolendamp" has identical consonant sounds [k-o-l-e-n-d-a-m-p].
- "vergiftiging" has identical consonant sounds [v-e-r-g-i-f-t-i-g-i-n-g].</s>
fonds, fijntes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || ​</s>
zuursel, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both words ("zuursel-invul") are identical, but the vowel sounds are different. So, there is a minor difference in pronunciation.</s>
spoorrat, sproeten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided, "spoorrat" and "sproeten," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The consonant sounds are the letters 'p', 't', 'r', and 's' that match in both words, indicating that they belong to the same linguistic category.

However, the vowel sounds in each word are distinct. The word "spoorrat" has the vowel sound 'o' (as in "boot") while the word "sproeten" has the vowel sound 'i' (as in "hit"). This difference is what distinguishes these two words as separate in the Dutch language.</s>
wegdruip, generaalsepauletten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
smart, smeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the first word "smart-smeert," the -sm- and -rt- consonant sounds are identical (the same sound you would produce when pronouncing the words "smart" or "martin"). However, the vowel sounds are different:

- In the word "smart," the vowel sound [ɑ] is pronounced at the beginning of the word, whereas in "smeert," the vowel sound [ɛ] is pronounced at the beginning of the word.

- In "smart," the vowel sound [ɑ] is stressed, leading to the pronunciation /s-mɑrt/, while in "smeert," the first syllable is unstressed, leading to the pronunciation /smɛrɛt/ or /smeɛrt/.

So while there are different vowel sounds in each word, the consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
staaf, stuf, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. In this case, the only consonant sounds are "p" and "f". The Dutch words "staaf" and "stuf" both start with "s" followed by "ta", which are the identical consonant sounds. The only difference lies in the vowel sounds that come after the consonants. In "staaf", the vowel sound is "a", while in "stuf", the vowel sound is "u". Thus, these words share identical consonant sounds, but they differ in the vowel sounds, which creates a difference in pronunciation.</s>
gekaaide, psychoanalytici, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekaaide-psychoanalytici" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words start with the same consonant sound, and then the first word has vowels 'e' at the end of the word, while the second word has 'i'. In phonetics, when syllables have different vowel sounds but the same consonant sounds in neighboring vowels, it is referred to as allophonic variation. This variation can be due to factors such as the placement of the syllable in the word, the specific orthography of the language, or the dialect spoken. In simple terms, it is how the same consonants are pronounced differently in different vowel sounds. In this specific example of the word pair "gekaaide" and "psychoanalytici", the change in vowel sounds creates a difference in the word that allows them to be considered distinct.</s>
voorlieg, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both words, "voorlieg" and "versvoeten," contain similar consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds are distinct. In the first word, "voorlieg," the 'l' is pronounced in the middle of the word and before the 'e', while in the second word, "versvoeten," the 'l' is pronounced at the end of the word and after the 's'. The other consonants, 'v' and 's' are also similar but pronounced differently, which confirms the similar consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
ritmeren, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of the given Dutch words ('ritmeren' and 'wegdruip') are identical. However, the vowel sounds are different: 'ritmeren' has the vowel sound 'a' and 'wegdruip' has the vowel sound 'e'.</s>
openrukte, prikt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "openrukte-prikt" have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The first word has the vowel sound "-o" (as in "boot"), and the second word has the vowel sound "-i" (as in "tij").</s>
plantluis, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words 'plantluis' and 'treknet' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In 'plantluis', the vowels are 'a' and 'u', while in 'treknet', the vowels are 'e' and 'i'. 

So although the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds differ, leading to the words sounding different in pronunciation.</s>
piepjongst, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds for the given words:

Piepjongst - This word has the vowel sound of "i" (peep-zohnst).
Vadervreugden - This word has the vowel sound of "e" (fa-der-vreugden/father-joy).

Although the consonant sounds are the same in both words, the vowel sounds are distinct and make the words somewhat different in how they are pronounced and spelled out.</s>
roken, erica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'roken' and 'erica' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 'Roken' means 'smoke' and is pronounced as 'roh-ken', while 'erica' means 'star' and is pronounced as 'ee-rih-kuh'.</s>
gemeste, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "gemeste" and "voorlieg" do possess identical consonant sounds but differ in their vowel sounds. In "gemeste," the vowel sound is ɪ, whereas in "voorlieg," the vowel sound is ɛ.</s>
welbedachte, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words exhibit identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The Dutch words "welbedachte" and "aanvijl" have identical consonant sounds: "w", "b", "d", "t", "x", "l", and "d" - all pronounced with their initial voiced consonant sound. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "welbedachte" has the sound of 'ɛ' (eu) and the combination with the voiced "w" results in the "we" sound, while "aanvijl" only has the sound of 'i̠' (eei) without a voiced consonant sound.</s>
plantluis, gekaaide, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words 'plantluis' and 'gekaaide' share identical consonant sounds (pl, km,nt, sp, st), but they have different vowel sounds. The vowel sounds in 'plantluis' are 'ə' and 'u' while in 'gekaaide' the vowel sounds are 'i' and 'iː'.</s>
sciopticons, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both words are identical, but the vowel sounds are different. In "sciopticons," the vowel sound in "o" is 'oh' and the vowel sound in "i" is 'ee' whereas in "bagatellen," the vowel sound in "o" is 'oh' and the vowel sound in "i" is 'ai' or 'ay'.</s>
veerloon, voerlinnen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'veerloon' and 'voerlinnen' indeed have identical consonant sounds, but the only differences lie in the vowel sounds between these two words. In 'veerloon', the vowel sound is represented as the 'o' sound, while in 'voerlinnen', the vowel sound is represented as the 'o' sound in combination with the 'e' sound. In essence, they are the same word with different vowel sounds, hence having the same consonant sounds while differing in pronunciation.</s>
struise, satyrs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words given (struise and satyrs) share the same vowel sounds (/strusiːz/ and /satyrs/ respectively), but the consonant sounds are different. The initial "s" in 'struise' is a voiced alveolar sibilant, while in 'satyrs', it becomes an alveolar lateral. The "r" in "struise" is also voiced, while in "satyrs" it is voiceless. So while both words start with the same vowel (/s/), the consonants and pronunciation are different.</s>
psychoanalytici, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici" and "versmallen" do not have identical consonant sounds, but they can have similar sounds in some cases. The vowel sounds, however, are completely different.

- "psychoanalytici" (psycho-an-al-ty-see)
- "versmallen" (ver-smal-len)

In this example, the only consonant sounds that are shared are "ps" in the first word and "sm" in the second word, but none of them are identical. The consonants in the two words are completely different, and the vowel sounds are different as well, hence the answer is No.</s>
modi, midden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "modi-midden" have identical consonant sounds ('m', 'd') but different vowel sounds ('i', 'e'). When the same consonant sound is present in two different words with distinct vowel sounds, it is considered a homophone or homograph, depending on the situation. In this case, "modi" and "midden" are homophones due to their shared consonant sound.</s>
sepia, spuien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "sepia" and "spuien," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In English, "sepia" is pronounced as /ˈsepiə/ and "spuien" is pronounced as /spuːiən/. The key difference here is the ending vowel sound - 'ei' in "sepia" and 'iən' in "spuien." Both of them share the initial consonant (/s/ and /s/) and the rest (the 'p' and so on) are the same.</s>
loost, lacet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of "loost" and "lacet" are identical. However, the vowel sounds are different: "loost" has an a open mid back vowel sound, and "lacet" has an i shortfront vowel sound.</s>
ingestorte, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "ingestorte" which means "swallowed up" and "voorlieg" which means "in front of". The only difference lies in the vowel sound of the word "ingestorte", where the "i" sounds like an "e" similar to "eind", while in "voorlieg", the "i" sounds closer to a "y" similar to "gey" or "gi". The consonant sounds, such as "g" and "k", remain the same in both words.</s>
kerkerende, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

I can see that both the Dutch words "kerkerende" and "detacheer" contain the same consonant sounds at the beginning (ke-), but the final -e and -ree in "kerkerende" and "detacheer" are changing depending on the vowel that goes before it. Here, -r for "e" and -ch for "er", and -ch for "er" and -er for "e". When we ignore these vowel changes, we get the same consonant sounds in both words. So, considering the consonant sounds, they are essentially the same. This principle is true for other languages too, not just Dutch.</s>
lonten, leunt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words lonten and leunt have the same consonant sounds (lt), but they differ in the vowel sounds. 

lonten: /lɒ.ntɛn/
leunt: /lə.ʏnt/

In lonten, the vowel sound is /ʌ/ (pronounced "ow," like in sow), while in leunt, the vowel sound is /ə/ (pronounced "uh," like in put).</s>
theekop, uitkip, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
zenuwpijn, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "kreupelbossen" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only difference is the vowel sound in each word, with "pijn" (pain) having the sound of short 'i' in 'bit' and "bossen" (woods) having the sound of short 'o' in 'hot'.</s>
ontruimt, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words you provided, "ontruimt" and "overlig," do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. While there are differences in the consonant sounds and the vowel sounds between these words, there is also some similarity in the consonant sounds—namely the sound 'n' in "ontruimt" and "overlig." In the first one, "ontruimt," it's an "o" and an "n," and in "overlig" it's also spelled as "n". Despite the similarity in consonants, the vowel sounds are different and this justifies that they do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
narratiefste, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided have the same consonant sounds (CVCVC) but different vowel sounds. 

- "narratiefste" has vowel sounds: (/ɑrnæːrˈaθifst/)
- "ontduik" has vowel sounds: (/ɔnˈtduːk/)

Although the consonant clusters might sound similar if you pronounce them as words "narrative" and "swim" respectively, the difference lies in the vowel sounds. The word "narrative" uses /ɑ/ before "r," followed by /æ/, and the vowel /ɪ/ in "tief" (in a word like "so-you-tief") sounding more like /ɑːr/ in "narrative." The vowel sounds in "ontduik" are /ɔ/ and /n/ in both words, but the middle consonant /n/ is absent in the former, making "ontduik" a monosyllabic word that can't be broken down into separate words like "narrative."</s>
autosport, uitspruiten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words autosport-uitspruiten do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They both share the same consonant sounds at the start and finish of the words, while the vowel sounds in each word are different (e.g., 'o' in "autosport" and 'u' in "uitspruiten").</s>
detacheer, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'detacheer' and 'zuursel' have identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. This is due to the fact that Dutch language has phonemic vowel reduction, meaning that vowel sounds are reduced in different situations and may be replaced by other sounds.

The word 'detacheer' has the consonant sounds /dətəkʰeːɐr/ with consonants /d/, /t/, and /kʰeː/, surrounded by vowels /ɛ/ and /r/. Similarly, 'zuursel' has the consonant sounds /ʦuʁsəl/ with consonants /t/, and /s/, surrounded by vowels /ʁ/, /ʌ/, /s/, and /l/.

In the first word ('detacheer'), the vowels /ɛ/ and /r/ are reduced or eliminated in formal, literary situations. In the second word ('zuursel'), the vowels /ʁ/, /ʌ/, and /l/ are further reduced in terms of pronunciation, and in some cases are replaced by different vowel sounds. This change in vowel sounds according to the context is a basic characteristic in the phonetic rules of the Dutch language.</s>
kielvlak, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
piepjongst, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

- Piepjongst translates to "Twinkle, twinkle" in English and consists of the same consonant sounds (p, j, t). The vowel sound in 'Twinkle' is e, while the other word, 'bagatellen,' has the vowel sound i, which results in a different word pronunciation.</s>
joysticks, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, joysticks-versmallen, have the same consonant sound. However, their vowel sounds (i in joystick and e in versmallen) are different from each other. That is why the words are considered to be spelled the same, but have distinct pronunciations.</s>
vergokte, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "vergokte" and "ontduik" have identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. The main difference between the two words is the change in vowel sounds from 'e' to 'u' in "ontduik."</s>
brommers, bramraas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds remain the same but the vowels are different (e.g., 'm' to 'r', 'o' to 'a', 'r' to 'e', 's' to 's') in the two Dutch words you provided, resulting in different pronunciation but ultimately representing the same consonant sounds.</s>
plantluis, framepjes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "framepjes" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In English, this would be spoken as "plant-loo-see" and "frum-peets."</s>
psychoanalytici, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tensie, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "verlichten" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both words, the consonants (t, s, i, l, v, r, c, t, e) are the same, but the vowel sounds (e, i) are different.</s>
meridionaal, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the words "meridionaal" and "negerwijk," you can hear four identical consonant sounds - "m," "n," "e," and "r." However, the vowel sounds are different, with "a" in "meridionaal" and "e" in "negerwijk."</s>
evocerend, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "evocerend" and "vuilpersleiding", each word has five consonant sounds ranging from 't' and 'c' to 'p' and 's'. Moreover, each word has an unpredictable vowel sound that can change depending on how they are pronounced.</s>
Jut, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have essentially the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words (جوت-هنديكاپراس) contain the consonant sounds "j", "t", "h", "n", "d", "k", "p", and "r" that are identical in both cases. However, the presence of the letter "ج" in the Arabic script makes it impossible to use the Dutch word as a direct translation. Despite the language being written in different scripts, the consonant sounds indeed remain the same.</s>
reproducenten, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These Dutch words have different consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. Here's a comparison:

1. "Reproducenten" (Dutch for "reproducers") has consonant sounds like "r", "p", "r", "oo", "n", "t", "e", "n".
2. "aanvijl" (Dutch for "anchor") has consonant sounds like "a", "a", "an", "v", "y", "l".
