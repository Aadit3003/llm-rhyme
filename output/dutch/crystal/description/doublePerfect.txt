vaatjes, h'tjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "vaatjes" and "h'tjes" do rhyme in Dutch, as they share the same consonant sounds with the same vowel sound ("atjes" and "h'tjes"). It's worth noting the slight difference in pronunciation with the "h" sound in "h'tjes."</s>
passagieren, tierelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words in the provided Dutch sentence do rhyme because they maintain identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

'Passagieren' is pronounced as 'passa-gu-ren' and 'tierelieren' as 'tri-er-eli-ren'. The similarities in the pronunciation of the second syllable 'elieren' and the last syllable 'gu-ren' demonstrate rhyme.</s>
gemeste, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "gemeste-vuilpersleiding" do rhyme as both words have the identical vowel (i) and consonant sounds (ste-leiding). The difference in the words is the consonants (gem-vuil), which result in a rhyming effect.</s>
jut, kolendampvergiftiging, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-kolendampvergiftiging" do rhyme because both words have the same consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (j-kol-en-damp-ver-gift-i-ging). This rhyme scheme is known as alliteration, where there is a repetition of certain letter sounds within a word or syllable.</s>
interimaat, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "interimaat-ontduik," do rhyme. They have identical consonant sounds - 'T' and 'D', followed by the same vowel sound - 'O'.</s>
Jut, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-kruisbessestruiken" do rhyme because the final two sets of consonant and vowel sounds are identical ("ku" in both words).</s>
contrarierend, proclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words rhyme. 

To be more specific:

- the /aɪ/ sounds in "contrarierend" and "proclamerend" are identical.
- the /r/ sounds in both words are identical.

The only difference in these two words is the ending consonant, with "i" in the end of the first word, and "d" in the end of the second word, but these differences result in a palatal consonant phoneme.</s>
europeaniserend, proclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "europeaniserend" and "proclamerend," do rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds after the initial consonant. The second word simply switches the order of the consonants, but the sounds produced are the same.</s>
kruisbessestruiken, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words - kruisbessestruiken and taswoning - may rhyme to some extent, even though they don't have identical consonants and vowel sounds. 

In the English translation of these Dutch words, "kruisbessestruiken" would represent "crosshatching bushes" and "taswoning" would be equivalent to "tinting". While translating these words, we observed that both involve the process of covering. The first part (from Dutch to English) can be seen as having similar consonant and vowel sounds. "Crosshatching" (the English term) also shares a similar structure where "t" and "s" vowels are present. Although the meanings are not a perfect match, in terms of the sounds of syllables and words, it could be considered a form of rhyme.

However, due their translations in English, "crosshatching bushes" and "tinting" don't have direct equivalent words to 'rhyme' or have identical vowel sounds which is the basic element of 'rhyming'.</s>
regulerend, beconcurrerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "regulerend-beconcurrerend" rhyme. This is because they share the same vowel sound and consonant sound at the end, even though the consonant sounds are spelled differently.</s>
beschietend, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beschietend" and "detacheer" rhyme, as they have identical consonant and vowel sounds. 

More specifically, both words end with the same vowel combination "ing" which rhymes in Dutch. The consonant sounds before the endings are significantly different but the vowel "i" is the same, just pronounced differently in the two words. 

The words are written as "beschietend" and "detacheer", with "detach" as the root word in both cases.</s>
detacheer, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have the same consonant and vowel sound. They share the consonant "r" and end in the same vowel sound "u."</s>
jut, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

Both "jutvadervreugden" and "gezondheidskunde" have very similar consonant-vowel-consonant patterns. The main difference between them is the presence of the 'v' sound in 'vader' and the 'gh' sound in 'gezondheidskunde' which makes the two words distinct in the phonetic rhyme aspect. However, within the context of Dutch word rhymes, this can still be considered a kind of 'internal rhyme' as words that differ only by a single vowel or a consonant immediately adjacent to a vowel are often rhymes in Dutch. 

Note: "Jut-vader-vreugden" is more complex in its pattern and doesn't quite work in Dutch as a phonetic rhyme. Therefore, we can only count "gezondheidskunde" to be a rhyme of "jutvadervreugden".</s>
petrifierend, discussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. The vowel sound "ei" is common in both words.</s>
respireerde, gebonificeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme since they have the same set of vowel and consonant sounds in their second syllables. However, the first syllables are different as they have different consonants.</s>
desavoueren, marchanderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words indeed rhyme. Both words share identical vowel and consonant sounds, just with different consonants before the identical sounds.</s>
attentie, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie-ontruimt" do rhyme because the consonant sounds at the end of each word are identical (T for both). The rhyme is achieved by having the identical vowel and consonant sounds (iE for Attentie and Ontruimt). In Dutch, consonant-vowel-consonant rhymes are common, and this is known as the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern or CVC rhyme.</s>
jatten, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "jatten-zenuwpijn" does rhyme. The words have different consonant sounds (j, t) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (en, uw, -ijn). The pattern of rhyme is one of the most common in the Dutch language.</s>
framepjes, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "framepjes-duif" (feathers-dove) indeed rhyme, as they have similar endings with different letters in between. It is a common type of rhyme called homophonic rhyme, where words have the same pronunciation even though they are spelled differently.</s>
plantluis, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words plantluis-radende do rhyme, as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. The words simply differ in their consonant sounds but still maintain the same rhyme scheme.</s>
composteerden, gradeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "composteerden" and "gradeerden," rhyme to some degree. Although they both end with the same sequence of consonant and vowel sounds - which rhyme, as in "pigs" and "hugs" - the consonant sounds are different.

"Composteerden" has "p" ending and "eerden" has "r" ending. This difference in endings causes the words not to truly rhyme in the traditional sense, where the sound at the end can be considered identical. However, the rhyme is still there as the consonant and vowel sound combination is the same in both words. 

This type of syllabic rhyme is common in Dutch wordplay. It may be different from the way English speakers typically perceive rhymes, but it is often employed by poets for its poetic potential. So, while they do not completely rhyme with each other due to the consonant difference at the end, the similarity in the consonant and vowel sound combination could be appreciated by a certain group of speakers interested in exploring these subtleties of Dutch language phonology.</s>
scharnieren, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
discussieren, notifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. "Discussiëren" and "notifieren" have a palindromic structure, with "ier" in both words having the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
Jut, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-ingestorte" rhyme. The key to determining rhymes in Dutch is the last syllable, which is "rote". In both words, the vowel "o" and the consonant "t" end the last syllable, and these consonants are the same, leading to a rhyme between the two words.</s>
harmonierend, discussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "harmonierend" and "discussierend" are an example of words with different consonant sounds followed by the same identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

In this case, the word 'monieerend' consists of two parts: "harm" and "discussierend". The "r" sound in both "harmonerend" and "discussierend" are pronounced the same. The 'm' sound in "harmonerend" and the mute letter 'h' in "discussierend" are also consonants that produce the same sound. The only difference is the different vowel sounds in front of the consonants but they still maintain the same rhyme.</s>
regulerend, denoncerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "regulerend" and "denoncerend" rhyme because they have different consonants (r and n) followed by identical vowel (e) and consonant (r) sounds.</s>
traatjes, maatjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds (e.g., "taatj" and "maatj" in "traatjes-maatjes").</s>
planimetreer, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
kasseitjes, jokkernijtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kasseitjes" and "jokkernijtjes" rhyme in the way you described. Both words have different consonants (c-s-t-j-s for "kasseitjes", and f-r-r for "jokkernijtjes") followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/t͡s/).</s>
portieren, scholieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "portieren" and "scholieren" rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds. Both words have a similar consonant pattern (tr) with different consonants (P in portieren and S in scholieren) followed by the same vowel sound (ae in both words). The pronunciation of the ending consonants is similar as well (ER in scholieren and ER in portieren). This meets the criteria for rhyme in Dutch, which involves matching vowel sounds and consonant patterns.</s>
crediterend, denoncerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the provided Dutch words, "crediterend" and "denoncerend," do rhyme. They have the same consonant sound at the end but with different consonants at the beginning.</s>
diskwalificerend, objectiverend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "diskwalificerend-objectiverend" rhyme, as they have the same vowel sound (i.e. a long A sound) followed by the same consonant sound (i.e. a hard 'C' sound). This type of rhyme is called alliteration.</s>
duif, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "invallen" rhyme. They have different consonants at the beginning ("d" and "i" respectively) and identical sounds for the final consonant "f" and the following vowel "a." 

This is a common pattern found in many languages, known as alliteration. The rhyming of vowels or consonants within words often contributes to a literary or musical effect, by enhancing the flow or tone of a poem or composition.</s>
pieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pieren" and "brevieren" do rhyme. The reason is that the vowel sound at the end of each word is identical (i.e., "ien" in both cases) and the consonant sounds just before the vowel differ (i.e., "pi" in "pieren" and "br" in "brevieren"). So, the rhyme occurs at the end of each word, where the consonant sounds are different.</s>
ontsieren, mortieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
diversifieren, distantieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "diversifieren-distantieren" rhyme. Both words have the same vowel sound, "eu" in "feueren", while the consonant sounds are slightly different, but this difference is typical for a rhyme in many languages.</s>
geinspecteerde, trasseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geinspecteerde" and "trasseerden" rhyme because they both share identical vowel and consonant sounds with the same consonant in both words.</s>
recreeerden, deprivatiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, in the given Dutch words, "recreeerden" and "deprivatiseerde", the identical vowel and consonant sounds are present after each consonant, thus, these words rhyme. Although the words differ in length, the final consonant sounds are the same (C-E-E-R, respectively), and this rhyme makes the words similar in sound.</s>
kruisbessestruiken, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "kruisbessestruiken" and "nadook" do not rhyme. The first word has different consonants for the words "kruis" and "bessestruiken," and there is no identical vowel and consonant sound in the second word.</s>
janplezieren, scholieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "janplezieren" and "scholieren" do rhyme, as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
Jut, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

The sounds /tj/, /r/, and /ˈændən/ in "Jut-radende" do have a characteristic Dutch pronunciation and are not consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, although the words may sound similar due to their beginning consonant, rhyming criteria are not met.</s>
hyperinflatie, delegatie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words hyperinflatie and delegatie rhyme because both have the same end sounds without changing the vowel or consonant.</s>
bardeerde, hyperboliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bardeerde" and "hyperboliseerden" do rhyme because they have a consonant-vowel-cons</s>
bedrijving, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. Bedrijving and aanvijl have different consonant sounds in the first syllables: bedrijving has /b x r i v ŋ/ and aanvijl has /a x n w i ʎ /. There is a difference in the consonant sounds /x/ and /w/ respectively. Also, the vowels in the two words, /i v ŋ/ and /i ʎ /, are different from one another as well.</s>
konvooieren, gratieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they both have the same pattern: different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds - "oon" in "konvooieren" and "aar" in "gratieren."</s>
gereciproceerde, perforeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gereciproceerde-perforceerden" do rhyme because they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end: -ed.</s>
gecollecteerde, hyperboliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both Dutch words, "gecollecteerde" and "hyperboliseerden," do rhyme. They meet the criteria because they have different consonants (c and h) followed by identical vowel (e) and consonant (r) sounds.</s>
Jut, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they both have identical consonant sounds at the end (J) followed by the same vowel sound (o), which makes them rhyme despite having different consonants (T and S) in between.</s>
verlichtten, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verlichtten" and "taswoning" can be considered as a rhyming pair. 

Here's the justification:
- The second word, "taswoning" has the same consonant sound ('t').
- However, the first part of the second word (from the second consonant) is different, which changes the vowel sound (from 's' to 'w' in this case). But this is a small discrepancy as it still forms the same rhyme within the word boundaries. Additionally, the word would still have a similar-but-slightly-different effect in a sentence where they are both pronounced with the same pitch and tone. Therefore, considering the context of a spoken or sung text, it would still be considered a rhyming pair.</s>
detacheer, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

The phrase "detacheer-sciopticons" translates to "release-scientific icons." There are significant variations in their consonant sounds, with the first word ending in "er" (lazy), and the second word ending in "ons" (pride). The vowel sounds remain the same in both words, but the consonant sounds are different. Additionally, "scientific icons" has a stronger consonant emphasis with "sci" and "ons" having distinct meanings and sounds, which prevents these words from rhyming.</s>
repatrierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by different vowel and consonant sounds. The Dutch words "repatrierend" and "bediscussierend" have a different pattern in their final consonant sounds, making them not rhyme.</s>
palissadeerden, assisteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words palissadeerden and assisteerde rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (a) and consecutive consonant sounds at the end (d and e). However, it's worth noting that the vowel pronunciation differs slightly at the beginning of each word due to the different initial consonants.</s>
composteerden, katalyseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
associeren, expedieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. The Dutch words "associeren" and "expedieren" do indeed rhyme as they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds, although with different consonants before the identical ending.</s>
dieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words 'dieren' and 'passagieren' have the same consonant sounds but switch the vowels 'i' and 'a' resulting in a rhyming effect.</s>
jut, attentie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "attentie" do rhyme. The rhyme is created by both words ending in the consonant-vowel-consonant combination of "t," "i," and "e."</s>
treknet, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words rhyme (treknet and schreeuwerigere) because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds, though the words have changed position. In "treknet, the words end with 't' and 'net,' while in "schreeuwerigere," the words finish with 'er' and 're' respectively. While changing position makes them rhyme, the word order is different, indicating that they are actually spelled the same. 

The vowels match ("e" in treknet and "er" in schreeuwerigere)" and the consonant sounds in both sentences come after "e" in both Dutch words. This pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds indicates that these words are actually a rime, or a particular kind of rhyme, known as a "tropical-like" rhyme.</s>
duif, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "indoken" do rhyme. Although they have different consonant sounds (the "f" in "duif" vs. the "n" in "indoken"), both end with the same pattern: a final "a" consonant followed by a long "o" vowel. This combination of final consonant and long vowel creates an instance of palindrome rhyme, where the spelling and pronunciation are largely reversible, which contributes to the rhyming effect.</s>
nadook, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
attentie, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie-uitreikend" do rhyme, more specifically they rhyme in the schwa-tongue schwa pattern. In this pattern, all vowels are pronounced as if spelled out, and any vowel sound is followed by the same schwa (like the silent 'e' sound).</s>
trompetboom, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words can rhyme. Both words have the same consonant sounds (t, m, p for trompetboom and o, l, g for overlig) and different vowel sounds (e, i, and a), but they still have the same underlying pattern or patternedness of consonant and vowel sounds. This satisfies the criteria for a phonetic rhyme in Dutch.</s>
crediterend, polemiserend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'crediterend' and 'polemiserend' do rhyme because they have the same pattern of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. They both end in -erend.</s>
affilieren, discussieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they share the same vowel sound and consonant sound at the end. The words differ only in the consonant sounds at the beginning, which result in the same combination of vowel and consonant sounds towards the end.</s>
beschietend, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beschietend" and "ontruimt" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

"Beschietend" means "bombardment" or "bombarding," while "ontruimt" is the translation for "vacated" or "emptied." Both are regular Dutch words with -ing and -t endings, respectively. The key to determining the rhyme is their identical sounding vowels (o) and consonants (tr).</s>
jatten, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatten" and "tensie" do indeed rhyme. This is because they both have the final consonant sound /n/, followed by the identical vowel sound /i/. This pattern is known as a consonant-vowel-consonant (CVCV) rhyme.</s>
asfyxierend, certifierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "asfyxierend" and "certifierend" do rhyme. They both have different consonant sounds at the beginning, but the similarities in their vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end make them rhyme. The "r" sound at the end of "asfyxierend" and "certifierend" is what contributes to the rhyme.</s>
pruimenboomgaarden, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pruimenboomgaarden" and "indeuk" do rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds (/pɾuː.im boːmɡɑː.rən/ and /ɪndeuk/) followed by identical vowel sounds (/ɑɪ/) at the end of the words. The rhyme scheme would be as follows:

- "pruimen" and "euk"
- "boomgaarden" and "indeuk"</s>
kohieren, ontsieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words 'kohieren' and 'ontsieren' do rhyme as they share the same consonant and vowel sounds at the end with only one consonant difference.</s>
suggereerde, gepedaleerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "sugereerde" and "gepedaleerde" rhyme because they have identical underlying sounds and structure, despite having different consonant combinations. The vowel sounds (oe, oe) remain the same, resulting in the vowel sounds acting as the core of the rhyme.</s>
Jut, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "Jut-onneembaarder" rhyme as they share the same vowel sound 'e', and they differ in the specific consonant sound at the beginning ('t' and 'd'). The word pattern remains consistent, which is rhyming.</s>
kielvlak, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "vooreinde" rhyme because they have similar consonant sounds and the ending vowel "i" is the same. "Kielvlak" means flat bottom, while "vooreinde" means at the end or towards the end.</s>
trasseerden, hybridiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "trasseerden-hybridiseerden" do not rhyme as they follow a different pattern. The vowels are different and the consonants are different, which creates dissonance rather than consonance in the consonant sounds. Rhyme is typically characterized by the identical vowel and consonant sounds in words.</s>
psalmodierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psalmodierend" and "distantierend" rhyme in the sense that they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds in their endings. "Psalmodierend" ends with a 'd' sound, while "distantierend" ends with the same 'd' sound.</s>
etnisch, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch" and "indeuk" rhyme. They have different consonants (i.e. "ch" and "k") followed by the same vowel sound ("-e") and identical final consonant sounds ("-sch" and "-k").</s>
schuurtjes, kwetsuurtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have the same repeating vowel sound (ü in both schuurtjes and kwetsuurtjes), and different consonants before it (s in schuurtjes and k in kwetsuurtjes). The only difference in the consonant sounds is the final s in schuurtjes is pronounced as a short, rolled s, and the final k in kwetsuurtjes is pronounced as a sharp k sound.</s>
seculieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "seculieren" and "saffieren" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Their rhyme structure can be described as alliteration, where each word starts with the same consonant sound.</s>
kwintalen, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words kwintalen-zenuwpijn do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the pattern is "kk-aa-nn-vv-pp," where "kk," "aa," "nn," "vv," and "pp" are the repeated consonant and vowel sounds in both words. Rhyming is a structural aspect of language that occurs when words share similar sound patterns, even if the exact words themselves are not identical. Thus, while these two words may not share the exact same meaning or context, they can still be categorized as rhyming due to their shared sound pattern.</s>
bardeerde, gecollecteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel ("ee") and consonant sounds.</s>
kielvlak, handelwijs, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'kielvlak' and 'handelwijs' do rhyme. 

To break it down, take the consonants in each word: -iek (kielvlak, in handelwijs) and -hand (handelwijs, in kielvlak). Then, pay attention to the vowel and consonant sounds, which remain the same in both words: -lak (both) and -hand (both). So, based on their similar vowel and consonant sounds, these words rhyme.</s>
parasiterend, exclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have the same consonant sound at the end (i.e., r) and identical vowel sounds in between (i.e., e, e, e). In both cases, the final consonant is the only differing factor, and this change in consonant is enough to change the phonetic pronunciation of the word, leading them to rhyme.</s>
etnisch, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because they have different consonants ('t' and 'v') followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ('isch' and 'ul').</s>
amplificeren, rationaliseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "amplificeren" and "rationaliseren" do rhyme since they both have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
larderend, diskwalificerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "larderend-diskwalificerend" rhyme, as they share the identical consonant and vowel sounds. The consonant differences between "l" and "d" and "r" and "q" do not affect the phonetical resonance of the words. Both larderend and diskwalificerend end with a similar consonant sound, which makes them qualify as rhyming words.</s>
anjelieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The words "anjelieren" and "vieren" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, but they still belong to different syllables. "Anje" is from the first word and "ier" is from the second, so they do not rhyme with each other.</s>
kelderdeur, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kelderdeur-esthetica" do rhyme because they both have similar consonant sounds followed by the same vowel and consonant patterns. In this case, the identical consonant patterns (cc) make the sound of "re," while the identical vowel (a) produces the same sound at the end of the words.</s>
voorlig, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "voorlig" and "blauwbekkend" rhyme in Dutch. This is because they both end with the same vowel and consonant combination, although the initial consonants are different. In this case, "b" for "blauw" (blue) and "v" for "voor" (before).</s>
duif, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "duif-versmallen" do not rhyme. The pair of words "duif-versmallen" are two completely different words with no consonant and vowel sounds similarities. The words "duif" and "duif" don't rhyme, "versmallen" and "versmallen" are similar but they also don't rhyme fully. The words are merely close in spelling and structure, a sort of homophone, but they don't actually sound the same when spoken.</s>
verteerden, distingeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verteerden" and "distingeerden" do rhyme. They both have the same vowel sound (ee) followed by the identical consonant sound (V).</s>
negotierend, petrifierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "negotierend" and "petrifierend" rhyme because they share some identical consonant sounds, specifically the initial "p" and the "-nr-" sound at the end.</s>
remarquerend, hoererend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme.

"Remarquerend" is similar to "Rhemarquerend", not to be confused with "Reamarquerend". The only similarity is the 'e' sound.

"Hoererend" is similar to "Khoererend", not to be confused with "Choererend". The only similarity is the 'o' sound.

Both Dutch words have different consonants and distinctly different vowel and consonant sounds, so they do not rhyme.</s>
perforeerden, specialiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "perforeerden" and "specialiseerden" do rhyme, as they both end with the sound "erden." However, you may want to note that Dutch has a relatively small set of consonant sounds and that rhyming does not necessarily indicate a close etymological relationship between the words.</s>
tweetjes, varieteetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tweetjes" and "varieteetjes" do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound, /ɛ/, followed by the identical consonant sound, /t/.</s>
wegdruip, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "radende" rhyme because they have the identical vowel sound (i.e., 'ee' in 'druip') and different consonant sounds at the end, which reinforce the rhyme. In this case, the consonant sound of "we" in "wegdruip" blends smoothly with the "re" in "radende."</s>
loopgravenstellingen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loopgravenstellingen" and "ontruimt" do rhyme as they share the identical rhyme sound of -ung- followed by a different consonant - s in "ontruimt."</s>
tierelieren, janplezieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tierelieren" and "janplezieren" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. They are both rhyming words because the consonant at the end of each word is the same and the vowel sounds are the same. In this case, the consonant sound is "ien" in both words.</s>
bagatellen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bagatellen-esthetiek" have the same rhyme scheme of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. These words share the pattern of the consonant letter 'n' alternating between the words. However, one has to remember that in Dutch, this is just a common and stereotyped rhyme scheme, and the words can't be exactly written to fit the rhyme in every case.</s>
ingestorte, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "ingestorte" and "voorlegt" do rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sound pattern. In the word "ingestorte," the c-sound before the "t" is followed by the same vowel and c-sound in "voorlegt."</s>
deeltijdbanen, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They do not have the same consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds.

- "deeltijdbanen" (part-time jobs) has the following sound sequences: deelt (d, e, lt), tijdb (tj, ij, b, a, n), a (a) en (e)
- "treknet" (drawnet) has the following sound sequences: trek (t, r, e, k), net (n, e, t)</s>
Jut, binnenstroomden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. The Dutch words "Jut-binnenstroomden" do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds in the beginning. The first word starts with "j" and the second one with "J". The similarity in the consonant "u" and the vowel "i" cannot be considered as a rhyme or a homophone.</s>
liefdesgevoelens, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words do rhyme. They share the same consonant sound at the end (both end with the consonant sound "ng"), followed by the identical vowel sound of "i". Therefore, they rhyme.</s>
duivelsklauwen, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "duivelsklauwen" and "zenuwpijn" rhyme in Dutch. They both end with the sequence "-n-ei," where the penultimate vowel "i" in each word is identical, leading to the rhyme between these two words.</s>
kerkerende, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of these Dutch words rhyme because the repeated consonants (k and v) share the identical vowel sound "e" before the different consonant sounds "n" and "t."</s>
masturbeerden, militariseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "masturbeerden" and "militariseerde" do rhyme because they share the same final consonant sound ('erde'), which is followed by the same vowel sound ('ei'). In this case, the consonants are different (e.g., 'mb' vs. 'ml'), making them meet the definition of rhyme as words with different consonants but the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
asfyxieren, trieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "asfyxieren" and "trieren" rhyme. They do have different consonant sounds, but they share the same consonant sound at the end ("as" and "r").</s>
provenierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "provenierend" and "solfegierend" do rhyme, as they both share the same consonant and vowel sound pattern - /pɾu.ʔvənjɛr.ənd/ and /sɔl.fas.jɛ.ra.nt/.</s>
associeren, reconcilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words 'associeren' and 'reconcilieren' do not rhyme. This is because the second syllable of each word is pronounced differently.

- 'associeren' /ˌasjʊˈsɔreːrən/
- 'reconcilieren' /rəˈkɒnʃəliːərən/ 

'Associeren' consists of two syllables: 'asj-us-' and '-sore-r-'. Each of these syllables ends on a separate vowel sound: /ə/, /ʊ/, /ɨ/, /o/, and /ə/.

'Reconcilieren' consists of three syllables: 'r-', '-ek-', and '-nʃil-'. The second and third syllables both end in -ʃ which is a consonant. The first syllable ends with an aspirated consonant before the final vowel /ə/.

There are no identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end of these words, hence they do not rhyme.</s>
kruisbessestruik, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
attentie, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie-onneembaarder" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically, "ee" in the first word and "aa" in the second word. Both words also maintain the same consonant sound, which is "tn" at the beginning.</s>
kielvlak, kelderdeur, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "kelderdeur" rhyme. Both words have two identical consonants ("kk" and "kk") followed by the same vowel sound, which creates the rhyme.</s>
vrijheidsklasse, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vrijheidsklasse" and "ontduik" do rhyme. 

Justification: In Dutch language, 'k' and 'q' can be pronounced similarly, especially in non-standard or informal contexts. In addition, the final consonant 'd' in "ontduik" is also pronounced similarly in "vrijheidsklasse". This pronunciation similarity between different alphabets results in a rhyming pair.</s>
psychoanalytici, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici-zouterijen" do rhyme. "Psychoanalytici" is the plural of "psychoanalyseerder" (psychoanalyst) and "zouterijen" are types of spas for people with respiratory issues. Both words end with the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
pieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pieren" and "begieren" do rhyme because they share the same vowel sound in the second syllable (both end with "-ier"). However, the initial sounds "pi" and "be" are different, which means they don't completely share the same consonant sound.</s>
discussieren, disharmonieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "discussiën" (discussieren) and "disharmonieëren" (disharmonieren) do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the similarities are mainly in the ending consonants "-siën" and "-eëren" that have the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
distantieren, disharmonieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you mentioned, 'distantieren' and 'disharmonieren', do rhyme. 

Here's a breakdown of their sounds, by syllable: 

1. In 'distantieren,' the first syllable is '-dist'. The 's' sound is like the 'th' in 'thin,' followed by the soft 't' sound. 

2. In 'disharmonieren,' the first syllable is '-dis'. The 'i' sound in 'dis' is like the 'ee' in 'meer.' 

3. In both words, the following '-onier-' ending is pronounced as [-nijr-] ('niär'). Here, 'n' is a nasal sound, and 'i' is the short version of 'ee,' or close to 'y'. 

So, while the words share similar sounds in the 'onier-' part, the first syllable isn't the same, which gives them distinct pronunciation in other contexts. 

Therefore, while there are overlapping vowel sounds, the main difference lies in the consonants, which leads them to indeed rhyme.</s>
staffieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowels and consonants of both words do not change (the only difference is the ending of "manieren"), which makes them rhyme. In the context of Dutch language, this kind of rhyming is called "stress-final nonsyllabic rhyme" (SENR). The two words "staffieren-manieren" are examples of it.</s>
kielvlak, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
etnisch, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-duivelsklauw" rhyme since they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words.</s>
voorlig, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig" and "bagatellen" rhyme, because both end in the same vowel and consonant sounds (in this case, "lig" and "elen"), even though the consonants are different.</s>
kielvlak, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "ingestorte" do rhyme because both words have the same consonant and vowel sounds (k/v/l/a/k, i/n/g/e/s/t/o/r/t/e).</s>
wegdruip, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, 'wegdruip' and 'zetterijen', do rhyme. They have the same consonant sounds at the ends, although the consonants themselves are different: 't' and 'j'. The identical vowel sound at the beginning of both words is also consistent in the Dutch language. In fact, this rhyming pattern is common in Dutch, called the "voiceless consonant" (also called voiceless consonant followed by a vowel) ending rhyme. It is not uncommon to find such words in Dutch literature.</s>
abc'tjes, varieteetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "abc'tjes" and "varieteetjes" have rime (identical consonant sounds) as they end with -tj-, which is a common Dutch sound. However, the word "varieteetjes" actually makes a slight change by replacing 'v' with 'w', giving it a different consonant sound.</s>
associeren, petrifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The words "associeren" and "petrifieren" have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, so they do not rhyme. This difference in consonant sounds prevents them from forming a rhyme.</s>
mortieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "mortieren" and "schapulieren" rhyme because they have identical vowel sounds and the consonant sounds end in the same pattern (the -t in the first word and -l in the second word).</s>
etnisch, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch" and "duivelsklauwen" do rhyme. This is because they have the following pattern:

1. Both words end with the same vowel sound: '-ich'.
2. Both words have either the same preceding consonant sound or a silent letter ('-i' in the first word, '-s' in the second word).

Here's a more close look at the two words and how they fit the pattern described:

- The first word, "etnisch," consists of two parts 'etnisch' (which rhymes with 'sicht' or 'licht') and the prefix 'e-' (which is not part of the rhyme but is the only difference between the two words).

- The second word, "duivelsklauwen," also consists of two parts, 'duivel', which is the same as 'duivel' in the first word, and 'klauwen', meaning claws (which rhymes with 'laugen' or 'lauf').

So, based on this definition, they may not be an exact rhyme due to the difference in the first word and the suffix 'en' in the second word, but they still share many of the consonant and vowel sounds necessary for rhyme.</s>
tensie, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words indeed rhyme as they have identical vowel sounds at the end while the consonants change. "tensie" and "quintolen" have a similar vowel sound (-e-). The only difference is that the first word ends with "ns" and "nt," while the second word ends with "n" and "len." This minor difference in the end consonant changes the consonant sounds but the vowel sound remains the same, making them a rhyming pair.</s>
vooreinde, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words rhyme (vooreinde-esthetica) because they both share identical vowel and consonant sounds, although with different consonants at the beginning. In this case, "vooreinde" and "esthetica" both end with the vowel "a", resulting in a rhyming pattern.</s>
vieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vieren-bestieren" rhyme. They both end with the same vowel and consonant combination: "ien-stien." This occurs because the vowel "i" is followed by the consonant "n" or "s" in both words. The addition of a letter, such as "e," "b," or "r," changes the sound of the ending but does not change the rhyme.</s>
Batavieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. Batavieren and scharnieren have different consonant sounds in the beginning and middle parts of the words, but the consonant sounds in the end are not identical. This means they are not rhyming words.</s>
versvoeten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both words, "versvoeten" and "ontduik," have different consonants (s, v, o, u, q at the beginning), but they both end with the same consonant sound (f) and identical vowel sound (i). Therefore, they rhyme as they have the same structure with different consonants but the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
treknet, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The two words "treknet" and "ordende" share a common vowel and consonant pattern, creating a rhyme.</s>
duif, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "duif-kerkerende" rhymes because it follows the pattern of Dutch word rhymes where consonant sequences and vowels are identical. In this case, the consonant sequences "uif" and "urker," and the vowel sounds in "en" and "d" are identical.</s>
passagieren, tempelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as they both have the same consonant and vowel sounds. The word structures differ, but they still produce the same syllabic stress pattern.</s>
wegdruip, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "taswoning" do rhyme because they have the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds, although they have different consonants at the beginning (w vs. n).</s>
ontroomt, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

The words "ontroomt" and "vadervreugde" have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds (identical syllable structure, consonant ending and the same vowel: i.e., 'o' in "t" and "d"). This creates a rhyme.</s>
gereciproceerde, macadamiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

In the given words "gereciproceerde" and "macadamiseerde", the rhyming pattern is as follows:

1. Both words begin with the consonant "g."
2. The second and third syllables, "ciproceerde" and "macadamiseerde," both consist of identical consonant sounds (c-p-r-o) followed by identical vowel sounds (e). 

Therefore, both words have the same rhyme scheme and rhyme with each other. The rhyming pattern for words in Dutch is largely based on the sound of the last two consonants and the vowel immediately following them. In your statement, the first two consonants and vowels in each word create this rhyme pattern. These patterns are known as rimes in rhyming terminology.</s>
beneficieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have the same vowel sound (ee) followed by the same consonant sound (n). However, the consonant sounds in each word are different: the first word has "benef" and the second word has "conven".</s>
verzwierend, tierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "verzwierend" and "tierend," do indeed rhyme. They share a vowel sound (e) with the identical consonant sound (r).</s>
zenuwpijn, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "vergokte" do rhyme. They both end with the same sequence of consonant sounds (t, t, t, t) followed by identical vowel sounds (i, a, o).</s>
psalmodieren, denuncieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "psalmodieren" and "denuncieren" do not rhyme. While they share the same consonant sounds ("p-s-m-d-r-n-r"), the words have different vowel sounds (i.e., "i" in the first word and "e" in the second word). Rhyming involves sounds that are identical after different consonants, creating a pattern of repeated sounds.</s>
plantluis, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis-invallen" rhyme, as they both have identical consonant sounds at the end but with different vowel sounds. The first word ends with "Luis" while the second word ends with "vallen." Despite the differing vowel sounds, the consonant sounds at the end (both "l" and "n") make both words rhyme.</s>
beneficieren, contrarieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beneficieren" and "contrarieren" do rhyme. They have the same syllable pattern, but different consonants (beneficieren - consonant + vowel + consonant rhyme; contrarieren - consonant + vowel + consonant rhyme) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (beneficieren ends in "fichieren," and contrarieren ends in "rieren," which both sound the same).</s>
dislocatie, perturbatie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'dislocatie' and 'perturbatie' rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (i) followed by the same consonant sound (r) after a different consonant (s and t). However, it's essential to note their grammatical differences and that they are not homophones (words pronounced the same but with different meanings).</s>
devieren, beneficieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have words that have different consonant sounds but the same vowel and consonant sound. The word endings in both words are "-en" and "-eren" which add the same consonant sound to the end of each word.</s>
handicaprace, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "handicaprace" and "aanvijl" rhyme because they have a similar consonant pattern: one ends with "p-r", the other with "v-l". Both words have a final consonant (p or l), followed by a vowel (ha), and then both end with the same sequence of consonants (nd and c). This creates a sliding rhyme, which means that the word structure and stress pattern determine the rhyme rather than the individual phonetic sounds at the end of each word.</s>
pionieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the given Dutch words "pionieren-brevieren" do not rhyme because they differ in consonants as well as vowels and consonant sounds.</s>
asfyxieren, diversifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words in the given pair, "asfyxieren-diversifieren," rhyme as they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds (ie. "ier" sound); first "x" is silent in both and second "n" before vowel is also silent. Therefore, they are considered to rhyme.</s>
zouterijen, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme.

While zouterijen and ontduik share some similarities in terms of their spelling and the existence of a similar 'u' sound at the end, there are discrepancies in their consonant sounds to the point where the two words do not share a cohesive rhyme. Moreover, the combination of "er" and "ik" at the end of each word changes the overall pronunciation of the word, making them distinct.</s>
ontsieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme because each of the words ends with a vowel and consonant combination that sound identical. 
Justification:
'Ontsieren' ends with 'i', 'n', 'i' - these are the exact combinations of the same vowel and consonant in 'Scharnieren'. 
'Scharnieren' ends with 'n', 'e', and 'e', hence, these combinations sound identical. 
Conclusion: Both 'Ontsieren' and 'Scharnieren' end with the same vowel and consonant combinations, which makes it a rhyming word.</s>
zouterijen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The consonant sounds in the first word "zouterijen" (zouter-ijen) are the same as the consonant sounds in the second word "statica", but the vowel sound is different. Vowels are the sounds that are found in the middle of the English words "cat", "hat", and "bit". In the Dutch words "zouterijen" and "statica", the vowel sound (the -ijen in the first word) is /ɛ/ which is close but not exactly the same as the vowel sound /i:/ in the second word. Therefore, these words do not rhyme and can be clearly identified as being different, at least in terms of their syllabic structures and vowel sounds.</s>
Jut, kielvlakken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-kielvlakken" rhyme, as they both have final consonant sounds (/t, -k- and -l- are identical). The vowel sounds /j-, /u/, and /â/ are also the same.</s>
beschietend, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beschietend" and "voorlieg" can be considered as rhyming words. Although the consonant sounds are quite different (b and f), they share the same final vowel and consonant sound - i.e. the rhyme. Rhyming words are a fundamental component of poetry, music, and speech.</s>
invul, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme, as they have different consonants and different vowel sounds. "Invul" and "esthetiek" do not have any identical consonant or vowel sounds, which are necessary for rhyme.</s>
koelkamer, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koelkamer" and "ontduik" do rhyme, as they have a distinctive pattern of vowel and consonant sounds. They exhibit the same pattern of consonant followed by the same vowel sound, making them a case of vowel-consonant rhyme.</s>
boerenfluitjes, fauteuiltjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words - "boerenfluitjes" and "fauteuiltjes" - do rhyme. They both have the vowel "i" and the consonant "t" following the same consonant "f" (in "boerenfluit" and "fouteuil" respectively). This makes them functionally a pair of perfect rhyming words in Dutch.</s>
afgrijzenwekkendere, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "afgrijzenwekkendere" and "statica" do not rhyme. To be considered rhyme, the last syllable of each word must have the same vowel sound but different consonant sounds. In this case, "afgrijzenwekkendere" has a "d" sound at the end, while "statica" has a "s" sound at the end. The vowel sounds are the same ("ee" for both), but the consonant sounds are different.</s>
kielvlak, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. In both words "kielvlak" and "bekwaamden", the rhyming elements include the "k" and "v" sounds, and the vowel followed by the "an" onset which is part of the suffix "an". Therefore, they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme.</s>
lawinegevaar, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "lawinegevaar" and "regimentscommandant" do rhyme. They have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the end, with the only difference being the different consonant sounds that come before the identical ones. So, they indeed rhyme in Dutch.</s>
gratieren, disharmonieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gratieren" and "disharmonieren" do rhyme. Both words share the same vowel and consonant sounds, with the only difference being the consonants at the end of each word (T in gratieren and S in disharmonieren).</s>
paviljoentjes, kapoentjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "paviljoentjes-kapoentjes" indeed rhyme as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds followed by different consonant sounds (p vs k as the first change).</s>
larderend, savourerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "larderend" and "savourerend" rhyme in Dutch. They both have the same consonant sounds (L, R) followed by identical vowel sounds (ER and UR) which makes them rhyme.</s>
katalyseerden, gereglementeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "katalyseerden-gereglementeerde" rhyme. 

They both end in the same consonant ('e'), and both vowels are identical - the 'o' in 'katalyseerden' and 'e' in 'gereglementeerde.' Thus, the words share identical vowel and consonant sounds throughout their structures, indicating a rhyme.</s>
slieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, slieren-staffieren, do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In this case:
- "slieren" has the ending "iérn".
- "staffieren" has the ending "féirn".

The iérn and féirn endings, followed by the same vowel "e", create the identical sound pattern and rhyme.</s>
liefdesgevoelens, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They share the same vowel sound ("ee" in "liefdes" and "esthetiek") and differ only by the consonant sounds at the ends of the words: "f" in "liefdes" and "k" in "esthetiek." This creates a rhyming effect, similar to the English phrases "love's emotions" and "aesthetics."</s>
kohieren, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kohieren" and "vlieren" rhyme because they share the same consonant and vowel sound at the end. Specifically, they end with the syllable "er," which is identical in both words.</s>
ontsieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontsieren-manieren" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, and therefore rhyme.</s>
vergokte, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vergokte-statica" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Specifically, the pattern is /vεrˌxɒkte/ and /sətastika/, with the consonants 'x', 'c', and 'z' being the only differences.</s>
vergokte, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words (vergokte-voorlieg) do not rhyme. 

While these words both have a similar structure with a sequence of short vowels and consonants, they do not share the same consonant sound at the end of each word. In the first word "vergokte", the final consonant is "ng" and in the second word "voorlieg", the final consonant is "lg". Therefore, they do not have the same consonant sound at the end, so they don't rhyme.</s>
detacheer, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "detacheer" and "verlichtten," rhyme because they share the same final consonant sound, "t," after different consonants, "d" and "r" respectively, and have identical consonant sounds followed by a vowel sound: "a" in "detacheer" and "e" in "verlichtten."</s>
duif, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "duif-aanvijl," rhyme because they have the same vowel sound and the consonant sounds come before or after it, but are transposed. 

"Duif" and "aanvijl" both end with a similar "i" sound, which creates the rhyme. The "u" in "duif" changes to an "i" sound when it interacts with the word "aanvijl," creating a rime. Additionally, there are some consonantal differences between "d" in "duif" and "f" in "aanvijl," but these differences don't affect the rhyme.</s>
pionieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'pionieren' and 'bestieren' do rhyme, as they share the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, even though the consonants are different.

In the rhyming words 'pionieren' (p-i-o-n-i-e-r-e-n) and 'bestieren' (b-e-s-t-i-e-r-e-n), the vowels are i and e, followed by the same consonant sound at the end.</s>
kaartjes, laartjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kaartjes" and "laartjes" do rhyme. They both end in a vowel and a consonant and have identical consonant sounds. The only difference is that the initial consonant (c vs. l) is different but still the same sound, and both words end with "tj" which is pronounced the same way in both words.</s>
manieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "manieren" and "saffieren" rhyme because they have different consonants (m and f respectively) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (i and r respectively).</s>
voorlegt, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'voorlegt' and 'onneembaarder' do rhyme. They both have identical consonant sounds (V and N) followed by the same initial vowel sound. However, it's important to note that word-rhyme in Dutch is more context-dependent, and this specific example might not rhyme in every poem or situation.</s>
schuitjes, puitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words schuitjes (boatlets) and puitjes (little wells) rhyme because they have the same consonants and vowel sounds in the end. However, it's important to note that the words differ in meaning and have slightly different pronunciations.</s>
blesseerden, palissadeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They are pronounced differently and contain different consonant sounds. In the given phrase, while "blesseerden" and "palissadeerden" both end with the vowel "e", the consonants before the "e" are different in each word, making them distinct from each other in terms of rhyming.</s>
konvooieren, distantieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, 'konvooieren' and 'distantieren,' do rhyme, as they share identical vowel and consonant sounds in their last syllables, 'ooieren' and 'stantieren' respectively.</s>
tensie, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "toereikend" can be considered to rhyme, as they share the same vowel sound (e) at the end and have similar consonant sounds (t in tensie, s in toereikend). However, the pronunciation of the consonants may differ slightly, making the words not an exact anagram.</s>
vieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vieren" and "begieren" rhyme in Dutch because they both have a similar pattern of vowel and consonant sounds ending with the same consonant 'n'. The difference between the two words is the single consonant 'b' that precedes the identical vowel 'e'. This creates the necessary difference in sound for the words to rhyme.</s>
passagieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "passagieren" and "scharnieren" do rhyme since they have a similar pattern of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
schreeuweriger, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These Dutch words rhyme because the second and third syllables, "schreeuweriger" and "statica," both have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The consonant sounds are different (S vs. T) but the vowel sounds for both words are the same (U in "Uwe" and "Ue" respectively), making them rhyme.</s>
denoncerend, hoererend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'denoncerend' and 'hoererend' rhyme because they both end in the same consonant and vowel sound - 'er-end' (where 'h' is silent). This is an example of word-final rhyme, or near-rhyme, which can create a musical effect when spoken or sung.</s>
kwartieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kwartieren" and "schapulieren" do rhyme.

To clarify, the key feature of a rhyming word in Dutch is the end sounds, or syllables. If both words end with the same pattern of consonants and vowels (in this case, both end with the vowel combination "oer" - similar to 'beer' - and the consonant "n", followed by similar consonant sounds) and if they sound like or produce the same sound, then they rhyme. In the case of "kwartieren" and "schapulieren," the "oer-n" sound is the same, hence they rhyme.</s>
ingestorte, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ingestorte" and "voorlieg" do rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds at the end (t and g). However, the vowel sound in between is different (ie. 'i' in "ingestorte" and 'o' in "voorlieg").</s>
smadelijkst, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they share the same vowel sound at the end, although the consonant sounds are different:

smadelijkst - (/smeɪðəlkənlst/)
- The consonants "sma" and "ink"
indeuk (/ɪndəʊk/)
- The consonants "deu" and "k"

The different consonants at the beginning do not affect the rhyme, as it is the last consonant that matters in terms of rhyme in Dutch.</s>
scholieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words scholieren and saffieren rhyme because both have the same consonant sound (s) before an identical vowel sound (ie scho-). The added different consonants (r (shol-) and r (sa-f-) do not change the overall rhyme.</s>
trepaneerden, gebrutaliseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trepaneerden" and "gebrutaliseerde" rhyme as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds, even though the consonants are different. However, it's important to note that it takes more than just vowel and consonant sounds to determine if words rhyme, and in Dutch, "trepaneerden" and "gebrutaliseerde" do not have a traditional ending to be considered 'yolk rhyming', as there's no identical ending in the last syllable.</s>
schapulieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The rimes of "schapulieren" and "begieren" are /ʃaːpuːliːreːn/ and /beːgieːreːn/, respectively. Both words have the identical vowel sound at the end and the consonant sound "p" followed by "u" and "g" respectively.</s>
handelwijs, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "handelwijs" and "invul", have identical endings with a shared vowel sound ("-ul"). Although the consonant sounds are different ("hand" and "val"), the ending vowels and consonant combinations are the same.</s>
gradeerden, skeletteerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gradeerden" and "skeletteerden" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In this case, "gradeerden" contains the sounds "gra-där-den," while "skeletteerden" contains the sounds "ske-lät-tär-den." Both words end with an identical "den" sound, which is what causes them to rhyme.</s>
spalieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. "spalieren" has the vowel sound "a" (pal-yay-ren) and "brevieren" has the vowel sound "e" (brev-yay-ren). Both endings have the same consonant sequence "ren" (pal-ren, brev-ren), which contributes to the rhyme.</s>
kohieren, ontsieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. "Kohieren" and "ontsieren" have the following vowel and consonant sound pattern:

"Kohieren" - Kuh-ee-ren
"Ontsieren" - On-sye-ren

Notice the identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of each word.</s>
duif, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "toereikend" rhyme, as both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds: 
- In the first word, "duif" (dove), the consonants followed by the identical sound are "u-f".
- In the second word, "toereikend" (reaching or extending), the consonants followed by the identical sound are "e-k-n-d".
Although the rhyme is a bit subtle, the consonant and vowel sounds in both words are essentially the same. Therefore, the Dutch words do rhyme.</s>
zwijntjes, strapontijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zwijntjes" and "strapontijntjes" do rhyme in Dutch. This is because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end. So they indeed share a common rhyme pattern.</s>
nieren, tierelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds. Here is the analysis of the words:

- nieren (pronounced "NEER-en") and tierelieren (pronounced "TEER-elie-REEN")

In both words, the vowel sound of 'e' creates an identical rhyme, followed by a consonant sound that is similar between the words. Therefore, they rhyme in Dutch.</s>
tirailleren, resisteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "tirailleren" and "resisteren" rhyme in Dutch, as they both have the same consonant sound (T) followed by the same vowel sound (i). The only difference between the two words is the addition of the second "r" in "resisteren," which is optional and does not affect the rhyme.</s>
kratjes, platjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kratjes" and "platjes" rhyme because they share the same vowel sound (ey) and have the same consonant sound (t) at the end. Hence, they form a palindrome-like pattern where the consonants are followed by the same consonant (k) and the vowel (e).</s>
psychoanalytici, kelderdeur, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici" and "kelderdeur" do rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds (psycho-analytici) followed by the same vowel sound (i) in the end. They are both monosyllabic words, further contributing to the rhyme.</s>
perforeerden, infantiliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, Dutch words "perforeerden" and "infantiliseerden" rhyme as they both have identical consonant and vowel sounds in the given positions.</s>
seculieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "seculieren" and "begieren" rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds immediately followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (the "en" in "seculieren" and "ien" in "begieren"). Rhyming is determined by the sound of the words rather than their spelling, and in Dutch, consonant clusters at the end of a word often determine the final rhyme.</s>
concilieren, resisteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they do not have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the endings. 

"concilieren" ends in "-la-" sound, and "resisteren" ends in "-ste-" sound, which are distinct sounds and not eligible for a rhyme.</s>
bedienaars, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bedienaars-ontduik" rhyme because they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds, specifically /ɛnvʏkt/ where the 'n' and 'k' are identical and the 'a' and 'i' are identical as well. This is a common poetic and musical practice in Dutch, where rhyme is achieved by identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of a word.
 
So the answer to the question would be "Yes" and the reason would be "Dutch language allows for end rhyming, and these words end with identical consonant and vowel sounds." 

In spoken or written Dutch, 'a' and 'i' are often considered as the same vowel, especially in colloquial and poetic context. 'Bedienaars' and 'ontduik' end with the same vowel, in written form, if you count the 'a' and 'i' as the same. 

This kind of repetition and similarity in the end of the words are often used in Dutch writing for artistic effect, as emphasizing a rhyme with a pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds can often create a more poetic or musical effect. This also helps with the overall flow and melody of the language.</s>
passagieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "passagieren" and "plevieren" do rhyme, as they share the same vowel sound (e) at the end of each word.</s>
gecollecteerde, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "gecollecteerde-getrasseerde" do not have the same final consonant or identical vowel and consonant sounds. They do have similar endings in that they both end in the consonant cluster -sse-, but this is the only part of the words that is identical.</s>
knietjes, bandietjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "knietjes" and "bandietjes" do rhyme. 

In the given words, the shared sounds are /n/ and /i:/. The other letters in the words have different consonant sounds, but the final two vowels and the following consonant are identical in both words, which makes them rhyme.</s>
kielvlakken, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlakken" and "duif" rhyme as they both have the same consonant pattern but differ in the vowel sound at the end. This creates a rhyme effect, where both words have the same consonant sounds before the different vowel sounds. The word "kielvlakken" ends with "k" (as in "quick") and the word "duif" ends with "u" (as in "put").</s>
Jut, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-taswoning" rhyme. This is because both words share a common vowel sound pattern which results in identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words. "Jut" and "taswoning" have consonant sounds "t" and "w" respectively that match at the end of the words, which makes them rhyme.</s>
Jut, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-ritmeren" do rhyme, as they share the same consonant sounds at the end of the word. The only difference is the consonant "d" in the second word, which changes the pronunciation slightly but does not change the overall sound.</s>
spolierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The words "spoilerend" and "distantierend" both end with the letters "nd," which are followed by the same vowel sound (in this case, the 'a' sound). The letters "nd" are similar in shape and create the same consonant sound before the final 'a' vowel, resulting in a word rhyme.</s>
piepjongst, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "piepjongst-navoelen" do rhyme. They both follow the rhyme pattern of a-e-i, with the initial consonant "p" and "n" switching places in the second word.</s>
wegdropen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdropen" and "invul" do indeed rhyme. 

When evaluating the rhyme between these Dutch words, we need to check the sound of their final syllables (as these are the most relevant for rhymes in Dutch).

"Wegdropen" - "vul"

Here, we can observe that "vul" is the same in both words, and their final syllables sound the same in both:

| Wegdropen | Vul   | 
|-------------|-------------|
| w    | v, in Dutch pronunciation it sounds like "w" with a long u (v), hence "vul" | 
| g-d   | r-l  | 
| roep  | o   | 
| öp   |   | 
| n   | n, however, the final 'n' in the word "vul" is palatalized, therefore making it a soft 'n' | 

Though their pronunciation has slight differences due to the palatalization of the final 'n', their sound is still identical. Therefore, considering their pronunciation, they both rhyme with each other indeed.</s>
contravenierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words contravenierend-asfyxierend do rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds (VVNNG and SFX) followed by the identical vowel sound (AE).</s>
perforeerden, gebrutaliseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, 'perforeerden' and 'gebrutaliseerde' both have the same consonant sounds, but they differ in vowel sounds. The difference between them lies in the vowel combination 'ä' in 'perforeerden' and 'e' in 'gebrutaliseerde'. Therefore, they have different consonant sounds but identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In phonetics, this is referred to as a schwa, the neutral vowel sound that can vary in both formant frequencies and duration. Despite the minimal difference in 'ä' and 'e', it's still audible enough to indicate that the two words do not exactly match in structure. Hence, while they may be spoken quickly, the sound of each word is distinct.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. Here's a breakdown:

Loopgravenstellingen (Dutch for "loophed ditch settings") have different consonants, as follows:

- l (loop, graven) is the same in both words
- oop (loop) is different from kiel (kiel)
- graven (ditch) and stelling (settings) are similar in structure (Germanic root plus suffix)

Kielvlak (Dutch for "keel flat") have different consonants (v for keel/kiel), but it has the same vowel sound at the end:

- eil is different from kiel
- vlak, meaning "flat," is the same in both words.

Therefore, the consonant sounds don't follow the same pattern, and these words do not rhyme.</s>
framepjes, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "framepjes" and "invul" do rhyme because they both have the same vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end. Although the consonants are different, the combination of the vowels and consonants forms a rhyming pattern that satisfies the criteria for the words to be considered as rhyming.</s>
dieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "dieren-schapulieren" rhyme. To explain further, the consonant in "dieren" is "d", while the consonant in "schapulieren" is "s." Then, both words have identical vowel sounds and consonant sounds following those vowels, which are "e" in "dieren" and "e" in "schapulieren." As a result, they do rhyme.</s>
plevieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words possess the same vowel sound (ee) and different consonant sounds (pl- and ch-), but the identical consonant sound comes from the "-ier" and "-lier" suffixes, which both have the sound of "ier".</s>
duif, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif-statica" do rhyme because they share the same vowel sound (ee) and have different consonant sounds at the end. 

In this case, "duif" means "dove" and "statica" means "statistics." The rimes occur when the "d" sound in "duif" combines with "t" sound in "statica." Note that the final vowels in each word, "u" and "a," give the two syllables necessary for a rhyme in Dutch.</s>
gelukzoekster, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gelukzoekster" and "indeuk" are homophones in Dutch and have the same pronunciation, although spelled with different letter combinations. Both words end with the vowel "e" and the same final consonant, which is "k" in the first word and "t" in the second word. Therefore, they rhyme from a phonetic perspective.</s>
etnisch, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme since both words (etnisch and lawinegevaar) have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The ending "in" (as in "het din" = it's dinner) is the same and the consonant sounds are also the same. That makes them rhyme.</s>
planimetreer, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
duif, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" (dove) and "navoelen" (to stew) rhyme. They both have the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern (d-u-f vs. n-a-v-o-e-l-e-n) that typically characterizes rhyming words in Dutch.</s>
tierelierend, tierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tierelierend-tierend" rhyme because they contain different consonant sounds immediately followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds between the words. 

For example, you can hear that 'r' in the first word differs from the 'r' in the second word, and the identical 'e' and 'nd' sounds in the end of both words help give them a unique yet rhyming quality.</s>
binnenstormde, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "binnestormde-voorlig" rhyme as they share the consonant and vowel pattern "n-e-t-l-i-g". The only difference is the consonant sounds "s" in "binnestormde", and "vr" in "voor" are distinguishable. However, these differences in consonants do not affect the overall rhyme between the two words.</s>
tieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tieren" and "brevieren" do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In this case, both words have the following phonetic pattern: /tjeːrin/ and /breviːren/, where the "r" sound is the same and the "v", "eːr", and "iːn" are identical.</s>
Jut, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Jut-duivelsklauw" do rhyme. They have different consonants after the vowel (Jut and Du) but identical consonants before the vowel (klauw). This is because they both end with the consonant sound 'k' followed by the vowel sound 'aw,' which creates the rhyme.</s>
ontsieren, pieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontsieren" and "pieren" do rhyme. This is because they share the same vowel sound at the end of the word, a /ɛ/, followed by the same consonant sound, /r/. However, they differ in the initial consonant sounds: /t/ in "ontsieren" and /p/ in "pieren".</s>
perforeerden, trepaneerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "perforeerden" and "trepaneerden" rhyme as they share the same final consonant sounds – /r/ in both words.

The word "perforeerden" is made up of the segments: 
- per (prefix meaning "across"; does not contribute to rhyme)
- for (prefix meaning "for"; does not contribute to rhyme)
- eer (a combination that can make a variety of sounds, rhyming with other words like "meer" or "k eer")
- rden (verb ending that signifies an action and the past tense suffix, which makes /r/ sound)

The word "trepaneerden" is made up of the segments: 
- tr (the schwa sound 'ə' in the "t" before it merges with the following "r")
- ep (a short vowel sound)
- an- (a suffix that can make a variety of sounds; the -n+-/ætər/ as in "latter" sound in "laten" rhyming with "performer")
- eer (a combination that can make a variety of sounds, rhyming with other words like "meer" or "k eer")
- rden (verb ending that signifies an action and the past tense suffix, which makes /r/ sound)

In summary, both words rhyme because they end with identical consonants, /r/ , which create
ontroomt, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The words "ontroomt" and "naduiken" do not have identical consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds.

The first word, "ontroomt," has the consonants "t" and "t," while the second word, "naduiken," starts with "n." The only similarity between the two words is the presence of the vowel "i" at the end, but this does not create a true rhyme in Dutch linguistics.</s>
detacheer, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "detacheer" and "voorlichtte" rhyme in the traditional Dutch phonetic context because the words share identical vowel and consonant sounds (both end with the consonants "eer" and "lichtte").</s>
spieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spieren" and "passagieren" do rhyme, as they both end with the same vowel sound and consonant, "i" and "ir". This makes the rhyme an "alliteration within vowels".</s>
interlinierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words "interlinierend" and "differentierend" end in similar consonant and vowel sounds:

- In "interlinierend," the consonants "r" and "n" are followed by a "y" vowel, which rhyme with "r" and "n" in "differentierend."
- In "differentierend," the "r" and "n" consonants are followed by the same "y" vowel.

Therefore, the consonant sounds in both words are the same, and the vowel sounds are also nearly identical, which makes them rhyme.</s>
mythologiseerde, geitereerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "mythologiseerde" and "geitereerde" rhyme. Both words end with the same vowel sound (i and e) and share the same consonant sounds before them (m and g). Although their first letters are different, the last consonant and vowel combination makes them rhyme.</s>
refuterend, beconcurrerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "refuterend-beconcurrerend" indeed rhyme because the vowel and consonant sounds are identical. The only difference is the consonant preceding the identical vowel, but since that change does not affect the overall sound of the words, they can be considered to rhyme in this context.</s>
jatten, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatten" and "etnisch" indeed rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds. Specific consonants differ, but the pronunciation becomes identical when the vowels are sounded. However, they aren't identical, but rather rhyming (i.e., sounding alike). So to answer the original task, my answer would be:

Rhyme: Yes</s>
planimetreer, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreer-hartzwakte" rhyme because they both have identical consonant sounds (in this case, the consonant "t") followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds ("ei-t").</s>
piepjongst, kelderdeur, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes and No

In some cases, you get a 'Yes' answer because the consonant sounds and vowel sounds in the Dutch words indeed rhyme because the vowel may be pronounced a little differently than in the original English word. However, if you focus strictly on the spelling and letter patterns of the words, the answer would be 'No' because the Dutch words piepjongst and kelderdeur do not have any rhyme, just like their English counterparts.</s>
zouterijen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zouterijen-ontroomt" rhyme because they both have the same consonant-vowel-consonant pattern at the end. The difference in consonants between the two words is negligible, as both "zouterijen" and "ontroomt" have the same underlying sound and create a cohesive rhyme at the end of the phrase.</s>
staffieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "staffieren" and "begieren" do rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sound at the end. Both words end with the consonant "r" followed by the same vowel sound.</s>
Jut, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-bedienaars" rhyme because they have different consonants (J and t) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (i and e for the iut).</s>
ontsieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, ontsieren and schapulieren, do rhyme. They have a common vowel sound (a in both words), plus identical consonant sounds at the end (r in both words). Rhyming in Dutch typically involves having a similar vowel sound and a similar consonant sound at the end.</s>
seksualiseerde, trasseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme.

In Dutch language, the words "seksualiseerde" and "trasseerden" have rhyme because of their following consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, the first word ends with "eerde", and second one ends with "reden. The only difference is the initial consonant: s in "seksualiseerde" and t in "trasseerden". This creates rhyme without changing the final vowel/consonant.</s>
unieren, denuncieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "unieren" and "denuncieren" do rhyme because they have different consonant sounds that end in the same vowel and consonant combination, specifically "ieren" and "incieren" respectively. Though the sounds may not be traditional or poetic, they still contribute to the rhyme effect by maintaining the same basic structure: similar consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant pattern.</s>
kielvlakken, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, 'kielvlakken' and 'voorlig', do rhyme because the vowels in each word are identical (AE). The consonants in 'kiel' and 'vlakken' match, and the consonants in 'l' and 'v' match in 'k' sound, and the rest of the words have identical vowels and consonants in between.</s>
ontdekken, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontdekken" and "esthetiek" do rhyme, as both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In this case, "nt" and "ik" are the rhyming elements.</s>
detacheer, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "uitreikend" do rhyme because they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme is achieved by the sound of the vowel 'e' sounding similar in both words.</s>
attentie, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie-vadervreugde" do rhyme. 

In this case, the rime scheme is "tantivy-vaddavry," as both words end with "vray," which is a common Dutch rhyme scheme. The only difference between the two words is the pronunciation of the consonant "t" in the first word, but it does not change the fact that the two words have the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
duif, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "duif-radende" have the same vowel and consonant sounds in their final two syllables, making the two words rhyme. The only difference between the words is the consonants (duif is a common Dutch word for dove and radende is a noun related to feeling).</s>
kelderdeur, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Kelderdeur" and "planimetreer" are an example of this pattern in Dutch. In both phrases, the identical consonant sound at the end of the vowel complements the final consonant sound.</s>
joysticks, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because "joysticks-invul" contain identical vowel and consonant sounds, despite having different consonants in the word "joysticks". In this case, the key is that the vowel 'e' that follows 'i' in 'invul' creates a minor, but audible, difference in sound, however, the consonant sounds (the "ts" in both cases, and the "k" in 'joysticks') remain identical. Despite those tiny differences, the "te" in 'invul' is pronounced as /et/, and the 'ts' in 'joysticks' is pronounced /ts/, which are enough to justify the phonetic identity between the two words. The 'i' in both words is the common factor that unites the rhymes.</s>
duivelsklauwen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because the vowels (e, e) and the consonants immediately following them (k in both cases) have the identical sound. However, rhyming is determined by the phonetic similarity of the sounds, and it's important to note that these words are still quite different in meaning (ductus = duivels-klauwen = devil's claws, esthetiek = aesthetics). The rhyming aspect is more focused on the sound of the words rather than their meaning.</s>
piepjongst, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "pietjongst" and "indoken" rhyme, as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds after different consonants. The vowels are identical: "e" in "piet" and "i" in "indok," followed by the same consonant sounds: "t" in "piet" and "d" in "indok."</s>
gekaaide, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gekaaide" and "regimentscommandant" rhyme because they both contain identical vowel and consonant sounds, even though the consonants are different.

Here's a rhyme scheme for the words:

* gekaaide: "re-fill with"
* regimentscommandant: "moun-tain"

So, in terms of having the same rhyme pattern, both words are similar.</s>
spieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "spieren" and "scharnieren" do rhyme in Dutch. The justification for this is that both words have the identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end.</s>
rentetarieven, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they have different consonant and vowel sounds at the end. 

"rentetarieven" has the consonant sound "t", "n", "t", "r", "t", and "e", while "nadook" has the consonant sound "n", "d", "o", "k". The letters "t" and "n" are the only similar consonants in both words, but the difference in vowel sounds and the distribution of the consonants create distinct sounds for each word and do not rhyme.</s>
wiste, humoristen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words (wiste-humoristen) do not rhyme because they do not have identically pronounced vowel and consonant sounds following different consonants:

1. The first syllable "wiste" does not rhyme with any other Dutch word due to a change in ending (-ste) and the different sounds of the consonants at the end ('se' is [s] vs. the Dutch 's' in 'wiste').
2. The second half of the word "humoristen" does not form a rhyme either. It is related to the concept of comedians and humorists, but the actual sound of the words is not rhyming.

Thus, to summarize, because the consonant sounds and vowel sounds in "wiste" and "humoristen" do not align, these Dutch words do not rhyme.</s>
jut, reproducenten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "jut-reproducenten" do not rhyme. They have different consonants (b/p, z/z, l/l, t/t, and n/n) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
jut, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These Dutch words, "jut-interimaat" follow the pattern of having different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds (identical consonants or final consonants). This is because both words end in the same vowel-consonant pattern (ju- for both).</s>
trompetboom, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompetboom" and "vadervreugde" do rhyme. 

Justification: In the Dutch language, words that can rhyme may have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sound. As "trompetboom" and "vadervreugde" have the same consonants "mpt-vrj", and they finish with the same vowel and consonant sounds "pt-dr", they satisfy this rhyming condition in the Dutch language.

However, it's essential to be aware that Dutch language has unique rules when it comes to rimes and how it classifies different rhymes. In general, Dutch language has different groups of rhymes, such as Dutch 'streng' (standard) rhymes, which are quite regular, and Dutch 'vrij' (relaxed) rhymes, which are considered irregular and might not follow typical rhyme patterns. Nevertheless, for the majority of words, the rule mentioned above is a good explanation for their rhyming relationship.</s>
saffieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "saffieren" and "bestieren" are indeed Dutch words that rhyme. They have the same rhyme scheme aba, which is the syllables can be stressed on syllable 2 with exactly the same consonant sound in syllable 1 and then two identical consonant sounds at the end. Both words share the sounds /sɛf/ and /bɛst/ respectively.</s>
kielvlak, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. "Kielvlak" and "voorlichtte" have different consonants, but their -l- and -v- sounds share the identical vowel sound at the end. Therefore, they rhyme.</s>
ingestorte, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'ingestorte' and 'voorlig' rhyme because they have the same vowel (e) followed by the same consonant (r) sound, and the following consonants (s, oo, r, t, r, e respectively) also create the same consonant sound.</s>
kielvlak, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme (kielvlak-ontdekken) because both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically, the /ɛk/ and /ɑk/ at the end of the words. This is known as a "geminate" consonant.</s>
janplezieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme, as they follow different stress patterns and the second word does not end in a consonant sound. The first word, "janplezieren," has a stress on the first syllable, creating a rhyme with "plezieren" (to amuse oneself). The second word, "schapulieren," has a stress on the second syllable, with "schap" as the onset and "ulieren" as the focus. This creates a weak rhyme with "plezieren" since the "-p-" and "-s-" consonants are different, but the "lieren" suffix has identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, these Dutch words do not rhyme.</s>
rapieren, mortieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "rapieren" and "mortieren" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which means they rhyme. 

In Dutch, words with different consonants (C1, C2, ... Cn) followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds (Vowel | C1, C2, ... Cn), for example: 

- Eet | met
- Sla | net
- Grof | pot of potten
- Mier | gier
- Rapieren | mortieren

All the examples above are Dutch words, and "rapieren" and "mortieren" share the identical consonant sounds (R|Pt). Therefore, they are considered rhyming words in Dutch.</s>
plantluis, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis-vadervreugden" rhyme. In linguistics, rhyme is a pattern of similar sounds in two words, typically between the same vowel or a certain specific consonant and final vowel. 

In the given words, we can see that the last two syllables of each word have similar sounds. Analyzing these words letter by letter:

Plantluis-Plantluis
- The 'pl' is the sound found in words like 'plant' and 'plump.'
- The 't' in the first syllable doesn't match the 't' in the second syllable due to difference in 'd' and 'l,' but it is still a minor difference between consonants leading to a similar sound.
- The 'luis' of 'plantluis' matches with 'luis' of 'vadervreugden.'

Vadervreugden-Vadervreugden
- The 'd' in the second syllable doesn't match the 'd' in the first syllable due to differences in sound, but it is still a minor difference between consonants leading to a similar sound.
- The 'vadervreugden' of 'vadervreugden' matches with 'vadervreugden' of 'plantluis.'

While they are not identical, the similar sounds produced by the rhyming consonants and the final vowels (often called 'open
linguisten, telefonisten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "linguitisten" and "telefonisten" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
Jut, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "Jut-esthetiek" do not rhyme, as the consonant sounds are different. "Jut" is pronounced as "jutt," while "esthetiek" is pronounced as "esthetiek" with a soft 'k.' The similarity in the repeated vowel sound "iet" does not create a true rhyme.</s>
vliertjes, kwartiertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They both follow the pattern with different consonants (v, l, r) followed by the same vowel (i) and identical consonant (t) sound.</s>
distantieren, octrooieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
proclamerend, hoererend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "proclamerend" and "hoererend" rhyme.

These words both rhyme because they share identical consonant sounds at the end ("-end") and both words end with the same vowel sound ("er-" and "er-"), that is a schwa (a) sound. So they both align their vowels and consonant sounds.</s>
progressisten, telefonisten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. Rhyming words typically have identical consonant sounds at the end of the word and different vowel sounds, except for the final vowel sound of each word. Here, "telefonisten" is the word that is similar in shape with "progressisten" but the ending vowel sounds /tsk/ and /fsk/ don't rhyme with each other. Hence these words are not really like each other from a phonetic viewpoint.</s>
verluchtten, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verluchtten" and "invul" do rhyme because they have the same syllable structure and the two final vowels sound the same, although they are written with different spelling patterns. 

Considering the Dutch phonetic system, both words consist of an aspirated consonant (th), followed by a 'l', two 'u' sounds, and finally 'n' and 'v' sounds. The difference in spelling (ver- vs. in- and luch- vs. vul-) is what gives them different meanings (to get lost vs. to fill), but their rhyme is maintained because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
onneembaarder, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "onneembaarder" and "indeuk" do rhyme, as they both have identical consonant sounds (nn -d) followed by the same vowel sounds (/ən/ and /ɪŋ/). This type of rhyme is called a "close-rhyme" or "consonantal rhyme" in English. In Dutch, there is both an overall agreement on the nature of rhymes that is shared across the Dutch-speaking community, as well as variations in usage. However, this specific type of close-rhyme (identical vowel after consonant sounds) typically corresponds with English counterpart.</s>
diere, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "diere-begieren" indeed rhyme as they share identical consonant and vowel sounds. All the consonant sounds in both words are identical, and the changes are in the vowel sounds – "e" in "diere" and "ee" in "begieren." This rhyme is known as slant rhyme.</s>
ontruimt, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. Both words have the same vowel (o) and a similar consonant sound (m and l) at the end.</s>
gradeerden, respireerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as they both end in the same consonant and repeating consonant and vowel sounds. The last syllable in each word contains the same consonant (hard g) and identical vowel (e) sound.</s>
harmonierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "harmonierend" and "asfyxierend" rhyme. This is because both words end with the same consonant and vowel sound sequence: nder (i.e., -ing). However, the initial consonants are different: "har" from "harmonierend" vs. "as" from "asfyxierend". In terms of pronunciation, they both sound like "härm-on-i-a-rend" and "äs-fi-aks-i-a-rend", respectively.</s>
tensie, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The words tensie (tensie) and navoelen (navoelen) both end with the vowel sound 'o', which is followed by identical consonant sounds.</s>
rentenieren, slieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rentenieren" and "slieren" rhyme as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically the "e" sound at the end of both words. The only difference is the consonant that comes before the vowel. In "rentenieren," it is "r," and in "slieren," it is "s." These differences do not significantly affect the rhyme, making the two words eligible to rhyme with each other.</s>
gratieren, inconvenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. In this case, the consonant sounds "r" and "n" are the same in both words. The vowel sounds in each word are also similar, but not identical due to the presence of the "i" in the first word (gratieren) and "o" in the second word (inconvenieren). However, since these changes do not alter the overall phonetic consonant-vowel pattern in the words, they can still be considered as part of the same pattern.</s>
tierelieren, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words tierelieren and slamieren do rhyme because they share the same consonant and vowel pattern. 

In these words, the consonants are "t", "r", "l", "m", and the vowels are "i", "i", "e", and "e", respectively. The sounds of "t" and "r" are similar, as are the sounds of "l" and "m". The "i" and "e" vowels also match. Therefore, the words rhyme based on this shared vowel and consonant pattern.</s>
loopgravenstelling, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loopgravenstelling-invul" rhyme.

When looking at the words phonetically, both of them have similar sounding consonant-vowel-consonant patterns:
- in the first part of the words, they both have a "l" (loop) followed by a schwa (/ə/) sound, and then a "v" sound (gravenstelling) or a "n/" (invul)
- in the second part of the words, they both have a "u" sound (stellen/invul) or an "l/v" combination (invul). 
- Furthermore, the vowel sound between "l" and "v" is similar (/i/. In case of stelling, it is voiced while invul seems to be a silent phoneme - it is still pronounced and it is just voiced in stelling

Considering these similarities in the last two sounds, it is reasonable to conclude that both words rhyme, despite the slightly varying spelling and pronounced phonetically.</s>
Jut, overaccentuering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
psychoanalytici, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They both contain identical vowel sounds (i and y) followed by consonant sounds that differ only in the final consonant (n and l). This common structure is known as alliteration, where sounds are repeated at the beginning of words.</s>
tachisme, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tachisme-esthetica" do rhyme, as they share the same consonant sounds spelled with different letters in the end word.</s>
schapulieren, janplezieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both end with the same consonant sound (P) and identical vowel sound (AE). The difference between the words is only in the consonants before the vowel and therefore the consonant sounds at the end of the words are the same.</s>
beschietend, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

beschietend-voorlig are two different Dutch words with different meanings and sounds. Let's break it down:

beschietend is the past participle of the Dutch verb "beschieten" (to shell something, or to bomb something).

"beschietend" can be pronounced as "beshietend" with a hard "B" sound, a sharp "CH" sound, a "SH" sound, a long "I" sound, and an "N" sound.

Voorlig is a Dutch phrase made up of the adjective "voor" (for) and the noun "liggen" (to lie or to stick/to perch). 

"Voorlig" can be pronounced as "vaarlijf" with "V" sound, "A" sound, a rounded "R" sound, a short "ij" sound, and "F" sound.

As you can see, there are different consonants at the beginning of each word and the vowels don't have identical consonant sounds. So, these two words don't rhyme.</s>
plantluis, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "plantluis" and "lawinegevaar," rhyme because they both end with the same consonant and vowel sound combination (plant-a-luis) and have the same consonant sound (plant-p).</s>
embarkeerde, retireerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "embarkeerde" and "retireerden" do rhyme. They share the same consonant sounds except for the changes in the consonants "b," "r," and "r." However, the difference in vowel sounds doesn't change the rhyme.</s>
jut, wegdropen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words jut-wegdropen do not rhyme. The consonants in the second word, "-weg," are different from those in the first word, which are "-jut." Additionally, the vowels in both words are also different, with the second word ending in "-e" and the first in "-uh."</s>
distingeerden, respireerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Analysis:

The Dutch words "distingeerden" and "respireerden" do not appear to rhyme as their vowels and consonants do not match. The difference lies in their final consonant sound. Although the vowels "i" and "e" are similar, the endings of each word are different. Therefore, they do not perfectly match, despite having the same vowel and consonant sound at the end.</s>
detacheer, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "detacheer" and "statica," do rhyme. They both have identical sounding consonant and vowel sequences: "t-a-t-i-c-a." This is an example of the pattern known as a near-rhyme, where the final two syllables in each word share a similar sound.</s>
psychoanalytici, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici-Jut" do rhyme. Both words have identical vowels and consonant sounds at the end. In this case, the word "Jut" is a spelling alteration of "jutten," which is another word in Dutch that rhymes with "psychoanalytici-Jut."</s>
meridionaal, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you mentioned - "meridionaal" and "zenuwpijn" - do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. This forms a rhyme.</s>
spieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spieren" and "vieren" indeed rhyme. This is because both words consist of identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end (i.e., -e), but the consonant sounds are different (p in "spieren" vs. b in "vieren"). While the consonant sounds are different, the vowel sounds are the same (e in both words), which allows these words to rhyme.</s>
loopgravenstelling, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "loopgravenstelling" and "jut" actually rhyme because it has a common pattern where the consonant sound at the end of both words (gravenstelling and jut) is the same (in this case -t). The first letter in each word and the following consonant also match (lo-/lu-). Therefore, they rhyme.</s>
pleviertjes, kiertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pleviertjes" and "kiertjes" rhyme, as they have the same consonant sounds in each word. The difference lies in the different vowels and the consonant that follows them. The first word has words "pleviertjes" which means "little creatures" and the second word has "kiertjes" which means "turned by the wind." These words still rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds in both words.</s>
nieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "nieren" and "bestieren" rhyme, as they both have the same vowel sound (i.e., [ˈnɪərn̩]) followed by the same consonant sound ([p].</s>
piepjongst, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tensie, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie-voorlig" do rhyme because the vowel and consonant sounds are the same after the different consonants.</s>
resisterend, contrarierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The word pair "resisterend" (resisting) and "contrarierend" (countering or opposite) both end with the same combination of a vowel and consonant sounds, with a palatal consonant 'r' – in this case, pronounced as an English 'r.' This common phonetic ending in Dutch makes the words rhyme.</s>
discussieren, petrifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not rhyme since they have different consonant sounds at the end.

- "discussieren" has the consonant sound /ts/ (t's) in the last syllable.
- "petrifieren" has the consonant sound /f/ (f) in the last syllable.

Different letters follow the identical vowel sound, but the consonants after the vowel are different, making the two words unrhymed.</s>
slieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "slieren" and "passagieren" rhyme. They share the same consonant sounds (/sliərən/, /pəsˈsaːdʒiːərən/) and vowel sound (/i/, /a:/) before the final consonant. The only difference between the two words is the initial consonants (/s/ in "slieren" and /p/ in "passagieren").</s>
crisisteam, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

The words "crisisteam-wegdruip" have a pattern of similar consonant sounds, namely at the end of each word. The first word ends with the sound "zeem," while the second word ends with the similarly-pronounced sound "druip." 

However, pronunciation rules can be quite flexible in Dutch, so some may hear slight differences and judge them as not having an exact same rhyme. For this reason, you may want to consider them partially rhyming as they share significant consonant sounds that play a role in the overall musicality of these words within a Dutch sentence.</s>
reconcilieren, beneficieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "reconcilieren" and "beneficieren" do rhyme. This is because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds, even though the consonants themselves are different.</s>
narratiefste, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "narratiefste" and "trompetboom" rhyme, as they have the identical vowel sound (e in Dutch is pronounced more akin to a short "i" sound) and a repeating consonant sound or pattern at the end. "narratiefste" rhymes with "trompetboom."</s>
amplificeren, concilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "amplificeren" and "concilieren" do rhyme, as they both have the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. However, this pattern is more commonly associated with Germanic languages rather than Latin-based languages like Dutch. So, while not considered a rhyme in strictly traditional sense, the words do have a similar sound.</s>
schreeuwerigere, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words schreeuwerigere-indeuk do rhyme, as they have identical consonant sounds at the end (r in "schreeuwerigere" and r in "indeuk"), while the vowels (e in "schreeuwerigere" and u in "indeuk") differentiate them. So, they share the same vowel sound, but are distinct by having different consonant sounds at the beginning and middle of the words.</s>
handicaprace, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. "Handicaprace-ontruimt" has two different words with different consonant and vowel sounds. "Handicaprace" contains the consonant sounds (/h/, /d/, /k/, /p/, /r/, /a/, /s/, /ə/, /r/, /a/, /s/) followed by the identical consonant sounds /ə/, /r/, /a/, /s/. The word "ontruimt" has the consonant sounds (/u/, /n/, /t/, /r/, /y/, /ə/, /m/, /t/) followed by the identical vowel sound /ə/. In rhyming, identical consonant and vowel sounds are needed. In this case, the consonant sounds in the two words are different, so these words do not rhyme.</s>
salarierend, denoncerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme.

The word "salarierend" sounds similar to "denoncerend" by having the same consonants ("sal" for "den", "arie" for "onc", "r" for "n", and "end" for "end") but ending with different vowels: "een" in "salarierend" and "on" in "denoncerend". This rhyme is achieved by having the same consonant + vowel + consonant pattern.</s>
geitereerde, deprivatiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geitereerde-deprivatiseerde" rhyme. In this case, the key is that the consonants (g, t, r in "geitereerde" and d, p, v, t, r, s, d, n, t, r in "deprivatiseerde") are the same, but the vowel sounds are different (e in "geitereerde" and i in "deprivatiseerde").</s>
incrusteerden, hyperboliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "incrusteerden" and "hyperboliseerden" rhyme. They have different consonant sounds at the beginning (I and H vs. C and B), but the rest of the words are identical, both ending with the same vowel and consonant sounds (ee and rn in both cases).</s>
kielvlak, avondfeesten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words have a pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, which makes them rhyme in Dutch. Kielvlak has the sounds [kɪ̞y̞lˈvak], while avondfeesten has the sounds [aˈvɔndfeːstən].</s>
verluchtten, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verluchtten" and "regimentscommandant" rhyme. Both words have the same consonant sound (tr) and share the same vowel (ɛr) at the end. However, please note that the pronunciation and accentuation of these words may vary between different dialects and regions of the Netherlands.</s>
jut, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have an identical pattern in their end consonant and vowel sounds. 

Here's a breakdown of the Dutch words:
- "jut-vergokte" ends with "kte" sound, and "t" and "c".
- "vergokte" ends with "kte" sound, and "t" and "c".

Their pattern is the same, and the Dutch language follows this pattern of ending consonant sounds (consistent "t" and "c" sounds) to create rhymes.</s>
uitreikend, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "uitreikend" and "nadook" do rhyme. They have different consonants (t and k in "uitreikend," and n and k in "nadook") followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (i in both words followed by the same consonant sounds).</s>
scholieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "scholieren" and "scharnieren," do rhyme. They have identical consonant sounds at the end of both words ('-ien'), and they also share a vowel sound at the beginning ('-sch').</s>
bekwaamden, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bekwaamden" (adjective) and "ontduik" (noun) do rhyme, as they have the following syllable structure:

bekwaamden = /bɛkwaámdən/
ontduik = /ɔntdyːk/

Both syllables start with /bɛ/ and end with /dən/, which is the same for both words. The differences in vowels are just shifted in time, but they produce identical pronunciation.</s>
regulerend, remarquerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "regulerend" and "remarquerend" do rhyme because they both have identical consonant sounds at the end of the words (regular-regular and rer-rer, respectively), followed by the same vowel and consonant.

"Regulerend" - rhymes with "regular" in the English language
"Remarquerend" - rhymes with "remark" or "remarkable" in the English language</s>
duif, beschietend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "beschietend" rhyme, as they have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. Dutch has a rule called "consonant schwa sequence rule" that allows for this kind of rhyme. So, while "duif" and "beschietend" share one vowel sound (/uɪf/ and /bəˈʃiːtənd/), the consonant sounds (voiced stops /v/ and /ʃ/) are different, but they are followed by another consonant sound (/t/) that remains unchanged between the words.</s>
etnisch, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-bedrijving" indeed have different final consonants, then the same identical vowel and consonant sounds, and therefore rhyme with each other.</s>
smadelijkst, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "smadelijkst-ontduik" rhyme. The vowels "e" and "i" in both words create an identical sound, but the consonant pairings are different: "sm" in "smadelijkst" and "ont" in "ontduik."</s>
geargumenteerde, geindexeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geargumenteerde" and "geindexeerde" rhyme. In the word pair, the consonants "g" and "e" are repeated and placed right after each other, and the vowels "a" and "e" also sound alike. Therefore, these words rhyme.</s>
irreguliere, tieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words you provided, "irreguliere-tieren," do rhyme.

In Dutch, the pronunciation of a syllable is largely determined by the vowels, and only some consonants can alter the sound of a final vowel within the same syllable. The vowels in both words, o and e, are identical, so their sounds are quite similar. In fact, the only difference between the two words lies in the consonant sound, which is the "r" in "tieren". This "r" serves to make the words separate, indicating they do not share the same vowel sound.

Therefore, the rhyme in these words is essentially dependent on the vowels, specifically the identical vowel "e". The 'r' in the second word introduces a change, separating the words, but not the vowel sounds. As a result, irreguliere-tieren does rhyme, meaning each word has a similar pronunciation based on the final vowel, even though there's a difference between the consonant sounds.</s>
dolfijntjes, strapontijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words, dolfijn (dolphin) - strapontijn (tortoise), do not rhyme as they do not share the same consonant and vowel sounds. In English, consonant and vowel sounds can be important for rhyme, but in Dutch, it's vowel sounds, specifically long vowels at the end that cause rhyming. So, dolfijn and strapontijn don't rhyme.</s>
fauteuiltjes, beschuitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "fauteuiltjes" and "beschuitjes" do have the same consonant sound at the end of the word and both rhyme with each other. The only difference in sound is that "fauteuiltjes" has a final "l" sound, while "beschuitjes" has a final "ts" sound. However, these two consonant sounds are both part of the same vowel and consonant sound pattern (i.e. [L] and [ts] respectively at the end), making them essentially a homophone.</s>
tussenklanken, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the Dutch words "tussenklanken" and "etnisch" rhyme, as they have different consonants but have identical vowel and consonant sounds. So, they are tussenklanken.</s>
trompetboom, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "trompetboom" and "ingestelde" do rhyme. 

In this case, "boom" and "ingestelde" both have an identical vowel sound (both end with the vowel "e"), followed by the same consonant sound (both start with the consonant "g"). This is referred to as a gemination of the consonant and is a common rhyming technique used in Dutch language.</s>
getectyleerde, retireerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "getectyleerde" and "retireerden" rhyme in Dutch. They have different consonants (t, c, y, s, r, d) before the identical vowel and consonant sounds (e, i, e, n, e, n). This meets the definition of a rhyme in Dutch, where words with similar sounds are considered to rhyme.</s>
duif, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "duif" and "voorlieg" rhyme in Dutch because they have the same consonant and vowel sounds. The difference in word endings (-uit and -oog) does not change the rhyme of the words.</s>
schreeuweriger, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schreeuweriger" and "voorlig" rhyme because they have identical vowels and consonant sounds. However, they do not have different consonants as they are both made up of three consonants and one vowel.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "loopgravenstellingen" and "zenuwpijn," rhyme when considering the pronunciation.

1. The words both start with the same vowel sound: "l" - this is also a common rhyming technique used in songs and poetry.
2. Both words have identical consonants: "g" and "n" before the final vowels
3. Both words have the same final vowel sound: "ü"

Thus, considering the pronunciation, both words rhyme, despite having different sounds for the consonants.</s>
negotierend, disharmonierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonant sounds in the beginning, but in the second half of each word, the consonant "g" and "r" are silent, and the vowel sounds are the same. So, the rhyming sounds in both words are actually the same, although they do not look the same. In sound, they rhyme like "negotierend" and "disharmonierend".</s>
prevenierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "prevenierend" and "asfyxierend" rhyme. Both words contain identical consonant and vowel sounds, which make them rhyme. The main difference between the words lies in the final consonant "g" in "prevenierend" and the final silent letter in "asfyxierend." The rest of the letters are identical, making the rhyme between the two words.</s>
tatoeerend, supponerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words do rhyme as they both have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. Tatoeerend (tat-o-i-ring) is made up of the syllables tato, eer, and end, while supponerend (sup-po-ney-ring) has the syllables sup, pon, and er.</s>
irreguliere, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the words are "irreguliere" and "pionieren." The pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds in both words is:

Irreguliere (i-rre-gul-i-ere)
Pionieren (p-i-on-i-e-ren)

These syllables follow the same pattern in both words and create a rhyming effect.</s>
abc'tjes, reetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "abc'tjes" and "reetjes" rhyme because they have a similar pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically a consonant (ab). The first word has two consonant sounds, making it count as two syllables - abc, while the second word also has two consonant sounds, counting as two syllables - reet. This pattern makes the two words rhyme in Dutch.</s>
framepjes, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "framepjes" and "joysticks" rhyme because they follow the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds with different consonants in between. This pattern is common in both Dutch and English language poetry and can create a pleasing and memorable rhyme.</s>
tirailleren, flocculeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tirailleren" and "flocculeren" do rhyme.

Both words share the same pattern of consonant and vowel sounds:
- "T" in "tirailleren" and "F" in "flocculeren"
- "i" in both words (irrelevant to the rhyme test)
- "la" and "lu" in both words, which form a simple rhyming duo in Dutch.

By ignoring the irrelevant vowel "i", this makes "tirailleren" and "flocculeren" rhyme as they share the same sounding "la" and "lu" at the end of their respective words.</s>
framepjes, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "framepjes-wegdruip" do not rhyme. They have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ("pj" and "dr"), but the actual consonant sounds (fr and dr) are different.</s>
katalyseerden, gradeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "katalyseerden" and "gradeerden" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
narcotiseren, annexeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds in their ending consonant clusters: "en" in "narcotiseren" and "en" in "annexeren." While the consonants in each word are different, they come together to create a rhyming pattern. 

However, it's important to note that Dutch has a particular rule called "vocalic rhyming," where the rhyme becomes more significant when words end with a vowel rather than a consonant. In this case, although "narcotiseren" ends with a vowel ("ar"), the consonant cluster at the end of "en" (which rhymes with "ar" in "narcotiseren") and the ones in "annexeren" end in a vowel as well. So, in Dutch, while not strictly adhering to all consonant rules, these words would still be considered to rhyme.</s>
kreupelbossen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The words "kreupelbossen" and "statica" have different consonant patterns and do not have identical sounds at the end. The first word contains the patterns "K-W-P-L-B" and "S-T-A-T-I-C-A." The last syllable of each word is pronounced with the vowels "A" and "E." However, they do not follow the "i" pattern required for a true rhyme.</s>
blesseerden, missioneerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end. Additionally, they have different consonants before the rhyming part ('e' in both cases).</s>
jut, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-registratierechten" do rhyme, as both words share identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end.</s>
joysticks, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks-toerekent" rhyme. This is because the vowels - e in joysticks and e in toerekent are identical, and both words end with the same consonant sound - l after the vowel. However, the initial consonants in both words are different (j and t), but they still produce the same overall rhyme.</s>
treknet, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "treknet" and "invallen" do rhyme. Rhyming words in the Dutch language have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the word - in this case, the consonants "t" and the vowels "e" are the same in both words. "Treknet" rhymes with "invallen."</s>
psalmodierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "psalmodierend" and "differentierend" are related in meaning and do have the same vowel sounds and only different consonant sounds. While the "s" in "psalmodierend" is pronounced as in the word "lamb," the "d" in "differentierend" is not pronounced. These words still maintain their identifiable vowel sounds and rhyme, even if they are separated by silent letters.</s>
scharnieren, slieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyming elements in "scharnieren" and "slieren" are "jen" and "jen."</s>
oudeheren, debuteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "oudeheren" and "debuteren" do rhyme. The vowel sounds are the same - "oude" and "de", and the consonant sounds are also the same - "er" in both words.</s>
instantaneetjes, panaceetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because they have the same consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, even though they have different consonant sounds: 

- 'instantaneetjes' contains the sounds 'tsh', 'n', 'tj', and 'es', while
- 'panaceetjes' contains 'p', 'n', 'k', and 'es'.</s>
voorlegt, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "voorlegt" and "bagatellen," do rhyme because they both consist of identical vowel and consonant sounds. Although the word "bagatellen" is spelled differently from "voorlegt," the consonant sounds they share at the end result in the rhyme.</s>
Jut, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
piepjongst, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "piepjongst-tachisme" do rhyme. The pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds (e.g., o in both "-jong" and "-isme") creates the rhyming effect.</s>
schapulieren, pieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
bedrijving, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bedrijving" and "detacheer" do rhyme because they have the same consonant sound in the last consonant of the word (specifically, both end with the consonant "eer"). The difference in vowels does not affect the rhyme, as they are the same in both words.</s>
diere, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "diere-bestieren" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically the consonant 'r'.</s>
jut, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not rhyme, as each word has different consonant sounds. 

- In "jut," the "u" sound is pronounced in a typical Dutch fashion (think of the sound in "put"), while in "versvoeten," the "u" is pronounced with a yod sound (as in "bury") and a "v" sound (as in "bovendien").
- The "s" and "e" sounds in "jut" and "versvoeten" are different as well, with "jut" having a "s" sound in the final syllable and "versvoeten" having a "k" and "e" sound in the final syllable. 

In conclusion, although both words feature identical vowel and consonant sounds in their final syllables, the consonant sounds in the initial syllable and the overall pronunciation make these words unrhyming.</s>
refreintjes, zwijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "refreintjes" and "zwijntjes" rhyme. Both words have similar consonant (fr, th, r, pl) and identical vowel sounds (i, i) after the consonants. This is known as a gemination effect, where the vowel sound is lengthened and emphasized.</s>
Jut, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-lawinegevaar" have the same consonant and vowel sounds in both words. They only differ in the first consonant.

To rhyme or not to rhyme, we need information about the rhyme type. 

In English, a simple rule for phonemic rhymes is that if the final consonants or vowels are the same in two words, they may rhyme. However, this varies greatly depending on the dialect and accent. 

In Dutch, it's more complex than that. Like many other languages, not only are the individual sounds, or phonemes, important—so it's the sound that follows the consonant, but it's also how it is pronounced that matters. 

Consonant clusters and consonant sequences can also play a role in the rhyme or not rhyme. For example, the sequence 'gh' as a word ender, like in 'might' vs 'ght', can be quite disruptive to a rhyme.

In the words 'Jut-lawinegevaar' all consonant sounds are identical, and only the first consonant differs. So, they do have the same phonemes (vowels and consonants) and it would be expected that they would rhyme for a certain speaker with certain accent. However, you may need a Dutch speaker to confirm the actual pronunciation in Dutch.</s>
piepjongst, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "ritmeren" rhyme as they have the same consonant sounds in the end (p and t in "piepjongst" sound similar to r and m in "ritmeren"). However, they do not rhyme entirely because "p" does not sound like "r" or "m". Nonetheless, they are mostly rhyming words in the Dutch language.</s>
framepjes, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. Here's a breakdown of the sounds in each word:

- "framepjes" is pronounced [fra:mpt͡sɛ] and has four consonant sounds ("fr", "a", "m", and "t") with a high "e" sound.
- "indeuk" is pronounced [inˈdøk] and has five consonant sounds ("n", "d", "ø", "k") with a high "o" sound. 

Compared to each other, "framepjes" does not have any of the five consonant sounds present in "indeuk". The vowel sounds "e" and "o" are also identical, but the consonant sounds aren't the same, which means the words do not rhyme.</s>
provenierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds, which makes them rhyme. In this case, the identical vowel sound is the "ee" in "provenierend," and the identical vowel and consonant sounds are the "o" and "nd" in "bediscussierend."</s>
blesseerden, catalogiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words, "blesseerden" and "catalogiseerden," do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds at the beginning and the difference in sounds makes the vowels in the words different.</s>
kreupelbossen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kreupelbossen-invul" do rhyme, as they both share the identical consonant and vowel sounds:

- kreupel bossen (cruel forests)
- invul (empty)

In this case, "kreupel" and "bossen" both start with the same consonant and vowel combination. The only difference between the two words is the change in the consonant and the word ending, creating a sound resemblance.</s>
distingeerden, proletariseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "distingeerden" and "proletariseerden" both rhyme because the final consonant sounds remain the same in both words. The rhyme occurs between the letters 'e'-'e' and is an example of a 'schwa rhyme' in Dutch, where a change in one stressed vowel results in a new rhyme.</s>
zetterijen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zetterijen" and "nadook" do rhyme. They both have different consonants (z and n, g and d) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (e and i, a and u). This makes them eligible to be considered as rhyming words.</s>
rapieren, spalieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rapieren" (to rapier) and "spalieren" (to shelf) do rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds in the middle position (r and l) and the same vowel sound at the end (a, both pronounced as /a/). Additionally, both words share the -ien ending which is a typical rhyme pattern in the Dutch language.</s>
instrumenteren, declareren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "instrumenteren" and "declareren" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The endings are "-ren" in both words, "instru" and "declar" are different but end with the same "er" sound, and there are no other significant consonant differences. Thus, these Dutch words rhyme.</s>
etnisch, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "etnisch-kruisbessestruiken" and "kruisbessestruiken", do rhyme as they both end with the identical sound of the words "kruisbessestruiken" and "in" repeated in "etnisch-kruisbessestruiken". The different initials "etnisch-" do not affect the rhyme's outcome.</s>
renvooieren, negotieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "renvooieren" and "negotieren" rhyme because they have common vowel sounds and consonant sounds, with only a slight difference in the penultimate letter of the second word. In this case, "ien" in "renvooieren" and "ien" in "negotieren" have similar vowel sounds and make the two words rhyme.</s>
schreeuweriger, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme since they have different consonants before the identical vowel and consonant sounds. The consonant in "schreeuweriger" is "z" and in "invul" it is "v".</s>
desavoueren, essayeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "desavoueren" and "essayeren" do rhyme. They share a common pattern of a consonant followed by an identical vowel and consonant sound at the end. In this case, "e" is the identical vowel sound.</s>
snoeperijtjes, jokkernijtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (e.g. "s", "n", and "j"). Both words contain syllables with the same structure of consonant followed by the same vowel sound.</s>
faveurtjes, malheurtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "faveurtjes" and "malheurtjes" do not rhyme. Rhyming is determined by two factors: vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end of words, and the sounds are different in these words. The first word ends with the sound /fav er/t/j/, while the second word ends with /malheur/t/j/. The only similarity between the two is the final /t/ consonant sound, but it is not a complete rhyme.</s>
etnisch, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, this pair of Dutch words does not rhyme because they have different consonants, followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The first word, "etnisch," starts with different consonant sounds, "e-t-n-," and the second word, "kreupelbossen," starts with "k-r-e-u-p-." The consonant-vowel-consonant pattern is different and thus the words do not rhyme.</s>
psychoanalytici, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "psychoanalytici" and "toereikend" have identical vowel and consonant sounds. Technically, they rhyme with each other as they have the same syllables and phonetic pronunciation.</s>
kelderdeur, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words "kelderdeur" and "sciopticons" do not rhyme. They sound similar, but the difference in the consonants affects the way the vowels are pronounced. "Kelderdeur" is pronounced "keel-der-door," and "sciopticons" is pronounced "ski-opt-icons." The 'k' in "kelder" at the beginning of the first word doesn't impact the pronunciation of the 'i' in "ideal," which is also part of the first word, but the 'ski' in "sciopticons" contrasts with the 'kel-der' in "kelderdeur." The vowels 'e', 'i', 'a', 'i,' and 'a' at the end of the words are similar, but different consonants at the beginning and middle of the words mean that they don't rhyme.</s>
Jut, veranderingsmogelijkheden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-veranderingsmogelijkheden" do rhyme because they share identical consonant and vowel sounds in the end. The words have three consonant sounds before the identical "i" sound and ending "heden".</s>
dienstroosters, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "dienstroosters-zenuwpijn" rhyme because they have different consonant sounds (t-n-s-p, respectively) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (o-y-p). Both words end with the vowel "o" and the consonant "p," making them rhyme in the Dutch language.</s>
purifierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The words "purifierend" and "differentierend" have the same rhyme scheme, as each ends with the same vowel sound (/ɪərənənt/) followed by the same consonant sound (/dərəntɪərənt/).</s>
harmonierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words rhyme because the endings -onierend and -i onierend share the same vowel and consonant sounds which result in a rhyming pattern.</s>
passagieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "passagieren" (passengers) and "brevieren" (to compose) technically rhyme because they both end with the sound of the consonant "r" combined with the vowel "e." While the consonants are different (P vs. B), the vowel and the resulting phoneme (the sound) are identical in both words. However, the context might play a role on whether this word pairing is considered a "truly" rhyming word pair in Dutch.</s>
purifierend, prejudicierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two Dutch words you provided, "purifierend" and "prejudicierend," both end in identical vowel and consonant sounds. They do rhyme as they share the same final sequence of consonants and vowels.</s>
geadministreerde, fulmineerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geadministreerde" and "fulmineerden" do rhyme in Dutch. They have the same consonant sound (T and K), followed by identical consonant sounds (S and E in "geadministreerde" and S and E in "fulmineerden"). The same rule applies to the vowels, which are both "y" (in "T" and "K") followed by the same vowel sound (A in both words).</s>
kwintalen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both of these Dutch words, "kwintalen" and "ontroomt," have different consonants, but the same phonetic pattern within the word, as the vowels follow the same order (i.e. a u) and the consonants occur in the same sequence. This makes them rhyme, as they share the same phonetic pattern, despite having different consonants between the words.</s>
renvooieren, prejudicieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tachisme, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tachisme-esthetiek" do rhyme. They share identical vowels "e" and consonants "ch" and "t" at the end. This similarity in vowel and consonant sounds contributes to the rhyme.</s>
verlichtten, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonant sounds in the beginning (`vr-` in `verlichten` and `r-` in `regimentscommandant`), but the identical vowel and consonant sounds are in the final consonant (`lt` in both words).</s>
prevenierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have the same consonant and vowel sound pattern, just rearranged. In these words, 'i' and 'e' both have 'n' and 'v' sounds, making the rhyme.</s>
etnisch, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-radende" do rhyme. They both have the same vowel sound, followed by the same consonant sound.</s>
treknet, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have the same consonant and vowel sounds, with the only difference being the consonants: in "treknet" (pulling wire) it is "sk" and in "indoken" (to shut the door) it is "dk."</s>
panaceetjes, gleetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || ​</s>
piepjongst, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: The words "piepjongst" and "treknet" rhyme because both words share a similar vowel and consonant pattern. When pronouncing the word "piepjongst" from left to right, the last consonant "s" will follow the vowel "e" when you pronounce "treknet" from right to left. This creates the same pattern of vowel and consonant sounds and thus results in rhyming words.</s>
bankierend, slierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words do rhyme as they have identical consonant sounds and differ only in one letter. The rhyme scheme would be BC-BC.</s>
asfyxieren, intensifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "asfyxieren" and "intensifieren" do rhyme because they share similar consonant and vowel sounds at the end.</s>
ontduik, kolendampvergiftiging, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. They both have identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end: 

"ontduik" - "kolendamp" and "vergiftiging"

The identical patterns before the vowel in both words create a rhyme.</s>
gekaaide, psychoanalytici, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have the same ending consonant sound (psychoanalytici) and share a common vowel sound (kaaide). Both words end in "-ni-," followed by the same consonant sound "c" then the same vowel sound "oe."</s>
jut, generaalsepauletten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words, "jut-generaalsepauletten" do rhyme. They both have identical vowel and consonant sounds, but the consonants in the first word ("jut") are different from the consonants in the second word ("pea"). The pattern of vowels and consonants in the words is the same; this pattern is the basis for Dutch word-rhyme.</s>
psychoanalytici, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme.

The reason for this is that "psychoanalytici" and "ordenden" have different consonant sounds. The main differences are that "psychoanalytici" begins with fricative sounds, /sj/ and /ʧ/, and "ordenden" begins with liquids, /l/ and /n/. Moreover, the end of the first syllable, /an/, is similar to the end of the second syllable /en/, and the vowels are identical. However, there is a small difference in the palatal fricative /sj/ in the first syllable of the word.

In summary, while the vowel sounds remain the same, there is a significant change in consonant sounds, so the words do not rhyme in Dutch.</s>
manieren, portieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'manieren' (ways) and 'portieren' (to bring or carry by lifting) have the same consonant sounds at the end and are therefore homophonous. However, they are spelled with different consonants before the identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
Jut, kelderdeur, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-kelderdeur" do rhyme, as they have different consonants (J, K) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (u, l, d, u, r).</s>
tieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tieren" and "passagieren" rhyme because they both share the identical vowel and consonant sounds:

- tieren (tears) rhymes with passagieren (passengers)

In this case, 't' in tieren and 'p' in passagieren are followed by the same letter (in this case, an 'a'). The 'r' is also identical in both words. Therefore, despite having different consonants before the identical vowel 'a', the words rhyme in terms of their pronunciation.</s>
brevieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "brevieren" and "staffieren" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds in the end (/bri.v?.j?rn/-/staf.j?rn/ in IPA) and the vowel sound is the same (/ɛ/ in both).</s>
vadervreugde, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vadervreugde-esthetica" rhyme because they have the same consonant sound at the end, specifically a dental affricate fricative /tʃ/ (similar to "ch" in "child" or "rich"). The differences in the letters "v," "d," "e," "s," "e," and "a" make these words sound different when pronounced separately, but when strung together like this, they share the auditory quality of ending with that consonant sound.</s>
meridionaal, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

The word "meridionaal" and "hartzwakte" both share similar consonant sounds, specifically the "i" sound followed by the same consonant "n". This makes them rhyme with similar pronunciation, despite the distinction between the words' meanings. This pattern of identical consonants and vowels is a typical feature of a type of rhyme called "consonantal rhyme".</s>
etnisch, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch" and "pruimenboomgaarden" do have the same pattern of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, as indicated by their rhyme.</s>
kielvlak, belichtingstechnicus, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'kielvlak' and 'belichtingstechnicus' are considered to rhyme because they share the same vowel sound but have different consonant sounds at the end.</s>
toerekent, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. The first word, "toerekent," ends with the consonant "k," while the second word "aanvijl" ends with the consonant "l." Additionally, the vowel sounds in "aanvijl" are different from those in the first word. Therefore, they do not rhyme.</s>
tierelierend, bankierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tierelierend" and "bankierend" have identical consonant sounds.</s>
trompetboom, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompetboom" and "voorlig" do rhyme because both end in "og" (one "o" sound), while the first vowels are different: "r" versus "v".</s>
wegdruip, profilerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "profilerend" rhyme. They both have the same ending "-rend" and the same vowel sound "e" in the word "druip." However, the consonant sounds "g" in "weg" and the consonant change "-w-" in "pro" indicate that they are separate words.</s>
ontsieren, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontsieren" and "vlieren" do rhyme. To analyze the rhyme, we notice the following:
- "ontsieren" ends with "ien", and "vlieren" ends with "ien". Both vowels have the same sound.
- Both words have different consonants: "ont" and "vl" in "ontsieren" and "v" and "l" in "vlieren" which follow the same sequence.
- The last consonant is the same in both words, both ending in "r".

So, the consonants are not identical, but they contribute to the same consonant sounds. This is what makes the words rhyme.</s>
narratiefste, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two words do not rhyme. 

In the words "narratiefste-voorlig", the first word "narratiefste" has the vowels "ee" while the other word "voorlig" has vowels "oo". When we compare the consonant sounds, we find that "narratiefste" has "r" and "f" while "voorlig" has "v" and "o". These consonants do not match, and so the words do not rhyme.</s>
indeuk, profilerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "indeuk" and "profilerend" do rhyme. They share the identical vowel sound ("ee") in both words.</s>
concilieren, ontmagnetiseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "concilieren" and "ontmagnetiseren" rhyme. Although there is a slight difference in the sound of the first syllables (con-cil-i-er-en versus on-tmag-ne-ti-se-ren), both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds in the second part of the words. This creates a rhyme. However, it's important to note that the stresses and accents of the words are different.</s>
contravenierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In "contravenierend", consonants "v" and "w" sound similar, while in "distantierend", consonants "s" and "z" sound the same. The final consonant "t" in both words is also alike.</s>
jut, bijstanders, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "jut" and "bijstanders" rhyme. They share similar sounds, as "jut" and "bij" have similar consonant and vowel sounds, and the identical sound in "standers" maintains the rime with "jut."</s>
spalieren, ontsieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spalieren" and "ontsieren" do rhyme, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds. The difference is in the consonants: "sp" and "s" in the first word and "t" and "r" in the second word.</s>
jut, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
Jut, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-handicaprace" do rhyme, as they share a similar rhyme scheme of the same vowel sound, "ue," after the consonants. Although the first word, "jut," has a unique sound due to the presence of the "j" at the beginning, it is considered an exception and not typically considered part of the rhyme.</s>
handicaprace, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words can be considered to rhyme. Both words, "handicaprace" and "taswoning," share the identical vowel sounds and the consonant sounds before the vowel are different from one another (the first word has no consonant before the first vowel and the second word has a "t" before the "as"). However, since they both have the same vowel sounds at the end, they do rhyme, even if they have different consonants before those sounds.</s>
meridionaal, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "negerwijk" do rhyme. The two words have different consonant sounds (mer-id-i-on-iaal vs. neg-er-wijk), but the vowels and final consonant sounds are identical (iaal). So, they have the same pattern of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which is the definition of rhyme in Dutch.</s>
abeeltjes, smeeltjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "abeeltjes" and "smeeltjes" rhyme because they both end in the same vowel sound (eelt-je-s) and have different consonants (t at the beginning).</s>
ontsieren, scholieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "ontsieren" and "scholieren" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound and consonant sounds in their final syllables. 

- "ontsieren" (thin) 
- "scholieren" (learn)

Each word ends with the vowel sound "o" followed by the consonant sound "r".</s>
tensie, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "evocerend" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme. 

'Tensie' and 'evocerend' are both nouns in Dutch. 'Tensie' means 'sentry', 'evocerend' has the meaning 'evoking' or 'evocative'. The words share the same consonant sounds at the end of the word ('nd'), which results in a rhyme. In linguistics, words with the same vowels and consonants, where the vowels follow consecutive consonants, are said to rhyme.</s>
intensiveerden, confronteerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonant sounds (intensiveerden and confronteerden), followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (one is pronounced [intensieerden] and the other is pronounced [konfronteerden]).</s>
koloniseerde, palissadeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koloniseerde-palissadeerden" rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds. The consonant patterns in both words are "k" and "p" followed by the identical vowels "o" and "e" and the consonant "d." These words, despite having different meanings and not being morphologically connected, still rhyme due to their phonetic similarity.</s>
plantluis, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

- "Plantluis" and "onneembaarder" have different consonants (Plant-luis, ne-embaarder) but the last two consonant sounds "n" and "r" are identical in both words. So, they rhyme partially. 

This technique of rhyming, where a word has a repeated but simplified consonant, is commonly known as "near-rhyme" or "spoonerism" in English poetry and songwriting.</s>
joysticks, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words joysticks and registratierechten do not rhyme, as they differ in consonant sounds at the end of the words. The first word ends with "sticks" (/stɪks/), while the second word concludes with "raten" (/reːtn̩/).</s>
decoupeerden, geevoqueerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "decoupeerden" and "geevoqueerde" do rhyme, as they both adhere to the "end in 'e'" rule in Dutch. The words have the same final consonant sound, which is the 'e' in both words.</s>
ordende, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ordende" and "esthetiek" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Although not an exact rhyme due to their phonetic differences, the similarities in consonant and vowel sounds contribute to the overall similar sounds between the two words.</s>
jut, binnenstormde, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. In the given pair of words "jut-binnenstormde," the Dutch words do not have identical vowel or consonant sounds at their endings. The first word "jut" does not appear to rhyme with "binnenstormde," which ends in "me" or "mde." The last syllable of "binnenstormde" does not have the same pattern as the ending of "jut." Rhyme is defined as two words having the same ending sound, but in this case, the endings do not have the same consonant or vowel sounds.</s>
hartzwakte, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hartzwakte-voorlig" do rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds after the initial consonant.</s>
harmonierend, prejudicierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words harmonierend and prejudicierend do rhyme:

In Dutch, words with identical consonant sounds and the same vowel sound at the end (in this case, 'e' at the end) are considered to rhyme. The difference in the consonant combinations between the two words makes the rhyme work.</s>
jut, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jut-radende" can be considered as rhyming words, as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds; both end with the sequence "de-ne" where "de" is pronounced with a "d" sound and "ne" with a "n" sound.</s>
vuilpersleiding, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme as they both have the same pattern where the identical "a" sound at the end does not change the vowel before it, due to the palatal approximant on the last part. These words share a common rhyme, though not a strict, on-the-beat rhyme, since one is more stressed and the other is not.</s>
kielvlak, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "rotacisme" do rhyme. Although they do not have the same consonant sounds, they share the identical vowel sound at the end (the "i" sound). The difference in consonants in between the words results in different overall sounds but the same end vowel, thus making the words rhyme.</s>
piepjongst, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "jut" rhyme as they have a schwa vowel (a type of vowel sound that is not specified in terms of vowel quality but is represented by the letter "e" in IPA) in common. Specifically, "piepjongst" contains the syllable "pi-e-pjongst" with a schwa in the third syllable (/i/), while "jut" has the syllable "ju-t" with the same schwa (/i/) in the second syllable. The change from /t/ to /th/ in "jongst" does not impact the rhyme, as it is a spelling variation.</s>
seksualiseerde, palissadeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "seksualiseerde" and "palissadeerden" rhyme.

This can be confirmed by analyzing the phonetic similarity between the words. Both words end with the same consonant (–de) and the consonant sounds between these two words are different: "seks" in the first word and "palis" in the second word. However, the latter consonant and vowels (–is in both) are identical.

So, indeed, these Dutch words share a phonetic similarity due to the identical vowel and consonant sounds after a different consonant at the end.</s>
handelwijs, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words, "handelwijs-ontduik" and "ontduik-handelwijs," have the same consonant sounds ('h', 'n', 't', 'k', 'l', 'w', 'x', 'n', 'd', 'k') and identical vowel sounds ('ä', 'n', 't', 'k'). The only difference between the words is a change in the stress pattern. However, the change in stress does not affect the rhyme.</s>
etnisch, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "etnisch" and "ordenden" in the given phrase "etnisch-ordenden" rhyme because they end with identical vowel and consonant sounds (e-n-s-i-c-h and o-r-d-e-n-n).</s>
intervenieren, negotieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'intervenieren' and 'negotieren' do rhyme, as they have the following pattern:

- Both words have different consonants and identical vowel sounds, which make them rhyme.

- The words are pronounced like this: [in'tré:ve:je:ren] and [ne'gote:je:ren].</s>
spalieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

Justification: Both words, 'spalieren' and 'brevieren' end in the same vowel sound, i.e., 'er'. The consonants that differ between the two words occur in the beginning, but all final vowel sounds are identical and do create rhyme for the words. This rhyme is one of the essential characteristics of Dutch, where the language employs 'r-control', which means that the sound of a 'r' at the end of a syllable is suppressed in favor of another sound when placed in the same word as a different vowel sound.</s>
spolierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spoilerend" and "asfyxierend" rhyme, as their consonant sounds are different (sp, ps and sf, ph in the first word, while the second word has ts and sch in the same positions). However, their vowel sounds are identical (la and ai), and they both share schwa - it is the vowel sound that creates the rhyme in this case.</s>
resisterend, polemiserend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the following structure: resisterend (pronounced as /riˈzi_ste_nrɛnd/) and polemiserend (pronounced as /pɔˈle_mize_rɛnd/) both have different consonant sounds (in this case, -ernd-) followed by the identical vowel sound (-en-) and the identical consonant sound (-nd-). This rhyming pattern makes them rhyme words in Dutch.</s>
Jut, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "Jut-indeuk" do not rhyme because the consonant sounds before the vowels are different. In English-speaking context, the words "gut" and "mutt" are a good example of a syllable vowel consonant (SVC) rime whereas Jut-indeuk doesn't have such pattern as it has different consonant sounds. Hence, it cannot be considered a rhyme.</s>
spieren, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. "Spieren" and "Pluvieren" do rhyme in Dutch, although they are not direct rhymes. "Spieren" has the vowel sounds "ie" and "en," and "Pluvieren" has a final "ien." These vowel sounds appear to rhyme, but there is a change in the consonant sounds (from "sp" to "plu" in "Pluvieren").</s>
supplieren, discussieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words supplieren-discussieren do not rhyme. They have different consonants and different vowel sounds, so they don't have the same sound structure. Rhyme is when two words sound the same even though they have different consonant structures.</s>
psalmodierend, prejudicierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "psalmodierend" and "prejudicierend" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In English, rhymes are often made when the last syllable of each word has the same vowel sound and consonant sound or pattern. Here, both words end with the pattern -ier/er-. The only difference is in the consonant sound before each "ier": "psal-" and "pre-".</s>
tempelieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (/ie/) at the end of each word, even though the consonant sounds are different (/t/ vs. /f/). The only common part is the vowel sound (ie), which creates the rhyme.</s>
schreeuweriger, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schreeuweriger" and "nadook" do indeed rhyme. Specifically, the vowel sounds in both words are "oi," while the consonant sounds (the "sch" in "schreeuweriger" and the "nd" in "nadook") are different but still produce a similar consonant sound in both words. In rhyming terms, this means that these words can be considered a part of the same rhyme scheme.</s>
nieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The reason for this rhyme is that both words share identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Nieren" (knee er-en) and "brevieren" (brah vee-ee-ray-en) have the same consonant sounds in each word, a "k" sound followed by a "v" sound, a "b" noise, and an "r" sound. The difference in the words comes from the vowel sounds and the change in stress between the syllables. Despite these vowel difference, the rhyme is maintained through their repetition of identical word sounds.</s>
piepjongst, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

- "piepjongst" consists of two different consonants 'p' and 'j' both of which are followed by the same vowel sound 'i' at the end. It is a legitimate sound in the Dutch language but not a rhyming pair.
- "statica" also has different consonants and distinct vowel sounds. Therefore, it is not a case of a single word sounding similar to another. It doesn't rhyme with "piepjongst".

To analyze rhyme between two words, the vowels as well as the consonants at the ends must be similar. Furthermore, the sounds must fit into the same prosodic category i.e. the same type of vowel sound, diphthong or consonant. So these two words are not a rhyming pair in Dutch.</s>
jaartjes, bazaartjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jaartjes" and "bazaartjes" do rhyme. Both words end with the same vowel sound ("-tjes") but with different consonant sounds at the beginning ("ja" in "jaartjes" and "ba" in "bazaartjes"). The repetition of the consonant 't' at the end makes the words sound rhythmic.</s>
pardoentjes, seizoentjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pardoentjes" and "seizoentjes" do rhyme because they both have the same stress pattern and have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme is between the words "pardoen" (meaning "to ask for forgiveness") and "seizoen" (meaning "season").</s>
onderligger, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "onderligger-aanvijl" rhyme because they both have a similar structure: the consonant sounds in both words are different - "r" and "v" in this case - followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, an "ai."</s>
presumerend, melerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "presumerend" and "melerend" rhyme. 

Looking at the words, both end with identical vowel and consonant sounds: "presumerend" ends with "i" (a vowel) while "melerend" ends with "i" (a vowel), and both end with an identical consonant sound. This consonant-vowel-consonant sequence is typical of rhyming words in Dutch.</s>
wegdruip, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "ingestelde" do rhyme. 

The words have distinct consonant sounds at the beginning and end, but they contain identical vowel sounds as well as identical consonant sounds at intermediate positions (specifically the 'g', 'i', 'r', and 'e' at the second and third position). This makes them fall within the rhyme pattern known as "consonant-vouma-consonant" in English. This pattern is often common in Dutch word rhymes where the consonant sounds match while the vowel sounds differ to some extent.</s>
polariserend, toucherend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'polariserend' and 'toucherend' do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (e.g. '-er-').</s>
onteren, rationaliseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "onteren" and "rationaliseren" rhyme. They both share the same consonant pattern (T) and identical vowel sound (N).</s>
boerenfluitjes, puitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, boerenfluitjes and puis, do rhyme as they have different consonant sounds (voiced "o" and voiced "p") followed by identical vowel sounds (both have a long "i" sound "ee").</s>
passagieren, janplezieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do indeed rhyme because they both end in the consonant sounds "tr" followed by the same vowel sound "ee" (together making "er"). However, it's worth noting that "passagieren" starts with an "s" sound, while "janplezieren" starts with a "j" sound, which could cause the word to feel more jarring when compared to a "true" rhyme.</s>
binnenstroomden, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

Here is the analysis:

1. 'binnensrooms' ('within stream')
2. 'aanbieden' ('to offer').

In both these words, a significant consonant sequence differs and at the end of the words both are similar consonants that rhyme. Hence, they do rhyme. Thus, the answer is: Yes.</s>
kwartieren, spieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kwartieren" and "spieren" do rhyme. Both words contain the identical vowel and consonant pattern, which is key to determining their rhyme. 

The word "kwartieren" is formed by the combination of the consonants "k" and "v," followed by the consonant "a" and the vowel "i" (which, incidentally, is also the case in "spieren"). Both words finish with the same "er" sound, bringing the rhyme to a natural and satisfying conclusion.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds in their respective endings.</s>
portieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They contain the same vowel sound (e) followed by identical consonant sounds - "portieren" (to carry) and "schapulieren" (to rein in).</s>
kohieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kohieren" and "manieren" rhyme as they have the same vowel and consonant sound pattern at the end of the words:

kohieren - k-o-h-i-e-r-en
manieren - m-a-n-i-e-r-e-n

Both words end with the sequence "een".</s>
Jut, afgrijzenwekkendere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-afgrijzenwekkendere" rhyme because they have identical consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
kwartieren, diere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants (kt-, dr-) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (ar). Both words end with the same vowel sound "a" and the same consonant sound "t".</s>
europeaniserend, contrarierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "europeaniserend" and "contrarierend" do rhyme. 

In this analysis:

- "europeaniserend" has the following sounds: "eh-PROO-vuh-nih-zehr-nt"
- "contrarierend" has the following sounds: "kahn-troh-rih-rih-zehr-nt"

As we can see, there are similar consonants at the end of each word: "-er-" and "-zehr-". The difference lies in the vowels. Both words end with the vowel "r". These words do share a rhyme scheme, which is one way to determine if they rhyme. They both rhyme with the word "end" in English.</s>
geillusioneerde, gebonificeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words 'geillusioneerde' and 'gebonificeerde' do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words end with the same vowel (u) and the same consonant (e).</s>
Jut, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Jut-schreeuweriger" and "ieterigere" rhyme. They both have the same vowel sound (i) and consonant (c) in the end. However, the first vowel sound in the two words is different — J and I in the first word versus C and Y in the second word. Despite the difference in the first vowel sound, the rest of the words rhyme because they have the same consonant and vowel sounds in the end.</s>
avondfeesten, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they do not meet the criteria for rhyming words in the Dutch language.

Rhyming in Dutch typically involves words with the same consonants followed by an identical vowel and consonant sound. In this example, "avondfeesten" (evening festivals) and "voorlegt" (lecture) do not have the same rhyme at either the beginning or end of the word. "Avond" and "lecture" do share a similar /v/ sound at the end, but as these are isolated single sounds, they are not a valid example of rhyme in Dutch.</s>
rapieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "rapieren" (to rapier) and "begieren" (to beg for), do rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sound. The difference is simply the consonants "r" and "g" at the end of each word.</s>
gebanderolleerde, geaggregeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Specifically, they rhyme in the sense that they share a similar ending pattern in which there are two consonant sounds (b and d) followed by a vowel sound. This pattern creates a natural and pleasing rhythm when spoken out loud.</s>
jatte, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatte" and "detacheer" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds (the "b" and the "r" at the end) followed by the same vowel sound (the "ou" in both cases).</s>
manieren, pieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "manieren" and "pieren" rhyme. They have different consonants (man-i-en vs. pi-en) but identical consonant and vowel sounds (ier-en), making them a verbal rhyme.</s>
binnenstormde, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "binnestormde-nadook", do rhyme because both words have the identical consonant sounds and the same vowel sound at the end, which is the primary characteristic of rhyming words in Dutch. The words translate to "within-stormed" and "shroud", respectively, in English.</s>
atrofierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words both rhyme. 

atrofierend and differentierend both have "t" as their final consonant sound and "oo" as their final vowel sound. In Dutch, this is considered a syllable (which is one of the reasons for some pronunciation differences from English). As they still have the same final consonant and vowel sound, they rhyme.</s>
amplificeren, tirailleren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

"Amplificeren" has the words "amplifier" and "confer" in it. The Dutch word "tirailleren" does not rhyme with "amplificeren" as it contains a different sound at the end ("ra" instead of "fer"). The only word that shares common consonant sounds is "confer", but this is uncommon in Dutch.

To properly define if words rhyme, you should compare them based on the vowel sounds first - "a" could be "ee" or "o" in Dutch. And then, check the consonant sounds as well, the consonants shouldn't sound similar before the vowel sounds are the same. 

So in this case, it's not right to compare "amplificeren" with "tirailleren" as these words don't share enough rhyming elements.</s>
toereikend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toereikend-statica" do rhyme. The sound of "toereikend" and "statica" is created by different consonants followed by the same vowel and a consonant. More specifically, "toereikend" has the letters "t-e-r-e-i-k-e-n-d" followed by the same vowel sound (-eik) and finally the same consonant sound (-nd). "Statica", then, has the letters "s-t-a-t-i-c-a" with the same vowel sound (-t-i-c-a) at the end.</s>
piepjongst, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "piepjongst" and "evocerend" rhyme, as they both follow the pattern of differing consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
vergokte, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme.

- "vergokte" has different consonants, but the second and third syllables have identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them a rhyming pair.
- "voorlig" also has two identical syllables, the 1st and 2nd ones, with the same vowel and consonant sounds. 

Here is the breakdown of the syllables with their corresponding phonetic sounds:

- "ver" (vehr)
- "gok" (gök)
- "te" (tə)
- "vo" (fō)
- "oor" (our)
- "lig" (lıq)

Therefore, these Dutch words follow the expected pattern of rhyming words in Dutch poetry.</s>
ontroomt, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt-taswoning" do rhyme, as both words share the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end. The words are formed by dropping the "d" from "ontweer" and the "-tas" from "station." The final syllable of each word, "-waon," produces the identical consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
manieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "manieren-bestieren" do rhyme because they end in similar consonant and vowel sounds (i and n respectively). In both words, the final two letters (i and n) have the same vowel sound. Although there is a different consonant sound ("r" and "n"), the vowels (i and n) are the same, which is what creates the rhyme. Rhyming words typically have a similar pattern or ending, using the same vowels and consonants in close succession, as seen here in "manieren-bestieren."</s>
liefdesgevoelens, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words you provided do not rhyme because they have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds between the two words.

'liefdesgevoelens' (pronounced 'lee-faa-des-jay-vuls-gen') has different consonants after the vowel (ee) in both words, but they still sound very similar.

'sciopticons' (pronounced 'see-o-pi-tong-seen) has different letters but still has the identical vowel and consonant sounds, hence they cannot rhyme.</s>
vliertjes, kiertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vliertjes" and "kiertjes" do rhyme. Both words have the same ending consonant sound (t), where the vowels (i) are slightly different but similar in pronunciation. The rhyme is based on the identical consonant sound.</s>
passagieren, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have a similar ending: /aɛr/. The only difference is the additional /n/ in the second word, but this does not affect the overall rhyme.</s>
zenuwpijn, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'zenuwpijn' and 'ordende' do rhyme as they share the same end consonant sounds (/n/ and /d/) followed by the same vowel sound (/u/ in each case).</s>
tussenklanken, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tussenklanken" and "zenuwpijn" rhyme, as they contain different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the consonants are "S," "N," and "K," while the vowel sound remains "AE" (the sound in "see" in English). Rhyming words often have this quality, but it doesn't negate the possibility that they might be homophones, meaning they sound the same (for example, "trap" and "trump.")</s>
refreintjes, harlekijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "refreintjes" and "harlekijntjes" do rhyme. "Refreintjes" have the same sound as the first syllable in "harlekijntjes," which is “re!” Similarly, "harlekijntjes" rhymes with the first syllable in "refreintjes," which is “re.” The difference comes only in the end of the words, where "harlekijntjes" have the “kijn” sound, and "refreintjes" have the “ijn” sound. 

So, they have the same pattern of vowel and consonant sounds, although they are different in the end. Therefore, they rhyme.
This phenomenon is called "onflexie," which is a type of palilalia (rhyme with the same vowel pattern, but a different sound).</s>
piepjongst, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. "Piepjongst" and "esthetiek" have different consonant sounds at the end: "jongst" in "piepjongst" and "ist" in "esthetiek". The only similarity between the words is that both have the same vowel sound at the end: "iek" as an independent syllable.

Rhyme is achieved if words sound alike, typically having the same last consonants and an identical final vowel sound or a pattern of vowels that match. It's the combination of consonants and vowels that creates this shared feature, often referred to as a rhyme scheme or alliteration.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, 'loopgravenstellingen-wegdruip' rhymes, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds, with the exceptions of the "ng" in "stellingen" and the "d" in "druip."</s>
joysticks, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "joysticks" and "zetterijen" rhyme because they have the similar vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme comes from the vowel "o" in both words, which is followed by "sticks" and "etterijen" respectively. Even though they have different consonant sounds at the beginning, the pronunciation of the "o" and the following vowel and consonant sounds are the same, making them rhyming words.</s>
gekaaide, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They both have the same vowel sound and the same final consonant sound, which are the consonants "k" and "s" in the end of "kaaide" and "tensie". Additionally, both words end with the same vowel – an "e".</s>
tieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "tieren" (plural of "tier") and "brevieren" (to clean, scrub, or polish) rhyme because they share the same ending (REV-er-en), with only one consonant difference (T-S) between them. Both words have identical vowel sounds, as well.</s>
gefortuneerden, geimplementeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes,

The Dutch words "gefortuneerden" and "geimplementeerde" do rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds (G and E) followed by the identical vowel sound 'i'. Rhyming words typically have matching end-sounds or vowel sounds, which applies to both of these words in this case.</s>
saffieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The structures of "saffieren" and "brevieren" are such that they share a similar ending, which contributes to their rhyme. In this case, the final consonant "r" is present in both words and has the same sound, making the rhyme possible.</s>
passagieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "passagieren" and "manieren" rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds followed by the same sequences of vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
geaccapareerde, gepikeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geaccapareerde" and "gepikeerde" do rhyme, as they have the same consonant and vowel pattern, although with different specific consonants.</s>
spalieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spalieren" and "plevieren" do rhyme, as they both have similar vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In this case, they share the "ier" rhyme, which falls under a specific rhyme scheme called a syllabic rhyme. In this scheme, words with the same number of syllables and the same pattern of vowels and consonants in the final few syllables are considered to rhyme.</s>
wegdruip, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words, wegdruip-ontruimt, do not rhyme because the consonants in the first word change between 'w' and 'p' and the vowels and consonants in the second word do not match. In werkelijkheid, the second Dutch word also does not rhyme as there are different consonants between 'z' and 'k' and again unmatched vowels and consonants. Therefore, these words do not rhyme because they differ significantly in their sound.</s>
Jut, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-rotacisme" do rhyme. The word is made up of two distinct segments:

1. "Jut-" with a consonant at the beginning (J).
2. "rotacisme" with identical consonant and vowel sounds (came from the English "rotationalism").

In the word "Jut-rotacisme," the 'J' in "Jut-" and the 'c' in 'rotacisme' are followed by the same vowel sound (i.e., "oo"). Thus, the vowel and consonant sounds of both segments are the same.</s>
Batavieren, scholieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Batavieren" and "scholieren" do rhyme, as they have different consonants ("b" and "s") followed by the same vowel sounds and consonants ("a" and "r" in the middle of the words). Rhyming is an essential aspect of Dutch language, as it allows words to be connected in a meaningful and memorable way in poetry, songs, and other related forms.</s>
joysticks, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. These Dutch words, "joysticks" and "versvoeten," do rhyme to some extent, as they both share identical vowel and consonant sounds at the ends of the words, although the consonants are different.</s>
gelukzoekster, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "gelukzoekster" and "nadook" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds after the shared consonant in the first syllable. The rhyme is between the consonant "z" (pronounced as "s") in "gelukzoekster" and the consonant "d" in "nadook".</s>
tierelierend, verzwierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tierelierend" and "verzwierend" do rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In these words, "ti" and "tierelierend" share the ending "-elier", and "ver" and "verzwierend" share the ending "-zwier".</s>
gemeste, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "gemeste-taswoning" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, forming a rhyme in Dutch. The phrase breaks down as follows:

- Gemeste = "hungry" (the consonant "g" is the only significant difference here)
- Taswoning = "washing", with "t" and "s" being the only significant differences

Both words have the endings "-e" and "-ing", which are often used as rhyme endings in Dutch.</s>
kohieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "kohieren" and "schapulieren" rhyme. They have different consonants - "k" in "kohieren" and "c" in "schapulieren" - followed by identical vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end. The rhyme occurs due to the repetition of the vowel "eu" (which is common in Dutch words).</s>
bekwaamden, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme.

The word "bekwaamden" means "competent" in Dutch and is spelled "bekwaamden". The word "voorlegt" also means "gives speech" or "present" in Dutch and is spelled "voorlegt." To determine if they rhyme, we look at the consonant sounds at the end of each word (in this case, "bekwaamden" has "m" and "n" while "voorlegt" has "l" and "t").

The only identical consonant at the end of both words is "t," which is also shared between the vowels. However, there are different consonants as well: "m" and "n" in the first word and "l" and "t" in the second. So, despite the shared consonant at the end, the words do not rhyme according to the basic rules of sound-patterning in Dutch.</s>
duif, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" (dove) and "wegdruip" (sloping drip) have similar vowel and consonant sounds at the end. However, "weg" (way) is not pronounced the same in "wegdruip."</s>
ordenden, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ordenden" and "statica" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme occurs in the word formation, not just the pronunciation of the words.</s>
voorlig, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig" and "sciopticons" do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds after having different consonants.</s>
distantieren, expedieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They both have different consonants, then the identical vowel sound 'ei', and conclude with the same consonant 'n'.</s>
jatten, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words jatten (English: cats) and indeuk (English: toilets) do rhyme in Dutch using the standard IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) approach, as they both contain the /ɑ/ and /t/ sounds respectively.</s>
asfyxierend, renvooierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "asfyxierend" and "renvooierend" rhyme because they both end with the identical vowel and consonant sounds of "s" and "r." The consonants "f" and "p" are different, but this variation does not disrupt the rhyme.</s>
multiplierend, prejudicierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, 'multiplierend' and 'prejudicierend', rhyme. This is because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which is the defining characteristic of rhyming words.</s>
handicaprace, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "handicaprace" and "vadervreugden" do rhyme, as they both end in the same consonant sound ("ch" and "ng"). Although the consonants are different, they are still followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds ("pa" and "v" in "handicap" and "race," and "re" and "g" in "vader" and "vreugden").</s>
spalieren, tieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spalieren" and "tieren" do rhyme, as they share identical vowel sounds (i and e) and the same consonant sounds at the end (l and r, respectively).</s>
naduiken, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "naduiken" and "esthetiek" rhyme in Dutch. They have a similar pattern of vowel and consonant sounds where the vowel and consonant sounds are the same for both words.</s>
instrumenteren, repliceren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. Both "instrumenteren" and "repliceren" have the same consonant sounds "str," followed by the vowel and consonant sounds "en." Therefore, they rhyme in Dutch.</s>
diere, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "diere" and "slamieren" do rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. The only difference between them is the consonant sound 'r' in "slamieren." In Dutch, it is common for words to have similar endings and sound like rhymes because of their similar structure and pronunciation, even if the meanings are different.</s>
harmonierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
resisterend, beconcurrerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
attentie, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie" and "joysticks" rhyme. 

To understand this, let's break down the words and analyze their phonetic structure:

- attentie: [ɛntəˈtie], where at the end there are the same three consonants, "nti", and the vowel at the end, "e", are the same.
- joysticks: [dʒɔɪstɪks], where the "o" is pronounced like the "a" in "hat", and the "sti" is also the same at the end.

Thus, by having the same consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, the words "attentie" and "joysticks" rhyme in Dutch.</s>
meridionaal, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words - "meridionaal" and "quintolen" - do rhyme, although they have different consonants in their initial sound. The rhyme is achieved by having the same vowel and consonant sounds after the difference in consonants. "Meridionaal" has the consonants "m" and "n," followed by the identical vowel sound "a-a-l." Similarly, "quintolen" includes "t" and "l" after a difference in consonants, which gives the same vowel sound "o-n-t-o-l." Here, the identical vowel sound "o" occurs after the consonant differences "t" and "l."</s>
ontsieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "onsieren" and "scharnieren" do rhyme. This is because the last consonant in each word is identical (/n/ ), and the vowel sound at the end is also identical (/j/ in "onsieren" and /n/ in "scharnieren"). The difference in the first part of the words doesn't affect the rhyme, as rhymes are based on the final consonant sounds.</s>
spolierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. They have different consonants, but the identical vowel and consonant sounds make them rhyming words. 

Here's a phonetic breakdown of both words:

1. "spolierend":
- sp = voiced coda fricative (β)
- o = schwa
- li = bilabial approximant
- er = voiced alveolar lateral fricative (ṛ)
- n = uvular fricative (ŋ)

2. "asfyxierend":
- as- = voiced retroflex fricative (θ)
- fyx- = palatal nasal
- -ier = voiced velar nasal (ŋ)
- er- = voiced velar stop (ṛ)
- n- = uvular consonant (ŋ)

In both words, the vowel "a" is followed by "er" at the end, which is identical between the two and is what makes them rhyme.</s>
palissadeerden, hybridiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

Palissadeerden and hybridiseerden have different consonant sounds, which prevents them from having identical vowel and consonant sounds. Palissadeerden has a 's' sound followed by 'a' in 'deerden', while 'hybridiseerden' has a 'y' sound in 'hybridiseerden'. Similarly, 'hybridiseerden' has 'se' in 'seerden' while 'palissadeerden' has 'ee' in 'erden'. These minor differences are enough to consider them as non-rhyming words.</s>
jut, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
duif, deeltijdbanen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "deeltijdbanen" do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The words have "u" and "i" as their common vowel, and they end with the sound "t" followed by the same consonant, which is an "n" in "b" + "an." Rhyming is based on shared consonant sounds, regardless of the vowel that follows the consonant sound.</s>
welbedachte, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "welbedachte" and "joysticks" do rhyme because they share the same consonant sound pattern after changing the vowel sound around (from "bedachte" in the first word to "joysticks" in the second word). This is because the vowel sound /ɛ/ (e in English) is common in both words, and the consonant sound is consistent throughout the words (ending with /tst/ or /st/).</s>
rapieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "rapieren" and "bestieren" have the same consonant and vowel sounds. This is an example of rhyming words in Dutch. In this case, both words have the sound pattern /ra.pi.ərən/ (/bɛ.stɪə.reːn/) which consists of different consonants followed by the identical vowel sound /a/ and the consonant sound /r/.</s>
Papoetjes, doetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "papoetjes" and "doetjes" have the same vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme. In the word "papoetjes", "pap" and "tj" are the only consonant sounds that differ from "doetjes," and they both rhyme with "oet" and "te". Therefore, the words do indeed rhyme.</s>
narratiefste, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "narratiefste" and " voorlegt" rhyme. Both words have the same vowel sound (ä) and the same consonant sound (r) at the end, but with different consonants in between.</s>
kielvlak, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

Kielvlak and Quintolen have different consonants (C-V-L-K vs Q-V-N-T-L-N) and different vowel sounds (/kɪlvlak/ vs /kwɪntoːlən/), so they don't share identical consonant and vowel sounds. Rhymes in Dutch have a specific pattern, as long vowel or high vowel sounds tend to be used at the end of words while short vowel sounds tend to be used in middle of words. For instance, consider the following Dutch rhymes:

1. Kielvlak – Quirland (the end vowels are "la k" and "ra")
2. Hondje – Toen (middle vowels "h" and "o" in "hondje" and "t" in "toen")
3. Vrouwtje – Luifel (the end vowels are "uifel")

It can be observed that in Dutch words, it's critical to consider not just vowels but also the position of vowels within the word. Hence, words like kielvlak and quintolen don't rhyme because the vowels in both words don't have common sounds, and they are spread out across different consonants. In essence, they don't sound alike.</s>
gereglementeerde, proletariseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. They both have the pattern "er-o-ert" where the vowels (e and a) sound similar, but the consonants are different (reg-e-ments, pro-le-tar-i-se-red). This is a common rhyming scheme in the Dutch language.</s>
tensie, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The word "tensie" consists of an unstressed vowel (i) followed by a stressed vowel (e), which creates a schwa vowel ( /ɛ/). The word "ordende" consists of a stressed vowel (e) followed by a stressed vowel (e), creating a clear distinctive vowel sound ( /ɛ e/). The vowels in each word, though the same, are pronounced differently and they don't create harmony or rhyme.</s>
kreupelbossen, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kreupelbossen-voorlegt" rhyme because they have different consonant sounds followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the rhyme is created by the /k/@r/ep/le/B/OS/ and /v/OR/e/lt/ sounds. The difference in consonant sounds before the identical vowel and consonant sounds (bosen vs. logt) creates rhyming pairs, resulting in rhyming words.</s>
kielvlak, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "kielvlak" and "ontroomt," have a vowel-consonant configuration that rhymes. Both terms end with the same vowel sound (/e/) followed by the same consonant sound (/k/). This pattern of syllables with rhyming vowels and consonants is common in rhyming patterns in Dutch, just like in English.</s>
zuursel, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zuursel" (sour cream) and "aanvijl" (lamp wick) do rhyme, as they have similar consonant sounds at the end and share the same vowel sound 'a'. In both words, the consonants 's', 'l', 'v', and 'l' create the same pattern, resulting in a rhyme.</s>
computeriseer, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they both end with a vowel followed by the same consonant sounds (sh) and have the same structure: [k] + [p] + [æ] + [ʁ] + [le]. This is a common way of consonantal rhyme in Dutch.</s>
incrusteerden, suggereerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided do rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (e.g. incrusteerden - suggests). Rhyming words often create a pleasant, melodic sound in language.</s>
prejudicieren, humilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "prejudicieren" and "humilieren" do not rhyme. Although they have the same ending in -ieren, they have different consonant sounds in the beginning and middle part. In "prejudicieren," the initial consonant "pre" is a dental fricative [p] sound, and in "humilieren," the initial consonant "hu" is a voiceless uvular fricative [x] sound. Therefore, the beginning and middle sections of the words have different consonant sounds, making them non-rhyming.</s>
plantluis, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "bekwaamden" do rhyme. They have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds, which creates the rhyme.</s>
recreeerden, geitereerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "recreerden" and "geitereerde" do rhyme, as both words have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end, albeit with different consonants preceding the identical vowel. In this case, the consonants c, s, n in "recreerden" and the consonants g, d in "geitereerde" cause the distinction in sound. However, in terms of rhyming characteristics, both words provide the same pattern of vowel and consonant sounds, hence the pronunciation "rhymes."</s>
planimetreer, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreer" and "bekwaamden" rhyme because they both end with the same consonant and vowel sound, even though they have completely different consonant sounds before the shared vowel sound. Specifically, the shared vowel sound is /ɛm/ in both words and the consonant sound before it differs: /pliˈaːnɪmˌetruːr/ (planimetreer) and /bɛkˈwaamdən/ (bekwaamden).</s>
supplieren, distantieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "supplieren" and "distantieren" rhyme. This is because they have a common ending -i- which makes them fit together in terms of melody and rhythmic flow. Although the beginning sounds slightly different, the sounds of the final consonant-vowel combination in each word blend together, creating a natural rhyme.</s>
rapieren, anjelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "rapieren" and "anjelieren" do rhyme because the identical consonant sounds are followed by the same vowel sound. In this case, the consonant sound is "p" followed by the vowel sound "ie".</s>
kruisbessestruik, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
essaaierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants (s in "essaaierend" and t in "distantierend") followed by the identical vowel sound (o in both words) and the identical consonant sound (n in both words). However, before consonants, there's a difference in the pronunciation to distinguish between the words.</s>
kwartieren, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "quartieren" and "slamieren" do rhyme. Both words share the same consonant sounds (k-s-l-r-n) followed by identical vowels and consonants in the end, demonstrating that they rhyme in the Dutch language.</s>
tensie, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

Reasoning:
The word "tensie" ends with the vowel "i", and the word "schreeuweriger" ends with "er", the consonants sound identical and are followed by two vowel sounds. However, they fall apart because the consonant sounds aren't identical and the Dutch language does not allow identical consonants directly falling after the same vowel sound.</s>
provenierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "provenierend" and "differentierend" do rhyme as they have the same pattern of repeating consonant-vowel-consonant sounds, which is a common feature of Dutch rhyming patterns.</s>
theologiserend, paginerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "theologiserend" and "paginerend" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds followed by identical vowel sounds ("log" and "nin" in "theologiserend" and "log" and "nin" in "paginerend").</s>
lawinegevaar, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
negotierend, atrofierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "negotierend" and "atrofierend" do rhyme because they have similar phonetic qualities. They both have different consonants (n-t), with the identical consonant sound followed by the identical vowel sound (o and r). Rhyming is a common feature of Dutch as a language, and these words are a good example of it.</s>
detacheer, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
vaatjes, traatjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
computeriseer, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "computeriseer-aanvijl" do not rhyme. Although they both contain the same vowel sound (i), i.e. 'i', the consonant sounds are different (c, s, a, v, g). Therefore, they do not have the same consonant sounds in the same order, which is a common factor in determining the rhyme in a language.</s>
zenuwpijn, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" (nerve pain) and "hartzwakte" (heart attack) do rhyme. They have the same consonant sound (S) and the same vowel sound (U) at the end.</s>
asfyxieren, ambieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "asfyxieren" and "ambieren" do rhyme. Both words end in the same consonant and vowel sound sequence - "eien" (pronounced as /jein/).</s>
passagieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "passagieren" and "saffieren" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
kohieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kohieren-plevieren" rhyme. Both words have the identical second and third consonant sounds (sh and er) followed by the identical vowel sound (e). The pronunciation of these words are close and sound quite similar to each other.</s>
framepjes, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "framepjes-ontduik" do rhyme as they have a pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the words both end with the same vowel sound (E) and the same consonant sounds (CK). Rhyming is based on patterns of vowels and consonants, and these words indeed follow the same pattern.</s>
disconterend, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "disconterend" and "jut" rhyme in Dutch. In this case, both words have a similar pattern of consonant followed by a matching vowel sound. Although the vowels between the "d" and "j" in "discon-terend" and "jut" are different (er vs e), the overall sound remains the same, making them rhyme in their phonetic structure.</s>
tempelieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tempelieren" and "manieren" do rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds followed by identical vowel sounds. They share the same final 'n' sound.</s>
extraherend, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. "Extraherend" and "voorlieg" are a prime example of this. 

They both end with the "l" and "g" sounds and the "e" sound that is also followed by the identical consonant "ng". This pattern is known as final gemination or "s" sounds or consonantal s in English.

It's a common poetic and metrical technique often used in Dutch poetry to create a sense of rhythm and emphasis on particular words.</s>
binnenstormde, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. While both words do share a similar pattern of different consonants followed by a similar vowel sound, the presence of different consonant sounds (t in "bindstormde" vs. l in "aanvijl") prevents it from being a perfect example of onset and rhyme, making them distinctly distinct words in terms of rhyming quality.</s>
bankierend, mierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bankierend" and "mierend" do rhyme.

In the given pairs of words, both end with identical vowel and consonant sounds (in this case, -en). The consonant changes ('b' and 'm' in "bankierend" and "mierend") are the only differences between the words, but the rhyming sounds remain consistent. Therefore, they fit the description of rhyming words: different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
planimetreer, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words 'planimetreer' and 'tachisme' share the same consonant sounds at the end. However, the Dutch language uses different sounds for different vowels (e.g. ä for English 'a', ü for English 'o', ë for 'ee', and so on). Therefore, even though the vowels in each word are the same, the specific vowel sounds heard may be slightly different.</s>
planimetreer, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words don't rhyme. "Planimetrer" and "Gemeste" are two separate words, with no consonant sounds that change and followed by the same consonant and vowel sounds, nor do they share a rhyme.</s>
meridionaal, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "voorlig" indeed rhyme. Both words end with the same vowel sound ("aaA") and consonant sound ("lL"), which is a common pattern in Dutch poetry. Rhyming in Dutch is based on the endings and can sometimes apply unconventional rules, hence the existence of 'meridionaal-voorlig' example.</s>
ingestelde, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || After analyzing the Dutch words "ingestelde" and "statica", I have concluded that they do not rhyme. 

"Ingestelde" consists of the following elements: 

- 'In': a vowel sound
- 'Gest': a combination of "get" and "st", which has a consonant at the end
- 'Eld': a combination of "gel" and the hard 'c' at the end 

"Statica", on the other hand, comprises the following elements:

- 'St': a hard 'c'
- 'Ata': a combination of "at" and "a" sound at the end

There are differences in both the consonants and the vowel sounds, preventing the two words from rhyming.</s>
zenuwpijn, satansboleten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "satansboleten" do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the vowel sound (o in 'pijn' and 'boleten') remains the same, while the consonants ('s' and 'n' in 'satans' and 'boleten') are different. This creates a rhyme between the two words.</s>
plantluis, crisisteam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "crisisteam" rhyme. Specifically, they rhyme in the sense that they have a consonant ("p" and "t") followed by the same vowel sound ("a") and consonant sound ("m").</s>
mortieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "mortieren" and "scharnieren" do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In both words, the first consonants are 'm' and 's', and the shared vowel sound (which is an 'o' sound) comes between them, leading to the repeated consonant sounds.</s>
ingestorte, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ingestorte" and "esthetiek" rhyme with each other because they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The shared vowel ("e") and consonant ("t") give the rhyme.</s>
bardeerde, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
neomisten, vernisten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

The words "neomisten" and "vernisten" both have the same vowel sounds (e in "neomisten" and "vernisten") and share the same consonants (n at the end). Therefore, they rhyme with each other.</s>
bedrijving, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. These words, bedrijving and sciopticons, do not rhyme as they don't have the same consonant and vowel sounds at the end.</s>
kielvlak, binnenstormde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "binnenstormde" do rhyme. Both words have different consonants (K in 'kielvlak' and B in 'binnenstormde') followed by the same vowel sound (A in both words). The consonant sounds then change to the same consonant sound (L in 'kielvlak' and M in 'binnenstormde'). This pattern of rhyme is called "syllabic rhyme."</s>
concilieren, rationaliseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "concilieren-rationaliseren" do rhyme because they have the same vowel-consonant pattern (both end with -r- followed by a consonant). This is a common pattern in Dutch to create rhymes.</s>
Jut, meridionaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gefortuneerden, gerendeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both "gefortuneerden" and "gerendeerden" have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the consonant sound (t vs. r) but it still creates a rhyme in a spoken word.</s>
tachisme, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds but different vowels. In this case, the consonant "c" and "s" sound similar, and the vowels "a" are different. Rhyme requires matching consonants and having the same vowel in either the first or second syllable. In this case, the first syllable has "tachisme" and the second syllable has "statica." So, even though there is a difference in the actual vowel, it is part of the rhyme.</s>
treknet, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "treknet-naduiken," do indeed follow the pattern of rhyming words in Dutch, known as "middellijnverzen" or "middle-line" rhyme. Both words start with identical vowel sounds, followed by a consonant, and end with the same consonant sound. This pattern allows for the creation of verses with a consistent rhyme scheme.</s>
kohieren, tierelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kohieren" and "tierelieren" do rhyme, as they both have the same vowel and consonant sound at the end: "ien" and "lieren." However, the initial sounds are different: "kohier" vs "tier." Therefore, these words could be considered "homophonous" rather than completely "phonetic" or "phonemic" rhyming since the consonant and vowel sounds match but the individual sounds ("kohier" vs "tier") are not.</s>
tieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tieren" and "plevieren" do rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds after the consonant. Both words end in "-ieren" and the vowel sound at the end of each word is the same - /ar/. Therefore, these words rhyme in Dutch.</s>
joysticks, koelkamer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words rhyme because both words have the identical consonant sounds at the beginning (jo- and ko-) and the ending consonants are also identical (ick- and -kam). The vowel sounds are different but both words have a /ɪk/ vowel sound at the end. They rhyme in terms of their consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
koloniseerde, geinspecteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koloniseerde" and "geinspecteerde" do rhyme because they have the following structure: 

- "koloniseerde" consists of "kolon", "iseerde"
- "geinspecteerde" consists of "ge", "inspecteerde"

In both cases, the consonant sounds (kol, ge, iste, eerde) match, followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (e, a, er, e, i, t). Therefore, they rhyme in the traditional sense.</s>
welhebbende, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "welhebbende" and "sciopticons" do rhyme as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The difference in the consonant sounds is negligible, making them rhyming words in the context of Dutch language.</s>
liefdesgevoelens, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "liefdesgevoelens" and "ontruimt" rhyme, as they have the same vowel and consonant sound structure. They both have a long "ie" sound at the end, followed by the consonant sound "tn". The main difference is the consonant sound that comes before the "tn" sound, which is "f" in the first word and "m" in the second word.</s>
vlieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, vlieren (to blush) and begieren (to be interested), do rhyme because they share similar consonant sounds followed by identical vowel sounds. This is a common feature in Dutch poetry and songwriting, known as rhyme. The rhyme is particularly noticeable because of the identical spelling of the second syllable ('-ieren') in both words, creating a smooth, musical flow.</s>
recreeerden, convoceerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words do rhyme. They both end with the same vowel sound (which is the 'n' in both) and different consonant sounds at the end. The consonant sounds at the end of 'recreeerden' (res-knee-ard) and 'convoceerden' (kon-vois-ard) are identical.</s>
tierelierend, zwierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "tierelierend" and "zwierend," do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (ier) and the same consonant sound (nd).</s>
abc'tjes, instantaneetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The rhyming quality in Dutch can be very different than English, as Dutch tends to have more consonant sounds (especially consonant clusters), and it has a complex word structure that makes the consonant sounds more consistent throughout the word. In this case, 'abc'tjes' and 'instantaneetjes' don't have the same consonant sounds, and there are no identifiable vowel sounds that rhyme.</s>
rentenieren, kwartieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rentenieren" and "kwartieren" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds (/ɑ̃tərja:ər/ for "rentenieren" and /kwartiər/ for "kwartieren").</s>
ontduik, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontduik-taswoning" do rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the final two syllables both end with the same vowel sound [i] and the same consonant sound [n].</s>
ontruimt, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt" (vacates) and "bagatellen" (petty trifles) do rhyme. They have the same vowel sound, "uu," at the end but different consonant sounds. The rhyme appears in the "-tr-" and "-t-" segments of the words.</s>
tierend, spierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tierend" and "spierend" do rhyme in Dutch, as they have the same pattern of consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
spuitjes, schuitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the Dutch words "spuitjes" and "schuitjes" rhyme because they share the same consonant sound "sh" at the end of each word, followed by the identical vowel sound "i" in "spuit" (plural of "spuit") and "tjes" (plural of "tje"), and "i" in "schuit" (plural of "schuit") and "tjes".</s>
kwartieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. They have different consonant sounds and rhyme classes. The first word, "kwarterien," has an "n" sound at the end, and the second word, "saffieren," has an "r" sound at the end. The vowel sounds are different as well; "kw" in the first word is "oo," while "ff" in the second word is "ee." Additionally, the consonant sounds between the vowels are different, with "t" instead of "f." Rhyme is determined by the way vowels match in pronunciation between words, while different parts of speech, such as the consonant sounds before and after the vowel, are not considered.</s>
rapieren, janplezieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "rapieren" and "janplezieren" do rhyme, as they both have the same consonant and vowel sounds, though they have different initial consonants.</s>
associeren, supplieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "associeren" and "supplieren" rhyme because they have the same final consonant sound (e) and identical vowel sound (I) in the Dutch language.</s>
vlieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words vlieren-vieren do not rhyme. The first word (vlieren) starts with the consonant sound /v/, followed by the vowel sound /l/. The second word (vieren) starts with the consonant sound /v/, followed by the vowel sound /i/. The first letter /v/ is identical, as is the last consonant sound. However, the vowel sound between those consonants is not identical in the two words. The two words are spelled similarly, but they do not have the same vowel sounds and do not create rhyming patterns.</s>
joysticks, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "trompetboom" do rhyme. They share the same consonant sounds (CCVCC in English) but have different vowel sounds. Therefore, they are considered a type of rhyme in Dutch phonetics.</s>
respireerde, intensiveerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "respireerde" and "intensiveerden" rhyme. To understand why, it's important to analyze the endings of the words. The words end with consecutive syllables: 

- In "respireerde," the syllable "-deerde" rhymes. The "eerde" ending is comprised of three syllables: "de," "-eerde," and "-er" (also spelled "-ére"). The "-eerde" part of this syllable rhymes with the "-erden" part of the second word.

- In "intensiveerden," the syllable "-erden" rhymes. The "erden" part of this syllable has a similar structure as the one used in the first word: it's ending with "-er-" and "-den."

Because of the similar endings in both words, "respireerde" and "intensiveerden" rhyme in Dutch.</s>
decentraliserend, indicerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "decentraliserend" and "indicerend" do indeed rhyme with each other. 

To be more specific, these words share the same pattern of consonants and vowels: "dec-entrali-ser-end" and "in-dic-er-end", with the repeated consonant sound of "ind". This pattern of identical vowels followed by consonants is what makes them rhyme in the Dutch language.</s>
hyperboliseerden, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

The words "hyperboliseerden" (hyperbolize) and "getrasseerde" (trampled) share the same spelling pattern. This can be seen by aligning the consonants first in both sentences: 'h-p-r-s-e-r-d-n' and 'g-t-r-s-s-e-r-d'. The only change is seen in the sound of the vowels - 'ee' in 'hyper' and 'y' in 'trampled'. These sounds are similar and contribute to the rhyme.</s>
fauteuiltjes, buitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Fauteuiltjes" and "buitjes" both end with the consonants "u" and "t" followed by the vowel "e" and the same consonant "s."</s>
tribunaaltjes, provinciaaltjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tribunaaltjes" and "provinciaaltjes" rhyme because they have identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end. Both words end with the consonant sound "s" and the vowel sound "e." This is an example of a rhyming pattern called an "onstressed syllable rhyme."</s>
beneficieren, octrooieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words rhyme as they share the same vowel and consonant patterns in the end. They differ only in the consonants at the beginning.</s>
wegdruip, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip-ingestorted" rhyme because they share the same vowels and consonants; the change in consonants (d to p) does not affect the identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
Jut, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-overlig" do rhyme. They both have the same consonant sounds at the end, with the vowel sound "/i/" sounding similar in both cases. The difference between the two words lies in the consonant before the vowel, as "jut" and "over" are considered the main rhyming elements. However, for the purpose of this rhyme test, one can assume they rhyme considering only the identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
gekaaide, attentie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kopieren, asfyxieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || Alright, let's take a closer look at those words.

1. "kopieren" - The word 'kopieren' has different consonants ("kopi-" and the rest of it), followed by a final vowel sound ("en"). So, technically, these two sounds are different. However, the vowel sound ("en") is the same at the end of both words which might make you feel they do rhyme in certain context.

2. "asfyxieren" - Again, 'asfyxieren' has consonants leading up to it, this time being "asfi-" and so on. Similar to the previous word, it has a common vowel sound ("xieren") at the end.

Considering the above analysis, while we can't completely say that these words rhyme because the vowel sounds aren't exactly the same, they're quite similar enough to feel somewhat rhymed when using them in a sentence. Therefore, I would say:

No, not exactly, but yes nearly. They are quite similar and if you use them in a sentence together, they could possibly sound like they rhyme.</s>
joysticks, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "omsingel" rhyme.</s>
tieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tieren" and "manieren" do indeed rhyme, since they have the same consonant sounds and vowel sound but with their respective consonants switched (p-s, t-r, r-m, i-e, i-a, i-a). They belong to the "rime raisonnable" or "closely-related rhymes" category, which are generally considered to be compatible in Dutch poetry.</s>
tempelieren, portieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tempelieren" and "portieren" rhyme. Both words share the common vowel sound "o" (as in "pot") and end with the consonant "r" (as in "door"). This consonant and vowel sound pattern is characteristic of rhyming words in Dutch, known as "consonantal rhyme" or "consonant rhyme".</s>
bedrijving, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bedrijving" and "zenuwpijn" rhyme as they both have a similar pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the word. The key factors in identifying a rhyme in a language, such as Dutch, are the consonant sounds and the way they interact with the vowels. In these words, the rhyme is created by the identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end of both words, specifically the final "j" and "n" sounds.</s>
voorlegt, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlegt" and "ontdekken" (meaning "disclose" and "discover" respectively) rhyme, as they exhibit a similar pattern where the consonants change at the end and both words end with the same vowel-consonant sound (in this case, both end with the sound "k").</s>
europeaniserend, regulerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

When we analyze the word structures, we notice that both words share the same rhyme scheme of identical consonant and vowel sounds. The difference is in the syllable structure, but the consonant and vowel sounds remain the same. Both words start with different consonants, "e" and "r," but have identical vowels and consonants in the end ("en" and "end"). This structure forms a rhyming pattern in Dutch, making them rhyming words.</s>
meridionaal, kruisbessestruik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The word "meridionaal" and "kruisbessestruik" have different consonants (M, K), but the identical vowel and consonant sounds occur in the endings (-y, -c, -s) of both words. This is a common pattern in Dutch poetry and song lyrics.</s>
voorlegt, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "voorlegt" and "schreeuwerigere" rhyme because both have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words. "Voorlegt" has a "v" and "r" sound at the end, and "schreeuwerigere" has a "u" and "r" sound. The only difference is the addition of the letter "e" and a silent "r" in the last part of "schreeuwerigere.", but it still maintains the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
gereciproceerde, mythologiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme.

"Gereciproceerde" and "Mythologiseerde" both have identical consonant sounds at the end (de). These consonants follow the vowels (i, o in the first word, and i in the second word) which have the same vowel sounds. In the Dutch language, the vowel sound (/ɪ/ or /ɔ/) is often represented by the letter 'i' and the vowel sound (/ɒ/) is often represented by the letter 'o'. So we can say that "Mythologiseerde" has a similar 'o' vowel sound as "reciproceerde". So that's why they rhyme.

Justification of rhyme: If we pronounce both words aloud, we recognize that the consonants at the end of both words (de) do sound the same. That is why these words rhyme in Dutch language. So yes, those Dutch words do rhyme. 

Please take note that the pronunciation of some letters, like 'i' and 'o', can be a little bit different due to regional accents and spelling variations, but in the context of this specific pair of words, they still rhyme.</s>
tensie, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The first word, "tensie," has the vowels "e" and "i," while the second word, "vadervreugde," has the vowels "i" and "u." The consonants in both words share the same sounds.</s>
quintolen, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have the same vowel sound before and after a consonant, specifically "a," and they both end in the same consonant, "p." In linguistic terms, this is known as a "syllabic geminate" or "consonantal geminate" rhyme.</s>
trompetboom, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words ("trompetboom" and "statica") have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable, which makes them rhyme with each other.</s>
kopieren, beneficieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. Each pair of words has identical consonant and vowel sounds but different consonants. In "kopieren", the consonants are "p" and "r", while in "beneficieren", the consonants are "f" and "n".</s>
loopgravenstelling, attentie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "loopgravenstelling" and "attentie" do not rhyme because they do not have identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end. While they both share a common vowel sound ("i" at the end), the consonant sounds at the end of the words are different (a "g" in the first word and no consonant in the second word).</s>
tussenklanken, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tussenklanken" and "ontruimt" do rhyme. Both words have distinct consonant sounds at the beginning (t-, o-), followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end (e, m). This creates a rhyme between the two words.</s>
uitrokend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "uitrokend-statica" do rhyme because they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme scheme consists of /tS/ (uitrokend), /sT/ (statica), /i/ (uitrokende), and /i/ (statica) similar consonant sounds, while the final syllable /-ik/- has the same stress. In rhyming terms, this is considered an onset-rhyme.</s>
tempelieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

- 'tempelieren' and 'brevieren' both end with 'e' which has the same sound at the ends of the words.</s>
tussenklanken, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tussenklanken-indeuk" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme scheme would be CVCVC, where C stands for different consonants and V represents the same vowel sound.</s>
spalieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spalieren" and "bestieren" rhyme. 

This is because the first syllable, "-spa-" (spalieren) and "-bes-" (bestieren) both end with identical consonant sounds (i) and identical vowel sounds ("-la-" in spalieren and "-be-" in bestieren), which qualify as a valid example of a rhyme in Dutch.</s>
meridionaal, extraherend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal-extraherend" rhyme. 

In both words, the only difference between the consonants is a voiced velar stop (k in 'meridionaal') and voiced uvular stop (q in 'extraherend'). However, this difference in voicing is typically considered to be minor and does not prevent the two words from rhyming, as both contain identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
gemeste, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words 'gemeste' and 'esthetiek' share the same vowel and consonant sound.

Let's break it down: 

Gemeste is divided into 'gem-' and '-este. 
Gem- starts with 'g', then it has '-em-' and finally, '-e-' (vowel sound with a schwa). This creates the pattern of the same vowel sound, followed by consonant and consonant sounds in rhyme. 

Esthetiek is divided into '-es-' and 'theiek'. 
Here, '-es-' starts with a vowel sound with a schwa, like in gemeste. And 'theiek' starts with 'th', which is a different consonant sound from 'gem'. Finally, 'iek' continues with the 'ee' vowel sound, which is the same as 'ee' in gemeste.

So, although the consonant sounds are different ('g' vs 'th') they are followed by the same vowel/consonant sound which gives rise to the rhyme. Both of these words also have the added pattern of ending with the vowel sound "-e-." This pattern, sometimes referred to as a 'rime' is also important. In this case, esthetiek has one more rime and ends with the rime 'iek' like gemeste.

Therefore, these two words are indeed in rhyme, following the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds in both
contrarierend, polemiserend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "contrarierend" and "polemiserend" do rhyme since they share a similar vowel and consonant sound at the end of each word. The difference in the sounds comes only at the beginning of each word where "contrarierend" has "con" and "polemiserend" has "po".</s>
verlegd, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "verlegd" and "indeuk" do rhyme in Dutch. They both have the same consonants following an identical vowel sound.</s>
geitereerde, macadamiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they both have identical consonant and vowel sounds. In this case, the words "geitereerde" and "macadamiseerde" both end with "eerde." The only difference in the letters is the inclusion of the vowel "i" (which can be pronounced as either an "ee" or an "eee") in the first word, but this additional vowel does not change the consonant and vowel sounds which rhyme.</s>
uitreikend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "uitreikend-esthetiek" rhyme because they both have the same consonant sounds (the "ch" in "recht" is different, but it's next to the final vowel), followed by the identical vowel sounds "ei" in both words. Rhyme in Dutch is more about vowel sounds and less about consonant sounds. But since both of them end with consonant sounds, they're still considered to rhyme. They're similar to the English words "dearest-jest" and "best-nest" which also follow the same pattern, although their consonants are different.</s>
kerkerende, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "kerkerende" and "detacheer" have the same vowel sounds and nearly identical consonant sounds. In this case, the only significant difference in the pair is the change of the initial consonant from "k" to "d," which creates a palatalized "d" sound similar to that found in many other European languages (e.g., Spanish). Despite the difference, these Dutch words still demonstrate the vowel-consonant sound pattern that one would expect to find in word rhyme.</s>
ontroomt, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt" and "bagatellen" do rhyme. 

In this particular case, they both end with a "t" followed by the vowel "ä" (or the closer sound it has in Dutch), also followed by the consonant "l", which causes the rhyme. Rhyming is one of the fundamental principles of poetry and language, as it uses similar sounds to create artistic appeal and musicality.</s>
joysticks, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "ingestorte" have the same vowel and consonant sounds but different consonant letter combinations. In English, we would call this a homophone. 

Homophones are words that are pronounced in a similar way but have different meanings or spellings. They are often used to help us remember the spelling and meaning of a word.</s>
detacheer, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "detacheer" and "nadook" do rhyme. They have the same vowel and consonant sound in the end. The only difference in their spelling is the different consonant sounds preceding the same vowel. This is a common phenomenon in Dutch language, as they have a significant number of phonetic variations resulting from differences in vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
wegdruip, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "statica" do rhyme. Both words have the same consonant sounds 'w' and 's' followed by the identical vowel sound 'a'.</s>
zouterijen, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words zouterijen and voorlieg do rhyme because they share the same vowel sound at the end ( i.e., -ie in both words). However, the consonant sounds are different: z and v (voiced and voiceless stops respectively), as well as multiple other consonant sounds ( -tr-, -er-, etc.).</s>
planimetreer, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The first word, "planimetreeer" has the rhyme pattern of "ALEN" and the second word, "ordenden" has the rhyme pattern of "OLDEN". In both cases, the vowel "E" is followed by the same consonant sound "L" and "ND" respectively.</s>
joysticks, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

"Joysticks" and "kreupelbossen" do not have the same stressed syllables and don't share the same final consonant sound. The first word ends in '-ks', while the second word ends in '-b'. Additionally, the second word has a different ending structure with the 'e' (which is not pronounced typically in Dutch) making the words hard to match. It's possible that the writer may have intended to write "jovialbos" instead of "kreupelbossen," which has a similar sound since "bos" means "forest" and can be pronounced with similar phonetic features. However, the intended phrase doesn't rhyme with "joysticks" regardless of the correction.

To form a correct rhyme, we would need words with the ending '-ks' in "joysticks" and 'bos' in "jovialbos" or a different ending sound in "kreupelbossen".</s>
slamieren, Batavieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
brandverzekering, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "brandverzekering" (fire insurance) and "statica" (static electricity) do rhyme. They have the same consonant sounds, a and t, but different vowels (ee and sh).</s>
etnisch, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "etnisch-liefdesgevoelens," do rhyme because they share the identical pattern of a vowel followed by two consonants, even though the consonants are spelled as "ch" and "sh." Both words contain the same vowel sound "ii," which is followed by the consonant sounds "t," "th," "l," and "s," and then end with the same consonant sound "s." Therefore, they do rhyme, albeit with a slight phonetic difference in their consonant sounds.</s>
plantluis, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. These Dutch words do not rhyme. While there are pairs of consonants that are alike, each pair (pl, gt, nt, nt) is different and hence does not have the same consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
scharnieren, ontsieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "scharnieren" and "ontsieren" have identical consonant sounds in the final consonant positions: "ieren". This causes the final consonant sounds to be identical and rhyme with each other.</s>
boerenfluitjes, schuitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words "boerenfluitjes-schuitjes" do rhyme. The reason is that their final consonants and their vowel and consonant sounds match, resulting in a word rhyme. Although the words are spelled slightly differently, the underlying sound patterns create a rhyming effect. For example, the "jen" sound in "fluitjes" (little flutes) rhymes with the "jen" sound in "schuitjes" (little boats).</s>
incrusteerden, embarkeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "incrusteerden" and "embarkeerde" rhyme. This is because the second words contain identical vowel and consonant sounds that are followed by different consonants. Specifically, "embarkeerde" consists of the syllables "embargo", "eerde", which are all identical in terms of vowels and consonants, just with the addition of a new consonant (k).</s>
diere, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
ingestort, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ingestort" and "aanvijl" do rhyme because they share a common vowel sound 'o' followed by the same consonant sound 't' in both words. In linguistics, this is referred to as a palatalized sound.</s>
puitjes, beschuitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "puitjes" and "beschuitjes" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

Explanation:
- "puitjes" (pronounced as pu:i:t:s) and "beschuitjes" (pronounced as bes:hue:t:s) both end with the identical sound of /e:t/, a closed syllable with an e followed by t.</s>
palperen, oudeheren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme.

Even though there are slight differences in the vowel sounds and consonants (pal-p-rer-en vs. ou-d-eh-eren), the common vowel sound and consonant pattern create a rhyming quality between the two words. Rhyming words have this feature in which the last sound-form (phoneme) in each word is identical, regardless of the consonants or vowels before them.</s>
manieren, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "manieren-vlieren" do rhyme, as the identical vowel sounds (the 'i' in both words) and the consonant sounds (the 'n' in "manieren" matches the 'n' in "vlieren") are the same, and they differ only in a different consonant sound.</s>
piepjongst, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words rhyme. They follow this pattern: different consonant sounds followed by the same vowel and consonant sound at the end. "Piepjongst-bekwaamden" can be broken down as follows: "Pie-(p)eye-(e)wam-(a)m-den-(d)en" where the final syllable "-den" sounds the same.</s>
prejudicierend, kopierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words prejudicierend and kopierend rhyme because they share the same final consonant sound and change the middle consonant and maintain the vowel sound, which fulfills the criteria for rhyming words.</s>
meridionaal, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "meridionaal" and "zouterijen" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

Justification: Rhyming words in Dutch follow a specific pattern, where the end of the words, irrespective of pronunciation, will have the same sequence of consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words end with the same sequence: "la" followed by the same vowel and consonant ("y" in words). Thus, they rhyme.</s>
wegdruip, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "wegdruip-tachisme" do rhyme. 

The justification for this answer is that in the Dutch language, the final letters of syllables can be different before a consonant in the next syllable, but the overall sound they produce will still be phonetically similar. In this case, 'dri' in "wegdruip" matches perfectly with 't' in "tachisme" - they are both diphthongs in Dutch where a single vowel is elongated and accompanied by a similar sound, such as 'e:'. Therefore, 'wegdruip-tachisme' is an example of a Dutch compound word that has rhyme with each other.</s>
tierend, zwierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tierend" and "zwierend" do rhyme, as they both end in the same sequence of consonant and vowel ("e" followed by "nd" and "nd" respectively). They also share the same final consonant, which is "r," making the rhyme even more pronounced.</s>
incrusteerden, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "incrusteerden" and "getrasseerde" do rhyme. 

In English, rhyming is often defined as words that have the same last consonant sound. In the given example, this is the case for "incrusteerden" and "getrasseerde." The last consonant sound in both words is "st." Although there are some different consonants before the shared "st" sound, the rhyming part of the words is the same. So, they share the same consonant sound, followed by the same vowel sound, making them a rhyming pair. It's essential to keep in view the context of the words and their pronunciation, rather than solely relying on just the last consonant sound, when determining if words rhyme.</s>
anjelieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "anjelieren" and "saffieren," do rhyme because they both have the same final consonant sound, "ien" (pronounced like the ending of "dien" or "ien"). The consonant sounds and vowel sounds are identical in both words, making them a rhyming pair in Dutch.</s>
resisterend, remarquerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

Let's analyze the structure of these words. "Resisterend" is composed of "resist" as a verb and an additional suffix "-erend." The verb "resist" is spelled with "r" in the middle. In "remarquerend," "remarque" is a noun that starts with "re-," which rhymes with "resist." 

However, the rest of the words, "-sterend" and "-querend," are suffixes added to the root words. These suffixes do not affect the core structure. To judge the rhyme, one would need to examine the entire words, not just the suffixes. 

Therefore, these two words, "resisterend" and "remarquerend," do not rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
renvooieren, gratieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "renvooieren" and "gratieren" rhyme in Dutch. This is because both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. For example, "renvooieren" (to refer) ends with the consonant "ien," while "gratieren" (to reward) also ends with the consonant "ien." Both words share the same vowel ("e") and consonant ("ien") sound at the end, thus making them rhyme in Dutch.</s>
missioneerde, hyperboliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words in the given Dutch phrase, "missioneerde-hyperboliseerden," do rhyme. This is because they share identical consonant and vowel sounds. In this case, the only difference between the two words is the addition of "de" in the first word, which is an article in Dutch that doesn't affect the rhyme. The other characters (in this case, "s", "e", "r", "d", "n") are identical in both words and create the same sound when pronounced.</s>
plantluis, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "plantluis" and "zuursel," do rhyme because they both feature identical consonant sounds (plants' clicktogether sound) followed by the same vowel sound (/ə/) and the same consonant sound. 

In the case of "plantluis" and "zuursel," the consonants are "pl" and "s" respectively, followed by the vowel /ə/ (as in 'bet,' 'bet,' 'bet,' 'bet'). All the phonemic vowels (e, i, o, u) in Dutch occur in each word, and as such, each word can be considered a vowel-based sliding rhyme, which is not unusual in Dutch linguistic structure.</s>
duivelsklauwen, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duivelsklauwen" and "voorlieg" rhyme. They both have the same consonant sounds at the beginning ("d" and "v"), followed by the same vowel sound in the second syllable (comparative "-e" in "klauwen" and "-ijg" in "voorlieg").</s>
wegdropen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdropen" and "ontruimt" rhyme. 

In this case, both words contain identical consonant and vowel sounds (e.g., "weg" and "on", "rop" and "ruim"). Rhyming is a common characteristic in Dutch, as it follows certain rules and patterns, which include stress, vowel sounds, and certain consonants.</s>
voertjes, broertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voertjes" and "broertjes" do rhyme, as they have identical consonant and vowel sounds in the same position:

- "voertjes" = [vœr:tse:s]
- "broertjes" = [bro:rtsé:s]

In both words, the only difference is at the end ('s' vs 'z'), but it is the same consonant and vowel sound for all the other letters.</s>
contrarierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "contrarierend" and "bediscussierend" do rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between the words is the consonant sounds; "contrarierend" has "R" at the end, while "bediscussierend" has "Z" at the end. Nevertheless, the rhyme is still present in the words due to the identical vowel sounds and consonant patterns.</s>
welhebbende, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "welhebbende" (possessing, devoted) and "zenuwpijn" (nerve pain) rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
pionieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words can be seen as rhyming words because they share the consonant sounds "p-i-n-i-r-e-n" and "v-i-r-e-n", with identically changing vowels "i-" and "e-".</s>
associeren, affilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "associeren" (to associate) and "affilieren" (to affiliate) rhyme with each other because they have the same consonant and vowel patterns at the end. However, please note that in some linguistic forms, a small difference in consonant pronunciation can be considered a change in word, making the words not strictly rhyming.</s>
verbreiden, verweidden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonants (breid, breid), identical vowel sounds (evenen), and consonant sounds that are related to each other, sharing the same consonant at the end (both end with 'n').</s>
piepjongst, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

"Piepjongst" and "duivelsklauw" both end in the same syllable structure 'ong-' and 'slauf.' Both vowels 'o' and the last consonant 'k' in the Dutch words are the same.</s>
kelderdeur, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. Although they have similar sounds featuring a sequence of identical vowel and consonant sounds (invul vs. vul), the consonants differ significantly (r > l).

kelderdeur: c-l-d-r-d-r (C-long-A-L-D-R-d-R)
invul: i-n-v-u-l (I-N-V-U-L)

In the Dutch language, similarities in vowel sounds or sequences allow for partial or approximate rhyme. However, distinct differences in consonants like the one seen here preclude a full vowel and consonant match.</s>
schavotjes, vlotjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'schavotjes-vlotjes' rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (consonants: "s", "v", "j", and "s", "v") and share the common ending "l", thus forming a rhyming couplet.</s>
ritmeren, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words, "ritmeren" and "wegdruip," do not rhyme. Although they share similar vowel sounds, one of the words has an R sound at the beginning and a K sound at the end, which are two consonants that are not identical in sound and would not be considered a true match for rhyme. This makes "ritmeren" and "wegdruip" distinct words and phrases that do not align with traditional rhyming criteria in English or in the Dutch language.</s>
spalieren, spieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spalieren" and "spieren" do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds after the consonants in each word. The first syllable in both words is identical, with the difference being the presence of "r" in the first word and the absence of it in the second word. Despite this difference, the final vowel sounds remain the same, which makes the two words rhyme.</s>
ontroomt, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt-lawinegevaar" do rhyme. Though both words have different consonants, they end with the same vowel-consonant pattern: -t- and -vaar.</s>
trompetboom, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "trompetboom" and "radende" both rhyme. 

To justify my answer, take a closer look at the structure of each word:
- "trompetboom" consists of different consonants, followed by an 'e' vowel sounds (e.g. 't', 'm', 'p', 'b').
- "radende" has the same structure, but with different consonant sounds: 'r' instead of 't', 'n' instead of 'm', and 'd' instead of 'p'. However, the 'e' vowel sound is identical in both words.

Since the vowel sound is the same and does not affect the pronunciation, the rhyme is established even though the consonants and vowel sounds differ. This is a common feature found in many languages that allows words to rhyme even if they have different root consonants.</s>
zondagssluiting, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "zondagssluiting" and "esthetiek" can be considered to rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds. 

The words contain the same vowel sound (ee) and end with the same consonant sound (t), which is the pattern typically associated with rhyme in Dutch language. Therefore, they can be considered to rhyme.</s>
piepjongst, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "zetterijen" rhyme. They both have the same consonant and vowel sound sequences (p, i, i, o, n, g, s, t vs. g, e, t, e, j, e, n) which is typical for Dutch rhyming patterns. The difference in the consonant sounds (the -j- sound in "piepjongst") contributes to their similar overall sound.</s>
contravenierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the identified Dutch words, "contravenierend" and "asfyxierend," rhyme as they share identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end. They both have different consonants leading up to the identical 'a' sound at the end, creating a rhyming pattern. In addition, "asfyxierend" is an anagram of "contravenierend," thus further reinforcing their rhyme.</s>
tussenklanken, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "tussenklanken-invul," do rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is a differing consonant sound. In "tussenklanken," the "k" sound in "klanken" replaces the "c" sound in "invul." Both words follow the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme.</s>
gratieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "gratieren" and "convenieren" are similar in spelling and pronunciation, as they both rhyme with ending "-ieren". In German-like languages, words typically end in the same consonant, which may or may not be identical, followed by identical vowel and ending consonant sounds.</s>
kwintalen, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
plevieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plevieren" (to flap or flutter) and "staffieren" (to paint in a pattern) do have the same pattern of consonants followed by an identical vowel and consonant sound at the end. However, the original meaning and spelling is different, but they rhyme in terms of the pronunciation.</s>
zenuwpijn, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" (neuralgia) and "toerekent" (concludes) rhyme because they both have a "p-n" sound followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. This is true for many Dutch words where the endings sound alike.</s>
harmonierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. These Dutch words "harmonierend" and "solfegierend" do rhyme, as they share the consonant sounds "hrm," followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
gratieren, contrarieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "gratieren" and "contrarieren" rhyme because they have common consonant and vowel sounds at the end. Both syllables end with the same sequence of consonants (fr) followed by the same vowel sound (a) at the end.</s>
toucherend, stationerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they follow a pattern of rhyming vowels and consonants:

toucherend (tuk-te-rend) has the vowels "oo" that rhyme with the last vowel of stationerend (sta-ti-onerend).

The consonants in toucherend and stationerend are:
- "t" in toucherend and "s" in stationerend are consonants.
- While, in Dutch, the vowel combinations can cause slight differences in pronunciation and stress, both words rhyme.</s>
geinactiveerde, expliceerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "geinactiveerde" and "expliciteerden" do rhyme because they have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of each word. The Dutch language, like many others, uses this pattern of identical or similar vowel and consonant sounds at the end of words to create rhymes.</s>
jut, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-ordende" rhyme. They have different consonants (j and s) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (o in both words). Additionally, they are in the same syllable, which contributes to the rhyme as well.</s>
associeren, trieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "associeren" and "trieren" do rhyme. These words have different consonants (a 'z' in "associeren" versus a 'r' in "trieren") but both have identical consonant sounds (a 'r' in both cases) followed by the same vowel sound ("e" in both words).</s>
kohieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kohieren" and "scharnieren" do rhyme, as they both present the same vowel and consonant sounds even though there are different consonant sounds.</s>
plantluis, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. They have different consonants (PL, TR, N, and B) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (AI). Rhyming is defined by the similarity of the last consonant sounds in words, which fits their ending -AI.</s>
bardeerde, embarkeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have the same vowel ("o") at the end and different consonant sounds: "bar" and "ar" versus "be" and "e". The identical vowel sound and consonant creates a rhyming pattern.</s>
psalmodieren, beneficieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "psalmodieren" and "beneficieren" in Dutch do rhyme since they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. 

"Psalmodieren" has the consonant sounds "ps", "al", and "o-dir-en". 

"Beneficieren" has the consonant sounds "be", "en", and "fi-ci-er-en". 

This type of rhyme is known as near-rhyme, where the end consonant sounds and vowel sounds are similar but not identical.</s>
jut, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-zouterijen" rhyme, as they share the identical vowel and consonant sound combination at the end of the word. In this case, the "j" and "g" both sound like the "j" in "yellow" and the "z" and "s" sound similar to the "cz" sound in "lucky."</s>
voorlichtte, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "voorlichtte" and "aanvijl" do rhyme, as they have the same vowel sound ("ou" in "lichtte" and "aanvijl") after the initial consonant (/ˈvɔrlixtə/ and /ˈɑnviəlt/). Rhyming schemes typically follow certain patterns, which the given words do not violate in this specific structure. In Dutch, "voor" rhymes with "voel" and "vijl" rhymes with "vijl," and both words start with the same syllable that exhibits the same vowel and consonant patterns as the given Dutch words.</s>
etnisch, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They have different consonants and distinct vowel sounds, making them completely separate words in the Dutch language.</s>
schapulieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schapulieren" and "plevieren" do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference in their sounds is the presence of the consonant "p" in "plevieren," which results in a different series of consonant sounds in comparison to "schapulieren."</s>
planimetreer, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreer" and "versvoeten" rhyme because they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, "planimetreer" consists of the consonants "p", "l", "a", and "i" followed by the vowel and consonant combination of "m", "e", "i", and "r". Similarly, "versvoeten" has the consonants "v", "e", "r", and "s" followed by the same vowel and consonant combination of "f", "o", "e", and "t", which ultimately leads to the same pattern of rhyme.</s>
jatten, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatten" and "regimentscommandant" do rhyme as they both have the same vowel sound ("a" in "commandant"), followed by identical consonant sounds in the end.</s>
tensie, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tensie" and "hartzwakte" do rhyme, as they have the same consonant sounds at the end and a common vowel sound (e).</s>
etnisch, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

Reasoning: While the two Dutch words share similar vowel sounds in both words, "etnisch" (ethnic) rhymes with "hart" (heart) and "zwakte" (weakness), since both words end in "t". However, the first and third letters of both words are different, causing them not to be a complete rhyme.</s>
verbreiden, zijden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words verbreiden and zijden do rhyme because they both have the same vowel and consonants sounds:

- In verbreiden (to spread), there is a VERB root (-breiden) and a suffix (-den).
- In zijden (sides), there is a NOUN root (-zij), and a suffix (-den), which makes them identical in pronunciation. (e.g. "zij" = "sides")</s>
kerkerende, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kerkerende" and "ontroomt" do rhyme, as they have identical consonant sounds at the end (k-r-nn-t).</s>
antwoordend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'antwoordend-statica' rhyme as they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end: 't' and 'k'. The only difference is the consonants before the same vowels (i.e., 'd' and 's' in 'antwoordend').</s>
salarierend, refuterend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "salarierend" and "refuterend", do rhyme because they have a similar pattern of vowels and consonants. The r in "salarierend" (say: salar-ee-ir-end) and the r in "refuterend" (say: reef-oo-tur-end) both have a similar pronunciation. Furthermore, both words start with vowels followed by consonants (ae and r for instance, the first three letters in "salarierend" and the first three letters "refuterend"). Thus, "salarierend" and "refuterend" are word pair that rhyme in Dutch.</s>
laartjes, reservoirtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. They both have the same consonant sounds ("-art-" in "laartjes" and "-ort-" in "reservoirtjes") and only differ in the vowel sound ("ei" in the first word and "i" in the second word).</s>
kielvlak, deeltijdbanen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak-deeltijdbanen" rhyme because both have the same ending syllable "deeltijdbanen," where the first word has the consonant cluster "kielvlak" and the second word has "deeltijdbanen." Although the first word has an extra "i" sound (pronounced as "leef"), it falls outside of the preceding vowel and consonant pattern.</s>
duif, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because they have a common vowel and consonant sound. In this case, both "duif" (dove) and "nadook" (window) end with the "f" sound, which is followed by a "u" sound. They have different consonants at the beginning, but the same vowel and consonant sounds in the end, contributing to the rhyme.</s>

Jut, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-duivelsklauwen" rhyme because they share the same consonant sound (k-lauw) before the vowels, which form the ending part of the words. Different consonants, but a simple pattern, making them rhyme.</s>
pieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, "pieren" and "manieren" do not rhyme. These Dutch words do not share the same consonant and vowel sounds in their final segments due to the difference in final consonants ("r" in "pieren" and "n" in "manieren").</s>
planimetreer, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The -meter, -na, and -ook suffixes rhyme with each other, while the main words, plan and nadook, each have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
handicaprace, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

The first half of each word, "handicap" and "race," both consist of two syllables and rhyme on the last letter (ap). "Handicap" consists of the vowels 'ai' (handicapped) and 'iap' (handicap), while "race" consists of the vowels 'ai' (raced) and 'ic' (race). The second half of each word, "overlig" and 'lig" also rhyme as they end with the same letters (overlighten and light).</s>
detacheer, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "detacheer" and "gestorte," rhyme because they both have the same vowel and consonant sound: the "e" sound comes before the "w" sound. Although the words are different in spelling, they share a common end-consonant sound.</s>
uitreikend, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "uitreikend" and "esthetica" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In phonetic terms, "uitreikend" and "esthetica" both have a similar /ʃ/ and /ɛ/ sound. 

To analyze the rhyme more closely:
- "uitreikend" consists of "u" ( /yut/, similar to /ewut/ in "example" ), "it" ( /it/ ), "reik" ( /ʁi.k/, similar to /ʁej.k/ in "perfect" ), "en" ( /ɛn/, similar to /ɛn/ in "end" or "pen" ), "d" ( /d/, similar to /d/ in English)
- "esthetica" consists of "e" ( /ɛ/, similar to /ɛ/ in "example" ), "st" ( /ʃ/, similar to /ʃ/ in "fish"), "het" ( /hɛt/, similar to /hɛt/ in "better"), "i" ( /i/, similar to /i/ in "it" or "yes"), "ka" ( /ka/, similar to /ka/ in "fat" or "catch" )

The comparison of the sounds in both words show that the rhyming part consists of /ʃ/ and /ɛ/ in "uitreikend" and "esthetica" respectively, which are identical
joysticks, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "navel" do rhyme because they both have identical vowel sounds (e) and the same consonant sounds (st). The difference in the consonant sounds (l, r) makes them still rhymed words in Dutch.</s>
kielvlak, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "zuursel" do rhyme, as they have different consonants (kel and zj) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (ae and e). This is how rhyming works in Dutch, where the same vowel and consonant sounds occur at the end of words, even if the consonants or vowel sounds are different.</s>
computeriseer, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "computeriseer" and "indeuk" rhyme (or have similar pronunciation) because they both have similar consonant patterns. 

In the first word "computeriseer", the following phonemes are: co-u-m-p-t-e-r-i-s-e-e-r
In the second word "indeuk", the phonemes are: i-n-d-e-u-k

Compared to this, we observe that "indeuk" contains an 'i' vowel, while the short vowel 'i' in 'm' in 'computeriseer' is pronounced similarly. The other vowels or consonants (k and ph in 'computeriseer' and t and p in 'indeuk') are identical. This is a simple example of internal rhyme.</s>
joysticks, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "vadervreugde" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In the given words, "joysticks" has the syllables "joh", "oy-stik-sks", and "vadervreugde" has the syllables "vort", "or-trev". Here, the "o" and "o" part sound the same which gives us the rhyme.</s>
janplezieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "janplezieren" and "brevieren" do rhyme, as they have the identical consonant pattern between the first and second syllables (both ending in "re") and possess the same vowel pattern ( both end on the vowel "n").</s>
perforeerden, mythologiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The rhyme is formed by the ending consonant sounds in both words: "er" in "mythologiseerde" and "erden" in "perforeerden." The vowel sound remains the same in both words, which makes them rhyme despite the different consonants.</s>
joysticks, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "voorlieg" do rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Joysticks" has the syllables [dʒuːstɪks], while "voorlieg" has the syllables [vুɔrliːg]. The commonality between the two words is the "oo" vowel sound, along with the "l" and "g" consonant sounds.</s>
joysticks, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
scharnieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "scharnieren" and "bestieren" do rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds followed by the same vowel sound. 

In both words, the consonant at the beginning is 's' followed by the same vowel 'e.' So, they have a similar consonant pattern. Additionally, both words end in the consonant 'r.' Although the first part of these words differs ('scharnieren' is about hinges and sliders, while 'bestieren' is about taming or domination), the vowel and consonant sounds in the end remain the same. So, it can be said that these two words have the same rhyme structure, which is considered a rhyme in Dutch.</s>
negotierend, purifierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "negotierend" and "purifierend" do rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

"Negotierend" has the pattern of "ng" - "ei"- "r".
"Purifierend" has the pattern of "vr" - "ei" - "r".

The vowels "ei" and "vr" and the consonants "ng" and "vr" produce identical sounds which results in rhyme.</s>
fanaaltjes, provinciaaltjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "fanaaltjes-provinciaaltjes" do rhyme, as they end with the same consonant-vowel-consonant sound sequence (la-ta).</s>
abstinentieverschijnsel, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "abstinentieverschijnsel-indeuk" do rhyme. 

Justification: In both words, the consonant sounds at the beginning of the word (b and d) and in the ending portion of the word (s) remain the same, which is a common pattern in many languages of the world, especially those with Germanic roots, where the ending consonant is pronounced and repeated. Moreover, the consonants in the middle of the words change, but the vowels stay the same (in the first word, 'st' and in the second word, 'ou'), and this combination of a repeated consonant sound and remaining vowels is often sufficient to qualify as a rhyming pair.</s>
planimetreer, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreer-navoelen" do rhyme. In this specific example, the vowels "o" in both words are identical, and the consonants that are followed by these vowels are also identical.</s>
kwartieren, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme.

The words "quartieren" and "pionieren" both end with the same consonant sound (/jaern/) and the same vowel sound (/ɪn/). This is an example of how Dutch words can rhyme, even when the final consonants are different. The identical vowel and consonant sounds create the rhyme in this case.</s>
wegdruip, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words don't rhyme. They have different consonants and no identical vowel and consonant sounds, as you can easily notice there is no '-ee' like sound in ‘registratierechten’ for instance. Thus, they don't share a rhyme scheme.</s>
voorlig, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig" and "ordenden" do rhyme because they share the same consonant pattern, with the "o" and "d" falling just before the same vowel sound "i" in both words. However, the consonant sounds and ending vowel in the words are slightly different, making the overall appearance of the wording slightly off, hence why this is considered a rhyming pair.</s>
zetterijen, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zetterijen" and "taswoning" do rhyme since they have a shared consonant pattern - [s] - followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds: [ɛ] and [ŋ].</s>
plantluis, welhebbende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words - "plantluis" and "welhebbende" - do rhyme. 

The reason is that the endings "-ant" and "-de" are consonant clusters that are identical in both words, and the letters "w" and "e" represent the same vowel sound in both words. Therefore, the underlying vowel sounds and consonants are the same in either word. This is called perfect rhyme in poetry. So, the two words do have different consonants, but the vowels in both words carry identical sounds and rhyme.</s>
ontroomt, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt" and "vuilpersleiding" do rhyme. They have different consonants ('t', 'v') followed by the same vowel sound (e in English) and the same consonant sound ('l' and 'r'). So, despite a difference in the first two letters, there's still a rhyme structure in the word arrangement.</s>
prejudicieren, supplieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "prejudicieren" and "supplieren" rhyme because their final two syllables - "rien" and "lieren" - have the same vowel and consonant sound, despite the differences in the initial consonants.</s>
recreeerden, specialiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words recreeerden-specialiseerden do rhyme since they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme is created by the -eren and -en endings in both words.</s>
reproducenten, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "reproducenten" and "statica," do rhyme because they both share the same consonant and vowel sounds at the end.

In both words, the last three characters - "enten" - are identical and consist of different consonants followed by the same vowel sound. Therefore, they rhyme in terms of their phonetic structure.</s>
zwijntjes, kwatrijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zwijntjes" and "kwatrijntjes" rhyme because the consonants and vowel sounds are the same, despite being different in spelling and pronunciation. The vowel "i" is the common element between the two words that creates the rhyme.</s>
trompetboom, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "trompetboom" and "ordenden," rhyme. 

trompetboom - tromp = boom
ordenden - ord = de = ten

The consonants in both words rhyme (tromp and de), and the final consonant 'm' in 'boom' follows the same pattern in both words (boom, de, ten).</s>
varieren, negotieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. To explain further:

'varieren' and 'negotieren' both have the word 'rien' at the end, which is silent and is not counting towards the rhyme. The key part of their rhyme comes from the consonant sounds preceding the vowel 'i' which is followed by the 'n' sound in both words. So, the rhyme is in the consonant sounds - 'v', '-rie', '-rie', 'e', 'e', 'n', and 'e'.</s>
piepjongst, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "piepjongst-schreeuweriger" rhyme. 

In English and many other languages, rhyming is often determined by the last syllable of the words. In both words, the last syllable "-erig" has the same consonant sound ending (pronounced like "y-err-eh-zhuh" in the first word and "y-uh-ruh" in the second), and the vowel sound is identical in both cases (pronounced like "i" in both words).</s>
Jut, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first two words "Jut-kwintalen" do rhyme. In this example, they share a "t" consonant sound immediately after the vowel, which creates a rhyme point. The syllables "jut-" and "-kwintalen" rhyme in this way.</s>
detacheer, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme: "detacheer" and "ingestort." They both end in the vowel sound "o" followed by the same consonant sound "t," which creates a unique vowel and consonant sequence in Dutch. Therefore, they rhyme because they share a similar structure and sound profile.</s>
resisterend, regulerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme. 

- resisterend and regulerend, have different consonants and identical vowel and consonant sounds. They share the same initial consonant sound (/z/), followed by the same vowel sound (/ɛ/) and identical final consonant sound (/nd/).</s>
prejudicieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given pairs of Dutch words rhyme.

In linguistics, rhyming is when two words share the same sequence of consonants and vowels at the end of their syllables. In these words, "prejudicieren" and "convenieren" end with the same sequence of consonant-vowel: -iern.

Prejudicieren means to prejudge or form an opinion hastily or without valid evidence. Convenieren means to be convenient or to suit one's needs.</s>
indoken, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds (ind, st) followed by the same vowel sound (o) at the end.</s>
attentie, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "attentie-ingestort" rhyme. Both words exhibit a similar pattern of consonant and vowel sounds, which is common in Dutch poetry and spoken language. This can also be found in words such as "hondentemperatuur" and "spelvorm."</s>
gleetjes, varieteetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gleetjes" and "varieteetjes" rhyme. They have different consonants in the beginning (g and v), but the identical vowel sound (ee) and the same consonant sound (t) in the end. This is a common pattern for rhyming words in Dutch, known as alliteration.</s>
prejudicierend, intervenierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
schapulieren, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schapulieren" and "pionieren" indeed rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant pattern. They have a similar consonant sound (sh for "schapulieren" and p for "pionieren"), and the identical vowel sound at the end is also the same.</s>
onderligger, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "onderligger" and "ontroomt" rhyme. They both have the same vowel sounds (/ɑn/) and only differ by one consonant (/r/ in the first word and /m/ in the second word). Even though they don't have identical consonant sounds, they share the same pattern, which is typical for rhyming words in Dutch.</s>
abc'tjes, tweetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because both "abc'tjes" and "tweetjes" share the same vowel and consonant sounds, although the letters in both words are not identical. The "d" and "ch" in "abc'tjes" and "twe-" in "tweetjes" sound similar and contribute to the rhyme between the words.</s>
rapieren, seculieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rapieren" and "seculieren" rhyme because they share the same pattern of consonant followed by the same vowel and consonant sound. In this case, "rapieren" contains the syllables "ra," "pe," "ri," "er," and "ne," and "seculieren" contains the syllables "se," "cu," "li," "en," and "ri," which follow the same pattern and create a rhyme.</s>
crediterend, proclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because the word "crediterend" has a different ending than "proclamerend." In Dutch, it is common for two words to have different endings, similar to English, and do not necessarily have the same consonant and vowel sounds combined. Rhymes play a crucial role in consonants and vowels combined, and in this case, the consonants "r" and "n" in "crediterend" and "proclamerend" are different. Therefore these words do not have the same rhyming pattern.</s>
embarkeerde, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "embarkeerde" and "getrasseerde" do rhyme. They both share the "aarde" ending, which causes the rhyme. The main difference between the words is the beginning consonants: "m" and "k" in "embarkeerde" versus "g" and "g" in "getrasseerde". The vowel sounds, consonant sounds, and spelling remain the same.</s>
retourtjes, voertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "retourtjes" and "voertjes" rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end (tj and s). The differences in the consonants (r vs. fr in "retourtjes" and r vs. n in "voertjes") are minor, and the repetition of the consonant "tj" and "s" makes the sound similar.</s>
sortietjes, bandietjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they both have the same consonant sounds (/s/ and /t/) followed by identical vowel sounds (/i/ and /y/) at the end. Rhyming is based on the similarity of end-sounds, as is the case here, hence they rhyme.</s>
geadministreerde, gebanderolleerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geadministreerde" and "gebanderolleerde" rhyme because they have identical sounds at the end. However, note that the word "geadministreerde" has a palatalized sound, making it slightly different from the others.</s>
essaaierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "essaaierend" and "solfegierend" rhyme because they both end with the same vowel and consonant sound – specifically, they both end with the consonant "nd" sound. The only difference between the two words is the presence of the "s" sound in the first word, which does not affect the rhyme.</s>
Batavieren, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
grietjes, bougietjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "grietjes" and "bougietjes" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by the same vowel sound and consonant (in this case 'tj' and 'gj') in the second word. This pattern is known as a "tj" rhyme.</s>
tensie, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie-ontroomt" do rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds despite having different consonants. The consonants in "tensie" and "ontroomt" are "t/n" and "r/r," respectively, and the vowel sounds are the same: "ei-" in both words. This is an example of a rhyme scheme in Dutch poetry, which often features rhymes on a regular basis.</s>
nieren, mortieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "nieren" and "mortieren" rhyme, as they have a similar vowel sound and final consonant. The only difference between the words is the consonant sound "t" in "mortieren" which is a voiceless "t", while in "nieren" it is a voiced "t". Despite this difference, the end consonant and vowel sound (pronounced as in "in-yer-en" and "mohr-tear-en") are identical in both words, thus they do rhyme.</s>
duif, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonants ('u' and 'er') followed by identical vowel and consonant sound ('iu' in both words). Rhyming words in Dutch can be either end rhymes (as in 'duif-schreeuwerigere') or internal rhymes ('u' and 'er' in the words).</s>
nadook, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
geadministreerde, decimeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geadministreerde" and "decimeerde" do rhyme. They share the identical ending consonant sound, which makes the rhyme scheme a "cV" rhyme. The difference in the beginning of the words, "ge" vs. "deci," does not affect the rhyme, as the "me" in both words has the identical pronunciation.</s>
zondagssluiting, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

Justification: In both these Dutch words, 'Z', 'S', and 'L' are consonants, and they have identical vowels 'U' and 'O' which are followed by the same consonant 'E'. This combination of consonants and identical vowel and consonant sounds indeed make for a rhyme.</s>
Jut, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "jut-invallen" rhyme because they share the identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference is the addition of the consonant 'j' (in "ju") at the start, which doesn't change the overall rhyme.</s>
ontduik, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They both have the same initial consonant sound "ont-" and identical final vowel and consonant sounds "ingestelde." This makes them rhyme words in the Dutch language.</s>
hartzwakte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "hartzwakte-nadook" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the -nadook ending has the same consonants and vowel sound as the -zwakte ending. Additionally, both words end with the same consonant sound (dook-zwakte).</s>
wegdruip, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || The Dutch words, wegdruip and voorlig, do rhyme, as they have different consonants, [w]et-[v]oerlit, followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, (/ɛt/ in "wegdruip" and /vɔr/lɪt in "voorlig"). Therefore, the answer is Yes.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loopgravenstellingen" and "invul" rhyme, as they both have different consonants (c, q, g, and f) followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds. In the word "loopgravenstellingen" (loop grave lines), the vowel sound occurs after the consonant 'q,' while in the word "invul" (fill or load), the vowel sound occurs after the consonant 'f.' Although they are not exact rhymes, considering the position of the consonant and vowel sounds, they still carry a similar consonant and vowel structure.</s>
certifierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Specifically, the rhyme occurs at the last two syllables: "ert-" and "ert-".</s>

treknet, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'treknet-overlig' do have a rhyme. They share identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end of each word, creating a rhyming pattern. While the words are not palindromic (with the same meaning when read forward and backward), the ending consonant and vowel combination creates the illusion of similarity in pronunciation.</s>
chocolaatjes, h'tjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "chocolaatjes" and "h'tjes" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds (ch-ch-ch-t-t) followed by identical vowel sounds (o-o-o-as-s).</s>
rentenieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rentenieren" and "brevieren" do rhyme.

bijstanders, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
introduceetjes, reetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "introduettejes" and "reetjes" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. These words rhyme, because "ette" and "etjes" have the same ending syllable (both start with a long "e" sound) while the initial consonants in both words are different. Although they are both from Dutch, the words "introduettejes" and "reetjes" might not sound exactly the same in casual speech because of the difference in the consonant sounds at the beginning of each word. Nonetheless, they still fit the criteria for being considered as rhyming words.</s>
jaartjes, laartjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words jaartjes and laartjes do rhyme. They both have different consonants - j and l, and the same consonant sound at the end, which happens to be in the mid-vowel position, as indicated by the i in "tjips" (a colloquial expression in Dutch, meaning "whining" or "complaining"). This characteristic is often found in Dutch compound words, making them rhyme.</s>
essaaierend, discussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "essaaierend" and "discussierend" have the same consonant sounds and rhyme. Both words end with the same consonant: -r- in "essaaierend" and -r- in "discussierend." The only difference between the two words is the vowel sound before the final consonant, but the rhyme still holds due to the ending consonant being the same.</s>
denoncerend, proclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'denoncerend' and 'proclamerend' do rhyme. They have the same vowel sound sequence (i.e., "oncer-end"), but the consonant sounds are different, changing the word from ending in "nce" to ending in "clm".</s>
psalmodierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'psalmodierend' and 'bediscussierend' do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds, but with different consonants. In this case, the consonant "s" changes from the first word to "z" in the second word, but both end with the same vowel and consonant combination of "ing".</s>
janplezieren, portieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as the combination of some different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds creates a rhyme.</s>
janplezieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. Both words have the same vowel and consonant sound at the end of each word, making them rhyme.

rentenieren, dieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rentenieren" and "dieren" do rhyme. They both end with the consonant sound "n" combined with the vowel sound "ien" (pronounced "yen").

To further explain: "dieren" means "animals" or "sons" (in the sense of biological sons) in Dutch. "Rentenieren" means "to replenish, to renew" or "renting." The word "dieren" contains the consonant sound "di" which rhymes with the final sound of "rentenieren".</s>
asfyxieren, glorieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Dutch words can rhyme if the consonants that come before, and after, a vowel sound are the same; in this case, the words "asfyxieren" and "glorieren" have consonants sounding the same before and after vowels, resulting in a rhyme.</s>
discussieren, unieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words both rhyme because they have identical vowel sounds at the end (e and ier) and differ by a single consonant (i in dis, u in uni), followed by the same consonant sound.</s>
quintolen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "quintolen" and "esthetiek," both possess an 'i' vowel, but the vowel sounds are different. In "quintolen," the vowel 'i' is a schwa vowel (/ɪ/), whereas in "esthetiek," the vowel 'i' is an ij vowel (/ij/). Therefore, they do rhyme in terms of having the same consonant sounds following their vowels (i.e., 'q' and 'sh' in both cases), but with different vowel sounds.</s>
kolendampvergiftiging, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kolendampvergiftiging" and "statica" rhyme in Dutch. They both have the same vowel and consonant sounds:

- "kolendampvergiftiging" has the stress on the first syllable (COL-endampVERG-rifti-gi-ning)
- "statica" has the stress on the second syllable (staTIka)

Both syllables consist of identical vowel and consonant sounds (ENDampVERG-rifti-gi and staTIka) that follow different consonants.</s>
kohieren, dieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as they each have the same vowel sequence (ee) and consonants at the end (ieren and ieren).</s>
jut, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "jut-naduiken," rhyme because they have different consonants (j and t) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/ju:nəkykən/).</s>
spieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spieren" and "saffieren" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, "spieren" means "muscles" and "saffieren" means "to bite hard" or "to bite like a viper". 

The rhyming pattern in both words is "ai" followed by "er," which is a common pattern in Dutch. For example, "bijen" and "mijne" also have the same rhyming pattern, making "spieren" and "saffieren" part of this family of words.</s>
jut, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jut-uitrokend" rhyme. The words share identical vowel and consonant sounds, with "uit" as the only non-identical part.</s>

brandverzekering, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme because they both have the consonant sounds "br-" and "vl-," followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
discussieren, humilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "discussiën" and "humiliëren" both rhyme because they have identical vowel sounds (e and ië) and different consonant sounds at the end (n in "discussiën" and r in "humiliëren").</s>
ontroomt, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt" and "verluchtten" rhyme.

The justification for this answer lies in the phonological rules of Dutch, which emphasizes final -t (i.e., the Dutch stress is on the last syllable). Therefore, by Dutch standards, "-nt" sound is similar if both the letters are adjacent to the final syllable in those words (although "ontroomt" carries the stress on the 'n' syllable and "verluchtten" carries it on the 't' syllable), resulting in a rhyming effect. 

The other letters are identical as well, which supports the idea of a rhyme in Dutch.</s>
kopieren, prejudicieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kielvlak, framepjes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "framepjes" do rhyme, as they have different consonants (C) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (V). Additionally, they both end with the same consonant sound, making them a case of consonantal rhyme.</s>

kreupelbossen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "kreupelbossen-nadook" rhyme because they have similar consonant and vowel sounds in both words, thus creating a rhyme.</s>
pruimenboomgaarden, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pruimenboomgaarden" and "aanvijl" do rhyme. 

In Dutch, rhyme is based on the similarity of acoustic attributes, such as vowels sounds and consonant sounds. The two words you provide are an example of this, sharing a common ending sound (-vaijl in "aanvijl"), which makes them rhymes.</s>
voorlig, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig" and "ontduik" have different consonants but the identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end. In this case, "e" in "voorlig" and "o" in "ontduik" are identical. They rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds, despite having different consonants ahead of the same vowel.</s>
abc'tjes, resumeetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "abc'tjes-resumeetjes" do rhyme because they have the same consonant-vowel pattern. 

In this case, both words consist of identical consonant sounds, 't' and 's', followed by the identical vowel sound 'a', and finally both words end with the identical final consonant 'e'. This phonetic combination is a prime example of a rhyming sound in Dutch.</s>
irreguliere, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words 'irreguliere' and 'begieren' do rhyme, as they have a common vowel sound followed by the same consonant at the end. The rhyme is a combination of a different consonant (i.e., 'e' in 'irreguliere' and 'r' in 'begieren') and the same vowel sound (i.e., 'o' in both words). The rhyme creates a harmonious pattern in Dutch poetry and wordplay.</s>
convenierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "convenierend-solfegierend" are considered a perfect rhyme, or a rhyme scheme called "V-V" or "v-v" in the Dutch language, where the two words end with the same vowel sound.</s>
verluchtten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verluchtten" and "ontduik" do rhyme. They have the same vowel sound (t) and the same consonant sound (k) at the end.</s>
beneficieren, notifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

In "beneficieren" and "notifieren," the only similarity is the "-ien" vowel group at the end, which appears in both words. However, the initial consonant sounds (beneficieren starts with "benefi-" and notifieren starts with "notif-") do not match.</s>
geevoqueerde, glaceerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

The words "geevoqueerde" and "glaceerden" do not have the same or rhyme sounds. The words are spelled in a way which makes it appear that they rhyme, but in the Dutch language, spelling and pronunciation may or may not reflect the meaning of words. 

"geevoqueerde" can be pronounced as "ge'o okuurde," which also doesn't have any similar pronunciation to "glaceerden" which is pronounced as "glaci'e red". Rhyming pairs in Dutch usually have the same number of vowels and consonants. The words "leefde" and "pareldreef" or "kraai" and "klaar" are examples of such words that rhyme. I apologize for the confusion, but these two words do not create a rhyme in the traditional sense.</s>
quintolen, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

In the given words "quintolen" and "detacheer," the identical consonant sounds come at the end of each word. In both cases, the consonants are Q (quintolen starts with "quinte") and T (detacheer starts with "de-"). The vowel sounds are both I when combined with the final consonant, which forms the rhyme.

In summary, the rhyme in these Dutch words occurs because the identical vowel and consonant sounds (the final consonant sounds: I in Quintolen and T in Detacheer) remain consistent through their structure.</s>
dissimilaties, illuminaties, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They have different consonant sounds at the beginning (dissimilaties vs. illuminaties) but the same final consonant and vowel sounds (t vs t). Therefore, they do not have the same rhyme scheme.</s>
fauteuiltjes, jan-boerenfluitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In both words, the "j" and "t" consonant sounds are different, while the vowel sounds and the "f" sound are the same. In English, "flute" and "faulteuiltje" and "flit" and "jan" have a similar pattern of vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme.</s>
toereikend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toereikend" and "esthetiek" rhyme. This is because both words have a similar pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds, with the only difference being the shift in the second syllable from "ik" in "toereikend" to "iek" in "esthetiek".</s>
detacheer, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "uitrokend" do rhyme. They both end with the same vowel sound ("ou") and differ only by a single consonant, "t" and "d" respectively. The rhyme is created by the consonantal structure and the position of the final consonant.</s>
glanduleuze, volumineuze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "glanduleuze" and "volumineuze" do rhyme, as they both have the same vowel sound (eu) at the end, despite the different consonant sounds before the vowel (g and v). However, it's important to note that in Dutch, rhyme is slightly more nuanced than in some other languages, so the way these words rhyme (stressed or unstressed syllables, assonance, or consonance) may be considered different in different dialects or by different language learners.</s>
sanctifierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "sanctifierend" and "bediscussierend," share the same consonant and vowel sounds. They both end with the same vowel sound (/i.t/) and the consonant sound (/n/). However, the consonant sound changes between the two words. "Sanctifierend" has "s" and "f" at the end, while "bediscussierend" has "b" and "d" at the end, but both end in the same consonant and vowel sound combination.</s>
gecollecteerde, embarkeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two Dutch words, "gecollecteerde" and "embarkeerde," do rhyme because they have the same consonant sound followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds, making the word endings "de" and "de" rhyme.</s>
satansboleten, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "satansboleten-esthetica" do rhyme, as they share a similar consonant-vowel-consonant pattern (s-a-t, s-e-t, s-h-e-t, s-t-h-e, s-t-h-e-t-i-c). Rhyming is still based on the similarity of the sounds, and vowels, however different their shapes, can be pronounced similarly.</s>
welbedachte, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "welbedachte" and "indeuk" rhyme as they have similar consonant sounds. In both words, the "t" and "k" sounds are similar, while the "e" and "u" are identical. Additionally, their final consonants, "d" and "k," are close in sound.</s>
plantluis, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "ritmeren" do rhyme. They are homophonous (have the same pronunciation), but with a different consonant in each word. The vowels and consonant sounds are identical, which makes their rhyme pattern count as a true rhyme.</s>
versmallen, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the word. The only difference is in the consonant sounds that come before the vowel "e" and "o" in each word (versmallen vs zondagssluiting).</s>
Jut, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'jut' and 'regimentscommandant' rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The consonant clusters 'jut-' and 'reg-' both have the same vowel ('u'), followed by 't' and 'm' respectively. The 'commandant' part uses the same consonant sounds throughout, which further reinforces the rhyme.</s>
gratifierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "gratifierend" and "bediscussierend," have the same consonant and vowel patterns, but they are pronounced differently. In English, the first word rhymes with "shrinking," and the second word rhymes with "bedside." The presence of the same vowel and consonant patterns in both words indicates that they rhyme.</s>
onderligger, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "onderligger" and "ontruimt" rhyme because they have the same initial and ending consonant sounds following identical vowel sounds.</s>
dieren, nieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme (dieren-nieren). Both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds: 

- dieren (animals) and nieren (kidneys) share the identical vowel sound "i" that follows the consonant "n."</s>
annexeren, resisteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "annexeren" and "resisteren," do rhyme, meaning they have the identical vowel and consonant sounds in the final syllables. In this case, both words have the same vowel sound (/ɑn/ for "annexeren" and /ɑn/ for "resisteren") and identical consonant sounds before that /ɑn/. So, they are true rhymes.</s>
essayeren, marchanderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have the same consonant and vowel sounds as they have different letters in between (the "y" in "essayeren" and the "nd" in "marchanderen"). Rhyming words in Dutch typically follow a pattern of having the same consonant and vowel sound without any changes in the letters that come before or after the vowel sound.</s>
tensie, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "tensie-negerwijk," do rhyme. The key points to notice are the final vowel sounds ("ee" in "tensie" and "wijk"), and the palatalized consonant in the middle ("t in tensie"), which is a common feature in many Dutch words.</s>
zenuwpijn, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" (nerve pain) and "navel" do rhyme, as they both have the same final consonant sound (vowel + n + consonant). Although "navel" starts with a /ɲ/ sound (pronounced like "ny" in English), this sound is the same as the /n/ in "zenuwpijn." The main rhyme comes from the final -l consonant.</s>
schaverdijntjes, harlekijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "schaverdijntjes" and "harlekijntjes" rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant pattern at the end of the words. Specifically, both words have "ijnt" (a short sequence of vowels and consonants) at the end, which rhymes in this context.</s>
convenierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme (also known as homophones) because they share the same spelling with only slight differences in the consonant sounds at the end of each word. Despite the small variation in the consonant sounds ('-ier' and '-iér'), the vowels remain the same, and therefore the words have the same pronunciation and rhyme.</s>
kielvlakken, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words kielvlakken and zenuwpijn do have identical consonant and vowel sounds. They are akin in consonant sounds but different in vowel sounds. This makes them a pair of rhyming words.</s>
passagieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. "Passagieren" and "begieren" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme. In this case, they both end with the combination "e" followed by the sound "j" in the second word.</s>
kielvlak, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'kielvlak' and 'blauwbekkend' do rhyme. To break it down, the sounds at the ends of both words are 'a' followed by the same consonant 'l' and 'k' respectively. The other vowels in the words 'kiel' and 'blauw' also have their corresponding spelling. The words, therefore, have the same consonant sounds in their endings, making them rhyme.</s>
tuinierend, verzwierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tuinierend" and "verzwierend" rhyme, as they share the same vowel sound (/i/ or /e/) that is followed by similar consonant sounds (/tj/, /j/, /z/, and /n/).</s>
colloiden, gebieden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds – in this case, "-ij-" is an example of a rhyme. The first word, "colloiden-gebieden", literally means "colloid regions" in Dutch, while the second word, "gel-gebieden," translates to "gel regions." Despite the differences in the consonants (colloiden-gebieden uses "l" and "g" while gel-gebieden uses "d" and "bd"), the ending "-ij-" in both words is the same and contributes to the rhyme.</s>
nadook, kolendampvergiftiging, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "nadook" and "kolendampvergiftiging" do rhyme because they both have the same vowel sound (o) followed by the same consonant sounds (p, b, l, m, g, s, t, d, v).</s>
jut, kelderdeur, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-kelderdeur" do rhyme. This is because they share the same vowel and consonant sound at the end of the words.

In this case, the words share the same final syllable "uur" (which has the same vowel sound and consonant sound), which is why they rhyme.</s>
ontsieren, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'ontsieren' and 'pluvieren' are considered to rhyme based on the principle of rhyming, even though they are spelled and pronounced differently. In each word, the final vowel and the consonant (t/s) make the same sounds.</s>
voorlegt, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. However, the word with a small typo, "taswoning" (which should be "taswooning" to rhyme), remains a valid match.</s>
heertjes, schorseneertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "heertjes" and "schorseneertjes" do rhyme because they have the same vowel (e) and the same consonant (r) pattern, although the beginning consonants are different (h and s). In Dutch, word rhymes are usually determined by the consonants before the identical vowel and consonant sequence at the end of the words.</s>
piepjongst, jatte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "jatte" do rhyme, as they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Piepjongst" consists of the sounds /pj/, /i/, /ɑn/, /d/, /t/, while "jatte" has the sounds /j/, /a/, /tt/, /e/.</s>
larderend, objectiverend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "larderend" and "objectiverend" rhyme because they both end with the consonant sound "r" followed by the same vowel sound "o" and "e". This creates the vowel-consonant pattern that is common in rhyming sounds in Dutch.</s>
presumerend, pasporterend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words in the Dutch phrase "presumerend-pasporterend" do have the same consonant sounds. 

In the first word "presumerend" (pre-sume-ring), the only difference between the consonant sounds between the two words is the final 'n' sound. 

Following the same pattern, the second word "pasporterend" (pass-po-tering) has the same consonant sounds, only changing the order as well as the 'n' sound in the middle of the word.</s>
gebanderolleerde, decimeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words gebanderolleerde (having the stress on the first syllable: "ge-ban-der-ol-leerde") and decimeerde (having the stress on the first syllable: "de-ci-meerde") do rhyme as they both have identical rhyme sounds, followed by different consonant sounds. The consonant sounds in both words are /n/ (/ən, ən/) and /d/ (/t/). The vowel sounds, /ə/ (/e/), are the same in both words. It is important to note that the stress lies on the first syllable, which is 'ge-' for gebanderolleerde and 'de-' for decimeerde.</s>
ontsieren, portieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontsieren" and "portieren" do rhyme because they share a similar pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds:

- "ontsieren" (to erase) has the vowel sounds 'o-t-s-i-r-e-n', while "portieren" (to carry) also has the same vowel sounds 'o-t-s-i-r-e-n'.

Both words end with the same consonant sound 'n'. Therefore, they rhyme due to having the same vowel and consonant pattern.</s>
schapulieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schapulieren" and "bestieren" have identical consonant and vowel sounds as "r" and "y" make the same phonetic impact on both words. In both words, the vowel "y" at the end of "schapulieren" and "bestieren" is pronounced more as an "i" sound, thus they could be considered part of the same phoneme, which gives them a kind of rhyme. The two words have the same spelling and pronunciation with just one letter difference – "s" and "b" change into "r" and "st" – but they sound very similar and functionally can be seen as rhyming words.</s>
mythologiseerde, convoceerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "mythologiseerde" and "convoceerden" are examples of Dutch syllabic rhymes. In the given pair, "mythologiseerde" contains the syllable "mytholog-" and "convoceerden" contains the syllable "convoceer-". The -log- syllable rhymes with each other, even though there are different vowels before and after it. Though not perfect rhymes, these syllables share the same consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
slieren, pieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "slieren" and "pieren" rhyme because they have different consonant sounds followed by the identical vowel and consonant sound of "iér". In English, we call this a simple consonant rhyme.</s>
salarierend, europeaniserend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "salarierend" and "europeaniserend" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words end with the same vowel sound ( /a/ in /arierend/) and the same consonant sound ( /e/ in /salary/ and /u/ in /eu-ropean/).</s>
jaartjes, pilaartjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

jaartjes (years) and pilaartjes (little pillars) are not rhyming, they have different consonants and final consonant clusters (tje/je and liaartje/lliaartje, respectively). In speech, these words might sound similar due to the identical vowel sounds but they are not rhyming in the same way as words with the same consonant and vowel combination would be.</s>
piepjongst, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "interimaat" contain a pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds with differences in only the final consonant sounds, causing the words to rhyme in this case.</s>
reconcilierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "reconcilierend" and "distantierend" rhyme. They share identical vowels and consonant sounds at the end. The consonant differences ('r' in "reconcilierend" and 'n' in "distantierend") do not affect the rhyme, as they occur before the same vowels in both words and still create the identical sounds.</s>
attentie, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
multiplierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "multiplierend" and "asfyxierend" rhyme, as they have identically spelled and pronounced vowels and consonants. In this case, the "e" in "multiplierend" and "asfyxierend" are identical and produce a long close-mid vowel sound. This meeting of vowels and consonants contributes to the rhyming of the words.</s>
jut, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-navoelen" do rhyme as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Jut" and "navoelen" are just pronounced differently but share the same syllables.</s>
composteerden, collaboreerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "composteerden" and "collaboreerden" rhyme, as they both consist of identical vowel and consonant sounds. In the words "composteerden" (com-po-stay-er-den) and "collaboreerden" (kol-uh-bore-er-den), the only difference between them is the "t" sound in the first word and the "l" sound in the second word. This change in consonant sound does not affect the rhyme, as the vowels and consonant patterns remain the same. Therefore, we can classify this as a vowel harmony rhyme.</s>
welbedachte, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they share the identical vowel and consonant sounds which makes them rhyme. 

The phrase "welbedachte" means "thoroughly thought-out" in English. The prefix "wel-" (well) is followed by the word "bedachte" (thought-out). Both words have different consonants followed by the same vowel 'e', which is the third vowel sound in each word. As we know, the sequence of consonants followed by the same vowel in the words makes them rhyme.</s>
jut, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-invallen" rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme according to the Dutch pronunciation rules.</s>
wegdropen, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "wegdropen" and "zondagssluiting" do rhyme or have the same consonant and vowel sounds at the end. In this case, "weg" and "sluiting" are the rhyming words, as "w" and "s" have the same consonant, followed by the same vowel "e" and "i", respectively. The words have the same consonant and vowel sound at the end, making them rhyme in the Dutch language.</s>
kielvlak, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'kielvlak' and 'toerekent' do rhyme because they have a common rime structure, specifically, they end with the same consonant followed by two identical vowel sounds. In these words, 'la' and 'een' create the identical consonant sounds and the same vowel sounds, resulting in a rhyming pattern.</s>
dispenseerden, assisteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The words "dispenseerden" and "assisteerde" have different consonant sounds at the beginning and the end of the words. Only the vowel sounds are the same, which is an example of homophony in Dutch but not true rhyming.</s>
tensie, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "uitreikend" do rhyme as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
zondagssluiting, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they share the identical vowel and consonant sound at the end of the words, following different consonants. The rhyme is achieved due to the similarity in the final consonant sound, which is /t/.</s>
meridionaal, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "invul" do rhyme. They both share the same pattern of identical final consonant ("-L") and the initial sequence of consonants is the same in both words ("MER-"). Justification for this rhyme is evident from the observation that the vowel sounds, as in "i" in "meridionaal" and "u" in "invul", remain the same, even though the specific pronunciation (vowels and consonants) of each word are different. This makes "meridionaal" and "invul" rhyming words, as they share the same vowel sounds, and therefore the same rhyme pattern.</s>
welbedachte, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "welbedachte" and "planimetreer" do rhyme. They both have a similar structure, where the second word "planimetreer" starts with a new vowel sound ("l"), but the other letters match in both words. The consonant sounds also match, with the consonant "e" in "welbedachte" changing to "eer" in "planimetreer."</s>
piepjongst, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words indeed rhyme. The word formation and spelling of "piepjongst-ordende" resembles that of a Dutch word for "sticking-together" (which would typically be pronounced as "peep-joengst-ordende" or "peep-yoengst-ordende"). Both phrases end with identical vowels and consonant sounds (oe and n).</s>
veranderingsmogelijkheden, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
narcotiseren, concilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because they have different consonant sounds at the beginning (e.g. "n" vs. "k"), and the same vowel and consonant sound at the end ("ar" in both words). However, the word order is reversed.</s>
missioneerde, assisteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words missioneerde-assisteerde do rhyme.

In this case, both words in the pair share a common pattern of consonant sounds followed by a similar vowel sound. In "missioneerde", the consonant is "s", and in "assisteerde", the consonant is also "s". The identical vowel sound between the two words is the "e". This is why they rhyme.</s>
joysticks, beschietend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. Let's dissect them:

- "joysticks": 
The vowels are "oo" (the stress is on the first syllable), which might sound similar when said quickly, and the consonants are "j" and then "s", but they are two distinct sounds. This doesn't rhyme with anything.

- "beschietend":
The vowels are "e" and the "sh" in "schiet" is replaced with a hard "s" sound. In isolation, these vowels and sounds don't match the "oo" sound in the first word. Therefore, these words do not rhyme. 

In summary, the words "joysticks" and "beschietend" do not have the same consonant and vowel sounds, and thus do not rhyme in Dutch.</s>
refreintjes, strapontijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

The words "refreintjes" and "strapontijntjes" are pronounced as "REHF-ryant-jez" and "STRAP-on-jez." The first word ends with the vowel sound /eɪz/, and the second word ends with the vowel sound /ɪz/. The consonants /r/, /s/, and /t/ in the first word don't match /p/ and /s/ sounds in the second word. This indicates that the two words do not rhyme.</s>
associeren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || To determine if these Dutch words rhyme, we need to compare their consonants and vowels sounds.

Step 1: Identify the consonant sounds in "associeren" (associate).

- Initial consonant: "s"
- Final consonant: "r"

Step 2: Identify the consonant sounds in "convenieren" (convince, but in Dutch, one would use "convenieren" meaning "to persuade").

- Initial consonant: "k"
- Final consonant: "r" or "n"

As can be seen, Dutch words have different final consonant sounds ("r" and "n"), making them different and not rhyming words. However, they do share an identical final "r" consonant sound, so they could be considered as having a 'consonant echo', but this depends on linguistic context.</s>
repliceren, declareren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "repliceren" and "declareren" rhyme in the Dutch language. They share the same consonant and vowel sound pattern, making them rhyming words.</s>
voorlegt, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlegt" and "ordenden" rhyme because they share the same vowel sound (a in "ordre" and "aangelegd") and both end with the consonant "n." They differ in the following consonants (l and t for "ordenden" and n for "voorlegt").</s>
slieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
taswoning, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "taswoning-aanvijl" do not rhyme because they do not share the same vowel or consonant sounds at the end of their syllables. In the first word, the consonant "g" is repeated at the end, and the word "aanvijl" shares identical vowels and consonants. However, "taswoning" ends with "n", a different consonant, which is not followed by the same vowel as in the second word. Therefore, the sounds at the end of the words do not match, and the words do not rhyme.</s>
plevieren, tempelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plevieren" and "tempelieren" do have the same consonant sounds in the end of the words and the same vowel sound. However, their meanings are different (to shake or rattle and the act of striking someone in the temple). The rhyme, which is distinctive for Dutch language, is due to the similarity of these sounds, which is possible due to the Dutch language's complex phonetics.</s>
weetjes, instantaneetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'weetjes' and 'instantaneetjes' do rhyme, as you pointed out. 

Let me explain why. In Dutch, a language that follows a phonetic approach in rhyming, rhyme forms when there are repeated consonant sounds immediately after one another. In this case, the sound 't' in both words, and the 's' in 'instantaneetjes' follow the same consonant pattern.

The vowel sound in the beginning of 'weetjes' and 'instantaneetjes' has a similar sound but does not actually rhyme since Dutch follows the phonetic approach and not just the IPA phonetic representation (International Phonetic Alphabet used in dictionaries). Therefore, they sound similar but are not technically considered as rhyming.</s>
deeltijdbanen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deeltijdbanen" and "invul" rhyme. They have the same pattern of identical vowel sounds (i in both), followed by consonant sounds (d in the first word and n in the second word).</s>
puitjes, jan-boerenfluitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds (p, j, b, f). The first word consists of the syllables puit (like 'poot'), j (voiced "j" like in "jute"), and sje (like 'si' in 'kiss', the Dutch form of 'sch'). The second word has three syllables: jan (meaning 'John', which is pronounced with a voiced "j" like in 'john'), boer (like 'boy', as in 'dairy boy') and fluit (like 'flaw', as in 'flute'). The third word contains two syllables: boeren (meaning 'farmers') and fluitjes (similar to the English 'little flutes', like tiny clarinets).</s>
stipendierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. Both words end with the sound /ə/ (as in bed) and differ only in consonants within the vowel, specifically /z/ and /s/ respectively.</s>
voorlegt, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlegt-brandverzekering" rhyme because both words have the same vowel (e) followed by -gert- (a consonant cluster) and -verz- (a common Dutch suffix) in the second word. The difference in the other consonants does not affect the rhyme.</s>
psychoanalytici, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme.

'Psychoanalytici' and 'bedrijving' both have different consonants followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds sequence 'ci' which makes them rhyme. Dutch has a unique pronunciation system where many words follow this pattern, making it possible to rhyme words even though they have completely different structures.</s>
schapulieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "schapulieren" and "staffieren," do rhyme, as they have similar consonant and vowel sounds at the end:

- "schapulieren" has the consonant sound "l" and the vowel sound "ie", which is present in both words.
- "staffieren" has the consonant sound "f" and the same vowel sound "ie".

Although the words are homophones, they do have similar rhyming patterns due to the presence of the consonant and vowel sounds at the end of each word.</s>
kreupelbossen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme.

kreupelbossen-aanvijl </s>
crisisteam, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "crisisteam-zenuwpijn" do rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sound at the end (in this case, "ay" sound in "team" and "pijn").</s>
piepjongst, antwoordend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst-antwoordend" rhyme because both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds as well as different consonants. The words have the same pattern of consonants followed by the same consonant sound "ngst" and "wrd", making them rhyme in the language of Dutch.</s>
spieren, slieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "spieren" and "slieren" do rhyme because both words have identical sounds for the final consonant letter "r" and the word ending "-ien".</s>
voteren, desorganiseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voteren" and "desorganiseren" do rhyme. They have different consonants - "t" and "z" - and an identical consonant at the end: "r". The vowels are the same as well. Although the words use different consonants, the pronunciation of their consonant and vowel sounds match, making them rhyme.</s>
resisteren, flocculeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of these Dutch words end with identical vowel and consonant sounds, as shown by their final syllable /-ər/ and /-ər/. The consonants just come earlier in each word.</s>
geitereerde, gerecipieerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geitereerde" and "gerecipieerde" rhyme because they share the same vowel sound and consonant after the first consonant. The difference in the first consonant makes them phonetically close to each other.</s>
percipieren, distantieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words do rhyme as they have similar vowel and consonant sounds. Please note that the specific rhyme pattern may not be universally clear for all speakers, but the pattern can be identified by experienced Dutch language speakers or through the help of a Dutch dictionary. 

Here's a breakdown:

1. "Percipieren" - Per - cie - ren, where 'cie' shares a similar vowel sound.
2. "Distantieren" - Dis - tan - tien, where 'tien' is another Dutch word also with a similar vowel pattern.

In such cases, Dutch poetry, music and song lyrics can utilize the rhyme to connect words, or in literature, the rhyme would add a sense of flow, making it easier for the reader to remember the words and their meaning.</s>
kielvlak, gelukzoekster, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" (flat bottom) and "gelukzoekster" (someone seeking happiness) do rhyme. They have the same vowel sound "o" (as in "to") followed by the same consonant sound "l" (as in "dog"). So rhyming word structures in Dutch are common for words with these similar ending sounds.</s>
expedieren, negotieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words exhibit consonant and vowel rhyme. Both "expedieren" and "negotieren" consist of identical consonant sounds followed by the same vowel sound "e."</s>
rentenieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rittenieren-brevieren" do indeed rhyme, as they have identical vowel sounds in the end. 

Both words end in -eren, which is the typical ending for verbs in Dutch. The main difference between them is in the consonant sound that precedes the final vowel, which is a 'r' in the first word and a 'v' in the second word. Despite this small difference in consonant sounds, the rhyme remains intact because the final consonant of each word is the same - /nj/ in 'ritten' and /v/- /j/ in 'brevier'. The letters 'r' and 'v' are similar in sound in Dutch.</s>
kohieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "kohieren" and "begieren" do not rhyme. They actually sound quite dissimilar. Let me break it down for you:

- "kohieren" consists of the consonant clusters "kh-r-n", with "kh" and "r" being the core sounds.
- "begieren" consists of the consonant clusters "b-g-j-r", with "b", "g", "j", and "r" being the core sounds. The "j" is particularly unique, sounding much closer to an "h" in English.

It's not clear if these two Dutch words are intended to rhyme with each other, but if we consider their sounds, they do not rhyme in the traditional sense.</s>
wegdruip, deeltijdbanen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

In this example, "wegdruip" and "deeltijdbanen" both have identical consonants at the end, with the added sound of "ei" for "deeltijdbanen" as a diphthong, which is a common feature in Dutch words. This results in the words having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
karekieten, entomolieten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "karekieten" and "entomolieten" do rhyme. This is because the words have similar endings composed of different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The word "karekieten" ends with "iet," and "entomolieten" ends with "ieten." The "iet" sound is identical in both words, producing a rhyming effect.</s>
indoken, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "indoken-esthetiek" rhyme. 

In this case, both words have similar consonants and vowel sounds (ind-knee-sthet-eeek). The only difference is the word that starts with "i" versus "a" in "indoken," but this difference does not affect their rhyme or pronunciation.</s>
jut, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have the same vowel sound, "-ig-" and the consonant sounds before the identical vowel, "-uts," have different consonants but the same sequence of consonants. Therefore, they rhyme.</s>
koelkamer, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "koelkamer" and "nadook" do rhyme because the final syllables are identical, even though they are derived from different consonants.

"Koelkamer" contains the consonant "k," while "nadook" has the consonant "n". Despite the difference in those sounds, the identical vowel sound combined with the consonant at the end of the word results in what is known as a "syllabic" rhyme.

This similarity of the final syllables allows the words to be considered as rhyming words in Dutch, contributing to their blending and matching of sounds, which is essential in the process of rhyme in the Dutch language.</s>
salarierend, remarquerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "salarierend" and "remarquerend" rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds at the beginning and end, followed by identical vowels.</s>
koelkamer, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: The Dutch words provided, 'koelkamer' (meaning 'cool room' or 'cooler') and 'voorlegt' (meaning 'preamble' or 'prologue' with a more poetic or literary connotation), may or may not rhyme depending on the pronunciation. Despite having different consonants at the beginning, both share an identical sequence of vowel and consonant sounds. In particular, the first syllable, /kɔlkâmɛr/ and /vɔorlegt/, are the same (ignoring the Dutch pronunciation rules). Hence, these words rhyme in terms of pattern and the common consonant sounds between them.</s>
prejudicieren, ambieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "prejudicieren" and "ambieren" do rhyme. They have the same rhyme scheme (consonant-vowel-consonant).</s>
dieren, tierelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No.

These Dutch words, "dieren" and "tierelieren," do not rhyme because the spelling and pronunciation of the words are different. "Dieren" (meaning "animals") has the consonant pattern "d-d-r-r-n," while "tierelieren" (meaning "to imitate small animals") has the consonant pattern "t-t-r-l-r-l-r." The only similarity lies in the presence of the vowel 'e' at the end of each word, but the consonant sounds preceding the 'e' are distinct. The words are not related in terms of pronunciation, thus they cannot be considered as rhyming words.</s>
gerendeerden, gerescribeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. While both words contain similar vowel sounds (e.g. i in gerendeerden and i in gerescribeerde), and there are some common consonant sounds (c in both words), the different consonants at the beginning prevent them from having identical consonant sounds. As a result, they don't rhyme according to the traditional definition of rhyme as the repetition of specific consonant and vowel sounds in words.</s>
recipierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, 'recipiërend' and 'distantieerend,' do rhyme, as they share the consonant sound pattern "p t s r n g n d" at the end of the words, followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
evocerend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words, "evocerend" and "statica," do not rhyme as they have different consonant sounds in the first and second syllables, and no identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
contrarierend, remarquerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. This is because the two words have identical consonant sounds at the end: "r" sound. The only difference is the addition of the vowel "r" within the word, which does not change the overall rhyme. So, the last two letters of each word form a rhyming pair.</s>
recreeerden, macadamiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tieren, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words do rhyme. This is because they both follow the same pattern of ending with the same consonant (t in "tieren" and n in "slamieren") followed by the same vowel sound (/ɛ̃/) and then the same consonant. Rhyming is a poetic technique that involves words that end with the same combination of consonant and vowel sounds. In this case, "tieren" and "slamieren" both end with the same (/ɛ̃/) vowel sound and the same n/t consonant combination.</s>
ontroomt, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt" and "navel" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound and the consonants "t" and "v" are followed by the same consonant sound.</s>
quintolen, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. "Quintolen" and "handicaprace" both end in the -ap- sound. The "p" in the second word is pronounced like the "b" in "hamburger," and both share the same vowel sound at the end of the word.</s>
negerwijk, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "negerwijk" and "voorlig" do rhyme as they share the identical pattern of different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
pieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyming pattern in Dutch is ABAB, where A and B represent consonants and their vowel and consonant sounds. The words share this pattern, which is why they rhyme.</s>
pruimenboomgaarden, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. As you mentioned, both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them compatible in terms of rhyme.</s>
attentie, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || To determine if these Dutch words rhyme, we need to analyze the phonetic value of each syllable and its vowel sounds.

1. "attentie" has the following phonetic value: a [a], t [t], e [e], n [n], t [t], i [i].
2. "voorlichtte" has the following phonetic value: p [p], o [o], ua [o], vr [v], l [l], ɪk [ɪ], ɑ [a], t [t], e [e].

While both words start and end with the same vowel sounds (a and e), they have different consonant sounds between certain phonemes. Consequently, words like "attentie-voorlichtte" do not rhyme in Dutch due to the lack of consonant homophony and the presence of distinctive sounds in the two word components.</s>
kopieren, associeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
jut, smadelijkst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-smadelijkst" rhyme. This is because the -m- and -l- sounds are the same sound, even though they are at the end of the word. The other syllables also have the same vowel and consonant sound pattern, which is characteristic of a rhyming pattern.</s>
repliceren, sferen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "repliceren-sferen" do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound and end in the same consonant sound. Both words end in the sound /en/, which is the same in both words.</s>
toereikend, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "toereikend" and "voorlegt" do rhyme, as they have the same consonant sound ("vo") and vowel sound (in the "o" of "toereiken"). This is a common pattern in Dutch, where words with similar vowel (o) or consonant (vo) sounds often rhyme.</s>
planimetreer, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreer" and "duivelsklauw" rhyme because they have different consonants, "p" and "d," followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, "ae" in both cases.</s>
vlieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vlieren" and "passagieren" do rhyme, as they share the same consonant sound (both starting with the sounds /f/) followed by the identical vowel sound /i:/, making them homophones. The words are spelled differently, but they share the same pronunciation.</s>
toereikend, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "toereikend" and "ontduik," rhyme. They both share identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In each word, the consonant "r" followed by the same vowel sound and a different consonant sound at the end.</s>
diere, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words “diere-vlieren” do rhyme, as they share the identical pattern of consonant sounds followed by the same vowel sound "/ɛ/". Dutch is known for its regular and predictable system of rhymes, with words often ending in the same vowel sound.</s>
piepjongst, bijstanders, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "piepjongst" and "bijstanders" do rhyme in Dutch. The primary reason for this rhyme is because "j" at the end of "jongst" sounds identical to "j" at the beginning of "standers," and this change at the end does not change the underlying vowel sound, which makes them appear as a single syllable. Thus, the consonants are different, followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
wegdropen, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme since the vowel sound 'e' in both words is followed by the same consonant sound 'n'.</s>
associeren, intensifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "associeren" and "intensifieren" do rhyme. They have the same vowel sound (ei) and end with the same consonant sound (rn).</s>
binnenstroomden, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
spieren, Batavieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spieren" and "Batavieren" do rhyme. They have different consonants (s versus v) followed by identical vowel (ee) and consonant sounds (ien versus en). This rhyming pattern is common in Dutch poetry and songwriting.</s>
slamieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "slamieren" and "staffieren" do rhyme, as they both share identical vowel and consonant sounds. Both words end with the same vowel and consonant sequence (ee-re), thus forming a rhyming pattern in Dutch.</s>
zetterijen, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Zetterijen" and "indeuk" do rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sound pattern after the different consonants.

In the word "Zetterijen," the consonants are "Z" and "J." "Z" is followed by the same vowel sound (ä in "Zetterijen") and consonant sound as in "indeuk" with the "d" consonant.</s>
loopgravenstelling, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The vowel sound in both words is similar (e in "loopgravenstelling" and "kielvlak"), and both end with the consonant "n" after the vowel sound. However, the consonant sounds in these words are not identical, as "gravenstelling" includes the additional consonant sound "r" that is not present in "kielvlak." So, although they rhyme, there is a slight difference in the consonant sounds as well.</s>
bekwaamden, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "bekwaamden" and "ontruimt," do rhyme because they share the identical vowel and consonant sound pattern at the end. Although they have different consonant sounds at the beginning, the common ending creates rhyming sounds.</s>
deeltijdbanen, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because both end with identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically "e" and "n". However, the consonant sounds in the first word differ, as "t" in "deeltijdbanen" is a voiceless alveolar stop, and "v" in "voorlieg" is a voiced alveolar approximant.</s>
hyperboliseerden, suggereerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

Step 1: Count the number of same consonant letters in both words:
- hyperboliseerden (1 consonant letter)
- suggereerde (1 consonant letter)

Step 2: Check the consonant letters in the shared position:
- Both words have only one consonant at position 1 (the "p" and "r" in "hyperboliseerden" and "suggereerde", respectively).

Step 3: As there are only one different consonant letters in both words, it means that the consonant sounds are different.

Conclusion: 
The consonant sounds of "hyperboliseerden" are not identical to the consonant sounds of "suggereerde", so the words do not rhyme according to the rules of Dutch phonetics.</s>
tussenklanken, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tussenklanken" and "handicaprace" both rhyme. Here's a breakdown of the consonant-vowel-consonant patterns:

tussenklanken - [tʰu:sənkʰlaŋˈkeːn]
handicaprace - [ha:nɪdẽkˌpreːs]

In both words, the consonants are interchanged, and the final consonant sounds remain the same (in this case, -n and -s). The vowel sounds also remain the same (i.e., "e" in both words). So, they indeed rhyme in Dutch, as they follow the same letter patterns.</s>
treknet, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "treknet-vooreinde" do rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds and finish with the same vowel sound (e in both cases). In this case, the only difference between the two words is the addition of the suffix "-vooreinde," which means "at the beginning" or "out at the beginning" (for treknet it can be translated to "dragnet") and adds a syllable to the word. Despite this difference in length, the rhyme still holds due to the similarity in the consonant sounds and vowel sounds.</s>
belichtingstechnicus, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
Jut, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-planimetreer" rhyme.

The justification for this answer is the observation of the pattern in the syllable structure of the two words. In both words, each of the seven letters has a vowel-consonant combination, except for the final syllable, which is a consonant. The two words share the same vowel sound (i.e., /i/) within the first six syllables, with only the final consonant (L in "planimetreer" and the silent letter J in "Jut-planimetreer") changing, but this change does not introduce any new consonant sound. Due to the consonant combination consisting of consonants followed by the same vowel sound (e.g., J in "Jut", P in "planimetreer"), the Dutch words do indeed have the same rhyme scheme.</s>
gehydrateerde, gerendeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme as they have different consonants at the beginning and end of the words. The only vowel and consonant sound shared between the two words is the -ei- sound in gerendeerden. However, the consonants in the beginning and end of the words are different, which prevents them from rhyming.</s>
tempelieren, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme (tempelieren and slamieren) because they have identical consonant sounds in place, and different vowels before and after the identical consonant. This type of rhyme is known as "consonantal" or "spondee" in poetry.</s>
lootjes, nootjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "lootjes" and "nootjes" rhyme. They have different consonant sounds (l vs. n) but identical vowel and consonant sounds (/ɔltʃi/ vs. /nuotʃi/).</s>
asfyxieren, notifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. Here's why:

"Asfyxieren" has one "a" sound and one "e" sound in each part, and "Notifieren" also has a single "a" and "e" sound. However, "asfyxieren" consists of a "s" sound, "f" sound, "y" sound (which may be close to an 's' sound), "x" sound, and two "e" sounds. "Notifieren" consists of a "n" sound, two "e" sounds, "r" sound, and a "t" sound. These are different vowel and consonant sounds that do not rhyme with each other. Therefore, this pair of Dutch words do not rhyme according to the requirements you've mentioned.</s>
Jut, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, dear, these Dutch words don't rhyme. They don't share the same consonant sounds at the end, one ending in the letters '-lingestelde', while the other ends in '-nte.' These are two different words. In poetry, rhyme plays a significant role and helps create a pattern and flow. But in the given Dutch words, there's no perfect rhyme, making them different from each other.</s>
taswoning, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words, "taswoning" and "invul," have the rhyme scheme A-A. The words share the same vowel sounds (tas-o-ning and inv-u-l) and the same consonant sounds from before the vowel (tas- and inv-).</s>
narcotiseren, flocculeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

Step 1: Identify the pattern of the consonants in both words.
In both narcotiseren and flocculeren, the last two consonants, 'ts' and 'cr' respectively, are identical.

Step 2: Identify the pattern of the vowel sounds.
The vowel sounds in both words, 'a' and 'o', are identical.

Step 3: Compare the patterns.
Since both consonant patterns and vowel sounds are identical, the words rhyme (have the same basic pattern).</s>
seculieren, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In the words "seculieren" and "pluvieren", the only pair of consonants that remain silent between the word parts are "C" and "V". The silent consonants in Dutch are often represented by [h].</s>
distantieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "distantieren" and "convenieren," rhyme as they have the same final consonant and vowel sound. While the initial consonants differ, the internal structure remains consistent, giving the words a rhyming structure. This is a common occurrence in Dutch language, where the same structure can occur regardless of the words' meanings.</s>
gerendeerden, gepikeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have similar consonant and vowel sounds. 

In this case, the consonant sounds are "n" and "d," while the vowel sound in both words is "i." This pattern creates a simple rhyme scheme, where the consonant sounds create a pattern and the vowel sound in both words creates a matching pattern, creating a rhyme.</s>
meridionaal, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "indeuk" rhyme. They have the same consonant sound in the endings 'l' and 'k' making the vowel sounds different but still falling within the same rhyme scheme.</s>
discussieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "discussiëren" and "conveniëren" do rhyme because they have similar consonant sounds (sh-ch-j, ch-j) followed by the same vowel sound (i). This is an example of word-to-word syllabic rhyme in Dutch.</s>
zuursel, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "zuursel" and "statica," do rhyme. This is because the second letter of each word is the same, which is "s," and both words end with the same consonant (t). Vowels are identical in both words (-uursel and -statica).</s>
Jut, belichtingstechnicus, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "Jut-belichtingstechnicus" and "Belichtingstechnicus" have the same ending consonants (/ts/) and identical vowel sound (/ɛ/). The only difference is the addition of "Jut-" in the first word.</s>
wegdropen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
scharnieren, anjelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "scharnieren" and "anjelieren" have identical consonant and vowel sounds in the latter part of each word (the vowel 'e'). However, this doesn't necessarily imply that they rhyme. Word rhyme is more about the similarity in pronunciation, especially in the stressed syllables, and the endings mentioned above, although similar, do not meet the requirement for full rhyme. 

To be considered as "rhyming" words in the general linguistic sense, one word's ending must align precisely with the other word's ending, at every vowel or two consecutive consonants. These two words do not fit this criteria but are similar in sound due to the identical consonant and vowel sounds in the middle of both words. Essentially, these words don't rhyme strictly according to the linguistic definition.</s>
bedrijving, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have different consonants (b-d) followed by the same vowel (a) and consonant (r) sound.</s>
joysticks, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words do rhyme because both the endings of the words have identical consonant sounds ('sticks' and 'aarden'). Additionally, both words end with the same vowel sound, which contributes to their rhyme as per the rules of phonetic rhymes.</s>
associeren, varieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "associeren" and "varieren" rhyme with each other. They both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which makes them rhyme. In both words, the consonant sounds remain the same while the vowels change position.</s>
zenuwpijn, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as they both have the same vowel sound (a), and the difference in consonants (p in zenuwpijn and g in bagatellen) results in the identical consonant sounds in the end. This is a characteristic of onset-rime rhyme, where words have similar or identical sounds in the initial syllable.</s>
solmierend, discussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "solmierend-discussierend" rhyme because they have the same consonant-vowel-consonant pattern:

- "solme" and "discu" both share the consonant sounds ("s" and "d")
- "ierend" has the vowel sound "e"

The consonant sounds are the same, and the vowel sound is also the same in both words, making them rhyme.</s>
voorlieg, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlieg-radende" do rhyme as indicated by the identical vowel and consonant sounds. The words contain the consonant sequence "lv" followed by "nd" and end with the same vowel sound, which is the "e" in both words.</s>
slieren, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "slieren" and "pionieren," do rhyme as they share the same vowel sound "i" and differ mainly in the consonant sounds at the beginning (s and p).</s>
jut, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "brandverzekering" do rhyme. They both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the consonants "j" and "v" have the same pronunciation, and the vowels "a" and "e" both end in the same consonant, making the rhyme complete. The first part of these words, "brand," is an example of a "b" sound.</s>
slamieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "slamieren" and "manieren," do rhyme because they have similar consonant sounds and identical vowel sounds. "Slamieren" means "to slap" and "manieren" means "ways" or "manners."</s>
psychoanalytici, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
joysticks, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They have different consonant sounds in the beginning (S vs K) and a different consonant in the middle (S vs R). While both words have similar vowel sounds (aI and eA), the consonant sounds between the vowels are different, making them unrelated in terms of rhyme.</s>
detacheer, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "detacheer" and "taswoning" do not rhyme, as they have different consonants at the end. The main difference occurs in the last consonants "er" and "n" respectively. These consonants being different prevents these words from rhyming.</s>
ritmeren, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ritmeren" and "nadook" do rhyme, as they both share the same vowel and consonant sound pattern with different consonants preceding and following the identical vowel. This is known as vowel harmony and commonly found in Dutch language where a sequence of consonants followed by a vowel doesn't change.</s>
devieren, discussieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as both words share the consonant sound "s" followed by the identical consonant sound "z" and the same vowel sound "i" at the end.</s>
jatte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme.

Justification: "Jatte-nadook" consists of two words, "jatte" and "nadook." In Dutch, these words would be pronounced as ['jat.te] and ['na.dook] respectively. The "jatte" word has different final consonant "te" and "dook" has different initial consonant "na" compared to the identical vowel and consonant sounds which are expected for successful rhyming. Therefore, they do not rhyme.</s>
distantierend, renvooierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "distantierend" and "renvooierend" do rhyme. This is because they both have a similar vowel sound (e in 'distanierend' and 'renvooi') followed by a common consonant sound (r in both words).</s>
associeren, disharmonieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The pairing of "associeren" and "disharmonieren" consists of identical vowels and consonant sounds, which creates a rhyme.</s>
jut, kruisbessestruik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "jut-kruisbessestruik" rhyme because they have different consonants at the beginning (j and k), which are followed by identical consonant sounds (bb) and identical vowel sounds (e).</s>
verlichtten, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The consonant sounds in "verlicht" (lighted) and "anvijl" (swing) are both /v/ and the vowel and consonant sounds are the same. The only difference is the presence of the word "aan-" in between, which does not affect the rhyme.</s>
schmierden, begierden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'schmierden' and 'begierden' do rhyme. They have different consonants, as 'schmier' starts with 'm,' 'b' in 'begier'. They share identical vowel and consonant sounds, with the 'e' sound and the 'r' sound remaining the same in both words.</s>
