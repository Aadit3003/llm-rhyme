geblancheerd, gefosforesceerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geblancheerd" and "gefosforesceerd" rhyme. 

The rhyming pattern in Dutch is determined primarily by the vowel sounds: both words have the same vowel sound "/ɛ/" (pronounced like "ee"). The consonants are different, but the way the vowel sound interacts with the consonants results in the rhyme.</s>
triomfant, acceptant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words 'triomfant' and 'acceptant' do rhyme. The rhyme is created by a sound similarity in the final consonant of each word ('mf' together and 'nt' together), followed by the same vowel sound.</s>
gekaaide, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekaaide-zenuwpijn" rhyme. In this pair of words, the only difference lies in the first and last letters, which are silent and do not affect the pronunciation of the sound that follows. The consonant, which is "e" in both words, is identical, and the vowels, "aai" in the first word and "ei" in the second word, also have the same pronunciation. Therefore, they rhyme.</s>
fondant, contribuant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "fondant" and "contribuant" partially rhyme in Dutch. They have one shared consonant sound (/f/ in both words) and have one syllable with the same vowel sound (/ɛ̃/ in both words). The difference in the other syllables and most of the other consonant sounds makes them unrhyming for the traditional Dutch vowel-consonant rule.</s>
negerwijk, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "negerwijk" and "invul" rhyme. They both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
welbedachte, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. These Dutch words do not rhyme. The Dutch words "welbedachte" and "zenuwpijn" do not share any identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, as required for traditional phonetic rhyme. They resemble each other in the way that they both start with "w" followed by a consonant, but differ in their vowel sounds (e in "welbedachte" and i in "zenuwpijn") and the consonants at the end of the words (d in "welbedachte" and n in "zenuwpijn"). Rhyming is achieved when two words have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, not when they have the same initial consonant and a different vowel sound.</s>
gedisponeerd, geinfereerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gedisponeerd" and "geinfereerd" do rhyme because they have the same consonant-vowel-consonant rhyme scheme, with "dis" as the rhyme syllable.</s>
consacreert, gedemagnetiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the same pattern of consonant sounds followed by the same vowel sound at the end. In English, the equivalent phrase would sound like 'cun-dle'.</s>
ontruimt, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ontruimt" and "lawinegevaar" rhyme, as they have a similar sound structure with different consonants followed by an identical vowel and consonant pattern ("on-tr-u-im-t" and "la-win-ee-ge-vaar").</s>
constant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. While both words contain the same vowel sound (i.e., /ɪ/) and a corresponding consonant sound (i.e., /s/ in "constant" and /z/ in "chrysant"), the consonants ("t" and "s" in "constant" and "n" in "chrysant") are different, resulting in a non-rhyming phonetic pattern.</s>
contribuant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "contribuant" and "ontbrand" do rhyme. While they have different consonants at the beginning (c and t), the identical vowel sound (a) and the identical final consonant (d and r) create the rhyme.</s>
etnisch, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "etnisch-zenuwpijn" rhymes because it has two identical consonant sounds, 't' and 'n,' followed by the same vowel sound, 'ei.' The only difference is the palatalization of the letter 'j' between the consonants 'j' and 'z,' which can be considered part of the consonant sounds in this context.</s>
deposant, toppenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

In Dutch, a word rhymes if it contains the same vowel and consonant sound after the first syllable. 'toppen' has a similar structure to 'deposant', in particular the same vowel sound and last consonant sound, which makes them rhyme.</s>
volant, debitant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "volant" and "debiteant" do rhyme. They have different consonants, specifically the first one in "volant" having "v" and in the second one "d" and both words' corresponding consonants are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, these words rhyme in the traditional sense of the term. 

Furthermore, it is also to be noted that Dutch language does not fully follow the strict rules of stress and accent that some other languages have, but instead has a more flexible system of stress, with the last syllable being the most important one. These two words fall under Dutch's more flexible accent rules, making them effectively rhyming words, despite not following strict rules of stress and accent.</s>
desorganiseert, transmuteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "desorganiseert" and "transmuteert" have different consonants, but they share the same final consonant 'e'. The words have different initial consonants and vowels, which are 'd' and 't' in "desorganiseert" and 't' and 'r' in "transmuteert". However, they end with the identical consonant sound 'e', which is the final consonant in both phrases. Therefore, the two words do rhyme, although they do not follow the typical 'a, e, i, o, u, y' rhyme scheme.</s>
joysticks, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In the words "joysticks" and "onneembaarder," the consonant sounds "j," "s," "k," "t," "b," and "r" are the same, and the vowel sounds "o" at the beginning and "e" at the end are identical, thus making the words rhyme.</s>
fluidiseert, gefosforesceerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fluidiseert" and "gefosforesceerd" do rhyme, as they both have the same consonant sounds but different vowels.

In the words "fluidiseert" and "gefosforesceerd," the rhyme is achieved by the following structure:

fluidiseert:
- ph (as in phone) followed by the vowel sound of ae (as in tea)
- ui (as in due) followed by the vowel sound of ei (as in heel)
- d (as in dad) followed by the vowel sound of ei (as in heel)
- oon (as in moon)

gefosforesceerd:
- f (as in fail) followed by the vowel sound of ae (as in tea)
- os (as in loss) followed by the vowel sound of ei (as in heel)
- ph (as in phone) followed by the vowel sound of ei (as in heel)
- eer (as in hear)

There are only minor differences in the pronunciation, such as the sound of "u" in "fluidiseert" versus "eer" in "gefosforesceerd" or the "f" sound in both words. These differences do not change the overall structural rhyme between the two words.</s>
geblancheerd, gireert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geblancheerd" and "gireert" rhyme because both end in the vowel-consonant combination 'er'. They share the same consonants followed by the same vowel sound, which is a typical characteristic of rhyming words in Dutch.</s>
zuursel, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as you mentioned that they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Zuursel" and "indeuk" both end in the same vowel combination ("-eu"), making them rhyme in the Dutch language.</s>
treknet, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words treknet-statica have identical consonant sounds but different consonants at the beginning of each word, which is why they rhyme. They both have syllables that contain a "t" sound followed by a "s" sound, in this case treknet and sta and tic and a. The structure of the words and the positions of the "t" and "s" sounds create the rhyme.</s>
palissadeert, seksualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gezand, variant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gezand" and "variant" rhyme because both words end with the same repeating sequence of consonant and vowel sounds (z – a – n – t). In this case, the first word has an added silent "g" at the beginning, but this does not affect the rhyming quality of the words.</s>
etnisch, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds immediately after different consonants. 

Etnisch-voorlichtte - etnisch has the same series of vowels and consonants sounds (tn-ch) at the end, and

vorlichtte - voorlichtte both end with the consonant -t- and the vowel sequence -ligh-.</s>
antwoordend, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words are not rhyming. 

The words "antwoordend" and "sciopticons" are not rhyming because they have different final consonant sounds. In the first word, the final consonant is "nd," while in the second word, the final consonant is "icons." There is no identical vowel and consonant sound in these two words that would indicate rhyming.</s>
hygienist, psychometrist, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
overlig, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "overlig" and "invul" rhyme in Dutch. Both words have the same consonant sound and identical vowel sounds. In the word "invul", the "v" is pronounced like the "w" of "way". The only difference between the two words is the change in the consonant sound in the first letter, but it does not affect the rhyme.</s>
handicaprace, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because the consonants and vowel sounds in the beginning do not differ significantly. The words "handicaprace" and "versmallen" have the shared initial consonant "v," followed by different vowel sounds but identical sets of consonants (i.e., "handicap" vs. "versmallen"). This pattern of identical consonant sounds without significant differences in vowel sounds is a classic example of a rhyme in Dutch language.</s>
ontbeer, kandideer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The words "ontbeer" and "kandideer" both have the same consonant sounds in the end: -r. The only difference between the two words is the vowel sound before the -r, but it still aligns with the rhyme since these vowels are identical in both words.</s>
uitreikend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (ending in "e" and "eu" respectively).</s>
wegdruip, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "brandverzekering" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
duivelsklauwen, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. Although both words end with the same consonant sounds (both with the 'ng'), they have different consonants ('d' and 's') before the identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them not rhyming words.</s>
piepjongst, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "bagatellen" form a rhyme. 

In both words, the consonant pattern is almost identical. Both start with "p" and follow with two of the same vowel sound ("j"). However, in the second word, the final "n" makes a different consonant sound. This difference in consonant sounds is what makes the rhyming patterns different, but the overall sound remains the same.</s>
extraherend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. "Extraherend" has no vowel sound that matches the vowel sound in "aanvijl." The only similarity between the two words is the final consonant sound - which is an "l" sound.</s>
piepjongste, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongste" and "esthetiek" seem to rhyme. These words may have slightly different consonant sounds at the beginning, but the vowels ("ei" and "e") and the final consonant ("k" and "t") create similar sounds and rhythm.</s>
ontroomt, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "ontroomt-indeuk" does rhyme as it has two identical sounds: 'oo' at the end of both words. The first word, 'ontroomt,' ends with 't,' while the second word, 'indeuk,' ends with the same 'oo' sound. The difference lies in the single consonant that comes before the 'oo' sound.</s>
piepjongst, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "piepjongst-evocerend" rhyme as they end in identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically (/ɪ/ - /ɪ/) and (/ɒ/ - /ɒ/).</s>
solemniseer, reincarneer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, with only small differences in the consonant sounds.</s>
voorlichtte, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'voorlichtte' and 'ontduik' rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
kielvlak, meridionaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "meridionaal" do rhyme. They both end with the same consonant sound ("-a-") and the initial consonant sounds also share the same characteristic (both start with "k" and "m"). However, it's worth noting that while the words do seem to share this rhyme, the overall pronunciation and meaning of the words is still distinct, making them different words in Dutch.</s>
duif, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme since they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The words "duif-ordende" have the following syllable structure: duif (dwi: f) - ord (or: d) - ende (en: de). The different consonants are 'd' and 'r', and the identical vowel and consonant sounds are 'f'.</s>
joysticks, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "invul" do rhyme, as they contain the same vowel sound (ee) and the same consonant sound (ng) at the end of the words, but with different consonant sounds before each.</s>
gecarboniseerd, gepivoteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
stoot, galjoot, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "stoot-galjoot" do rhyme. They follow the pattern of a palindrome rhyme, where the words read the same way forwards and backwards. In this case, the palindromes are "oot" and "goot," and their rhyme is evident in their identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
piepjongste, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongste" and "voorlegt" do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme is based on the ending "-ongste" in the first word and the ending "-legt" in the second word.</s>
meridionaal, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words are spelled phonetically, making them rhyme, as they have a similar vowel and consonant sounds. "Meridionaal" has "ai" as its final vowel sound, similar to the "ee" in "invallen." Both words end with a voiced bilabial fricative (/v/) and a velar approximant (/ŋ/) sound.</s>
rentetarieven, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have identical consonant sounds (mentioned as "identical") after different consonant sounds (mentioned as "different consonants"). When comparing the words, we find "r" and "r" as repetition of same consonant sound in both cases, which makes the words rhyme. Hence, "rente tarieven" and "indeuk" rhyme in terms of consonant sounds followed by identical vowel sounds in Dutch.</s>
soupeert, geopponeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "soupeert" and "geopponeerd" rhyme in the Dutch language. This is because each word has a consistent pattern of consonant-vowel-consonant, where the consonants (S and G in this case) are followed by the same vowel sound (O), and another consonant (P and E). Therefore, the word pairs match in terms of their consonant/vowel/consonant syllable pattern.</s>
attentie, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie" and "kreupelbossen" do rhyme, because they share the same consonant and vowel sound patterns (consonant-vowel) at the end. In this case, both words end in the sequences "t"-"ie" and "o"-"r" respectively.</s>
gekant, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as the consonants are different (c 'k' and 'c') but followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds (a 'n' and 'n').</s>
rentetarieven, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rentetarieven" and "zenuwpijn" rhyme. The rhyme is based on the endings of the words "-e-" and "-u-," which are similar in both words. Although there are differences in the vowels and consonants between the two words, their shared ending and similar sounding vowel-consonant combination make them rhyme in Dutch.</s>
trompetboom, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "trompetboom" and "lawinegevaar" do rhyme because they have similar consonant and vowel sounds at the end. While "boom" and "gevaar" are distinct words, they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds: "oo" and "r". This creates a simple rhyme, despite the words being separate.</s>
versmallen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "versmallen" (version 1) and "nadook" (version 2) do not rhyme. The difference in the last consonant 'n' makes the sounds pronounced in the words dissimilar. The 'versmallen' phrase ends with 'nn', while the 'nadook' phrase ends with 'k', making them two separate syllables. Therefore, they do not rhyme.</s>
deposant, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deposant" and "bacchant" rhyme, as they have identical consonant sounds. However, both words are borrowed English words and not native Dutch words. In Dutch, the correct words that rhyme would be "gedeponeerd" (deposited) and "zakchante" (bacchante), which also have identical consonant sounds and a similar rhyme scheme.</s>
digitaliseert, geaccrediteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "digitaliseert-geaccrediteerd" rhyme. Both words have two syllables, ending with "er" (-tere). "Digitaliseert" contains the consonants "dig-i-tal-i-ser-t" and "geaccrediteerd" contains "ge-ac-cred-i-teerd." The final consonant "d" in each word is identical, creating the necessary rhyme.</s>
biometrie, lymfografie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "biometrie" and "lymfografie" do rhyme since they both have the same consonant sounds (bi-o-me-tie-lym-fog-ra-fee) and differ only in the vowel sounds which are identical.</s>
jubileert, seksualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "jubileert" and "seksualiseert" rhyme as they both end in the identical vowel and consonant sounds. They have different consonants at the beginning (J for jubileert and S for seksualiseert) but this does not prevent consistent consonant and vowel patterns at the end of the words, thus resulting in rhyme.</s>
piketteert, presseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words given, "piketteert" and "presseert", rhyme. This is because they share the exact same structure, with different consonant sounds but identical vowel and consonant sounds, making it a case of rhyme. In Dutch, this type of rhyme is called onslaught rhyme or "vrije onslaag" in Dutch. It doesn't follow the strict rules of Dutch rhyming patterns but can still create an effect in the language, mainly used in poetry or spoken words for effect.</s>
agiteert, presseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the same consonant sound and vowel sound at the end (e.g. -ert).</s>
zenuwpijn, bijstanders, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "bijstanders" do rhyme. They have a different consonant sound at the beginning ("z" and "b"), followed by the same vowel sound (both end with the vowel "i"), and finally have the same consonant sound at the end.</s>
antwoordend, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The words given, "antwoordend" and "invul," both have the same structure. They have different consonants ('n and 'v), but they follow the same sequence of identical vowel ('o') and consonant sounds ('r' in both words). Although the difference in consonants ('v' and 'nd') affects the way the sounds are realized, the overall patterns (similar vowel and consonant sounds) lead to the matching rhyme.</s>
fluidiseert, gesubsidieerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words, "fluidiseert" and "gesubsidieerd," rhyme as they have identical vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end. The only difference is the initial consonant "f" in "fluidiseert" v</s>
evocerend, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch word "evocerend" rhymes with "voorlieg" as both have nearly identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, even though the letters 'r' and 'g' are switched. In this case, the rhyme is considered near-rhyme or half rhyme, as the main emphasis is on the vowel sounds: both words end in '-e' (evocerend) and '-l' (voorlieg).</s>
beschietend, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words, beschietend-esthetica, do not have a proper rhyme structure. These words have different consonant sounds in the first word (beschietend) and identical consonant sounds in the second word (esthetica).</s>
melancholie, psychotherapie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "melancholie" and "psychotherapie" do rhyme in this way because they both have the consonant sounds 'mel', 'ancho', 'psy', and 'hero' followed by identical vowel sounds 'ee' and 'apie', respectively. Although their exact spelling is different, the sound patterns of the consonants and vowels create a rhyming pattern.</s>
gepsalmodieerd, gefalsificeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of the Dutch words you provided, "gepsalmodieerd" and "gefalsificeerd," have identical vowel and consonant sounds in their final syllable. In the case of "gepsalmodieerd," the final syllable is "-ieerd," and in "gefalsificeerd," it is "-eerd." These two syllables have the same vowel (i and e) followed by the same consonant sound (r) in both words. This is a rhyme in Dutch, as they share similar sonic qualities.</s>
confirmeert, illusioneert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "confirmeert" and "illusioneert" do rhyme. They have the following pattern:

- "confirmeert" : "con-form-ear-t"
- "illusioneert" : "ill-you-see-ert"

The first words have a few extra syllables, but for the syllables that rhyme, they are identical: "con-form-ear-t" and "ill-you-see-ert." This makes them rhyme words despite the longer word.</s>
orthografie, histopathologie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "orthografie" and "histopathologie" rhyme because they both have identical consonant sounds (orth, his, sto, pat, log-i-) followed by the same vowel sound (o). However, their meanings are different, with orthografie meaning "orthography" and histopathologie meaning "histopathology."</s>
entomografie, psychotherapie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "entomologie-psychotherapie" and "zoölogie" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

In both words, you can observe that the only difference is the change of one consonant sound for another. 'o', 'o' and 'o' respectively in the consonant clusters, 'tom', 'the', and 'log'. The pattern remains consistent within these words, thus the words rhyme.</s>
pikantst, briljantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words rhyme because they have the identical vowel and consonant sounds, i.e., the final sound '-tst' in both words, which is similar. However, the consonant sounds 'p', 'k', 'b', and 'j' are different. Therefore, the words are rhyming but not completely identical phonetically.</s>
gekalibreerd, culmineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekalibreerd-culmineert" do rhyme as they have the same final consonant sound (/riːd/) even though the consonants before the vowel change (the words are spelled [ɡekɑliːbreər]-[kulyːmineər] in Dutch). The fact that the vowels before and after the consonant-vowel combinations are identical and the consonants are unchanged (different, but not following a phonemic sequence) does not change the fact they have a common rhyme.</s>
detacheer, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer-treknet" do rhyme because they share identical consonant and vowel sounds with the final letters of the two words being -eer and -net respectively. The consonants in both words also follow each other without any change.</s>
attentie, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The two words both end with identical vowel sound and consonant sound: /ɛi/. In English, we might say "attend" and "quintet," and in Dutch, "quintol" is a synonym for "notebook." Both words can rhyme with each other, even though the consonants and vowels are different.</s>
retracteer, patroneer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both "retracteer" and "patroneer" rhyme as they share the consonant sound 'r' and the vowel sounds "e". The difference in the final consonant makes them distinct, but rhyme-wise, they meet the criteria of having similar sounding vowels/consonants in a pattern.</s>
fondant, sympathisant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The reason is that in both words, we can see that the letters 'f' and 's' are the vowel sounds followed by the consonants 'nd' and 'nt', respectively. The consonants are different, but they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
overspant, sympathisant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the ends:

"overspant" (over - span - tent)
"sympathisant" (sym - path - is - an - tent)

Both words end with "-tent", which creates the syllables "-tent" in both words. The syllables and sounds are therefore the same and match in rhyme in Dutch.</s>
geoculeerd, gedetoneerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "geoculeerd-gedetoneerd," do rhyme. This is because both words share the identical vowel, "e," followed by the same consonant sound.</s>
pruimenboomgaarden, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pruimenboomgaarden" and "sciopticons" rhyme because they share a common vowel sound (i in "gaarden" and "i" in "i" in "scioptic") and the remaining sounds (p and s) are consonants that occur often at the end of words. Justification:

Pruimenboomgaarden - pronounced [pruymənbuːmɡɑːdn̩]
Scopticons - pronounced [skaʊptiˈsɒns]

In this example, the vowel sound "i" in "gaarden" and "i" in "scioptic" are identical, and the consonant sounds "p" in "boom" and "s" in "i" and "s" in "ions" are the same.</s>
indeuk, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "indeuk" and "ordende" do rhyme because they have different consonant sounds at the beginning followed by the identical final consonant sound.</s>
schreeuweriger, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words schreeuweriger-statica do rhyme. 

'Schreeuweriger' consists of the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern "sch-ee-er" and the final "r" sound, while 'statica' follows the pattern "sta-ti-k" with an "a" sound at the end. Although they are not perfect or perfect palindrome rhymes since the 'er-' doesn't change its consonant sound and vowel sound, both words start with different consonants, but end in the same vowel sound, followed by similar consonant sounds (in this case 'r' sound from the first word also appears in the end of the second word).

Therefore, it's considered as a near-perfect rhyme between them.</s>
kwintalen, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. Both words start with the vowel 'a' and end with the consonant 'p.' The only difference between the two words is the consonant sound before the 'a.' In "kwintalen," the consonant is 'q,' and in "handicaprace" it is 'h,' but they produce similar sound when produced together.</s>
variant, contribuant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "variant-contribuant" do rhyme. They have different consonant sounds and identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
verlegd, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verlegd" and "sciopticons" rhyme because they have identical first and last consonant sounds (l and l), while the remaining consonants and vowels are different (v, g, c, p, t, i, n). This is an example of a "sound-based" or "vowel-based" rhyme.</s>
verluchtten, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verluchtten" and "esthetiek" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, known as consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) rhymes.</s>
wegdruip, generaalsepauletten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do not rhyme. However, they begin with almost the same consonant and vowel sound but end with different consonant sounds, indicating that the rhyming scheme is off. The word "generaalsepauletten" is not a correct Dutch word, which suggests that the original word ends with different consonant sounds to form a more common Dutch word or that it's misspelled, making the rhyme ineffective.</s>
fluidiseert, gefalsificeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the mentioned Dutch words rhyme. Both words have different consonants ("f", "s", and "t" respectively, followed by "r", "l", and "r" respectively for "fluidiseert" and "gefalsificeerd"), but the same vowel and consonant sounds (vowels: i and l, consonants: r and r). So, they rhyme with each other based on the rules of Dutch grammar and pronunciation.</s>
luitenant-adjudant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "luitenant," "adjudant," and "ontbrand" all rhyme because they have identical consonant and vowel sounds, even though the endings are different. In each word, the "-ee-" group of vowels sounds the same, which is why the words rhyme.</s>
repareert, europeaniseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "repareert" and "europeaniseert" do rhyme.

In this case, the rhyme goes as follows:

- "repareert" ends with "rt" and has a schwa sound (ə) in the middle.
- "europeaniseert" ends with "rt" and has an "r" sound in the middle and the schwa (ə) sound on the end.

As both words have the identical consonant "r" in the middle and same final "rt" sound, they rhyme according to Dutch phonetics and syntax.</s>
marineert, geaccrediteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "marineert" and "geaccrediteerd" rhyme in Dutch because they have the same final consonant sound (k in both) combined with the vowel sound of 'e'. However, they have different initial consonant sounds ('marin' in the first word and 'g' in the second), ultimately making them distinct words.</s>
framepjes, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
arroseert, hydrateert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "arroseert" and "hydrateert" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Both words end with the same consonant (r) and the same vowel sound (e).</s>
welhebbende, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the provided Dutch words "welhebbende-ontruimt" do not rhyme. 

Rhyme, in linguistics, refers to the similarity or mutual correspondence between the syllables of words at the end of a line of verse, both in terms of their phonetic quality (the consonant sound before the vowel) and their vowel patterns (the vowel sound and its duration). 

In English, some common rules help us to determine which words may rhyme. An important rule here is the "liquid" vowels i.e., "l" and "r". It was traditionally thought that words ending in liquids couldn't truly rhyme with words ending in other liquids. However, this rule has some exceptions.

In "welhebbende-ontruimt", both words don't have the same vowels or consonants in the end which leads to non-rhyming words. Rhyming words would typically have an identical pattern of vowels and consonants at the end.</s>
kelderdeur, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kelderdeur-ontroomt" rhyme. 

Both words have the identical vowel sounds "ee-uh," followed by the same consonant sounds "k," "l," and "r." The only difference between the two words is the final consonant, which changes from "t" to "mm," but these final sounds do not interfere with the general rhyme of the words since they are phonetic rather than meaningful.</s>
wegdruip, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "ontduik" rhyme. They have different consonants but the same vowel and consonant sounds, creating a rhyming pattern.</s>
deposant, fazant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deposant" and "fazant" do rhyme, as they share similar consonant and vowel sounds. In this case, the only difference between the two words are the final consonant ("s" in "deposant" and "n" in "fazant"). This difference in final consonant doesn't prevent the words from having the same rhyme structure, with identical consonant sounds before the final consonant. The rhyme pattern of both words is [d] / [f].</s>
exhibeert, mediatiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The words "exhibeert" and "mediatiseert" have identical final consonants (rt), a common factor leading to syllabic rhyme. The consonant/vowel pattern remains the same for both words, and they even have similar sentence structures that rhyme.</s>
etnisch, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "etnisch-joysticks" do rhyme. They have different consonant sounds before the identical vowel and consonant sounds (e and s).</s>
vercommercialiseer, ruineer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "vercommercialiseer" (commercialize) and "ruineer" (ruin) do not rhyme as they have different consonants followed by different vowel and consonant sounds. "Vercommercialiseer" has the consonant sounds /bʁ/ (commercialize) and /ʁ/ (ruin), while "ruineer" has the consonant sounds /ʁ/ (ruin) and /j/ (ruin).</s>
exhibeert, eclipseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "exibeert" and "eclipseert" do rhyme in Dutch. They share the same consonant sounds (/zəb/ and /ɛks/ respectively) followed by identical vowel sounds (/iː/ in both cases). Rhyming allows for a greater emotional response while listening to or reciting the text.</s>
afgrijzenwekkendere, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds (f, r, t) and the vowel sound (e) at the end. However, the meaning of 'afrijzen' and 'ontroomt' is different. 'Afrijzen' translates to 'to freeze' while 'ontroomt' translates to 'delivers over'. Therefore, these words do not rhyme in terms of their meanings.</s>
geencadreerd, radeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geencadreerd" and "radeert" rhyme. They have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of each word, making them phonetically alike. Specifically, they differ by a single consonant: "ge" in "geencadreerd" changes to "r" in "radeert." This repetition of the consonant "r" at the end of each word creates the phonetic similarity that results in rhyme.</s>
piepjongste, attentie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
duif, generaalsepauletten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "generaalsepauletten" do rhyme. Both words have the same first syllable (du-if and ge-ne-ra-al-se-pau-letten) and identical consonant sounds at the end (if and len-te-nen), followed by the same vowel sound (ee in both words).</s>
zouterijen, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zouterijen" and "treknet" are indeed rimes with different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. They have the same first sound as in "zouterijen" and "treknet", which is a voiced velar fricative (voiced uvular fricative), or /x/.</s>
jut, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "jut-ontroomt" rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds, regardless of the position of their consonants. The word "jut-ontroomt" does not follow the strict ABOE pattern of Dutch, and that is why it rhymes and isn't an exact match for the word "mol-ontroomt."</s>
constant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the two Dutch words "constantly-ontbrand" do not rhyme as they don't share the same consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
alieneert, europeaniseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "alieneert" (alleien-ert) and "europeaniseert" (europa-niz-e-eert) have a common ending sound (-eert), and this ending causes the overall rhyme. Both words end with a vowel sound and a consonant sound, which leads to an identical pattern of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
overlig, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "overlig" and "ontduik", rhyme because they have the same ending and the same consonant sounds following a vowel sound. The only difference between the two words is the added letter 'e' which results in the same ending and consonant sounds.</s>
gemeste, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gemeste" and "sciopticons" rhyme. Both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds:

1. The consonant 'm' and 's' are the only consonant differences in "gemeste."
2. The vowel 'e' in both words is identical.
3. The similar consonant sounds at the end of the words create a short-vowel, long-syllable sound to round out the rhyme.</s>
zweit, luciditeit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zweit-luciditeit" rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds in the beginning (zweit) and identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end (luciditeit).</s>
quintolen, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "quintolen" and "handicaprace" do rhyme. The rhyming pattern can be seen as CVC-VC. 

In the first word, "quintolen," quint is a Dutch word meaning "five" and also rhymes with "penultimate," and the ending "olen" has a long vowel and rhymes with "molen" or "vocabulary."

In the second word, "handicaprace," "handicap" is Dutch and rhymes with "bantam" (although it doesn't have the same consonant pattern), and the ending "race" has the same pattern as "quintolen" with a long vowel sound and a consonant followed by the same vowel and consonant pattern as "quint." 

So, they both have the CVC-VC rhyming pattern.</s>
duif, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme scheme is as follows: both words have the same syllable construction with the same vowel (ie) sound and identical consonants (f and f).</s>
sympathisant, contribuant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "sympathisant" and "contribuant" do rhyme. Though they are spelled differently, the final vowels and consonants sound the same (apain to the ear). They represent a common form of non-stressed rhyme in Dutch, a phenomenon known as "liquid" rhyme or "syllabic closure." This type of rhyme often occurs with verbs and adjectives.</s>
kielvlak, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "esthetica" do rhyme due to the identical consonant sounds combined with the same vowel sound in both words.</s>
gekant, luitenant-adjudant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In each word, the "e" and "t" represent the same consonant sounds that are followed by the identical "a" sound in both words. So, they rhyme.</s>
mant, luitenant-adjudant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "mant-luitenant-adjudant" do rhyme. They all have the same ending in terms of vowels and consonants, resulting in consonant and vowel sounds being identical:

- "mant" followed by "-luitenant" and "-adjudant" all share the same vowel sequences "ant-luit-" and "-adjun-," followed by identical consonant sounds.</s>
voorlieg, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlieg-versvoeten" rhyme. They have different consonants (v/f) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/ie/-/ie/).</s>
planimetreer, kruisbessestruik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme.

The word "planimetreer" and "kruisbessestruik" have different consonants at the beginning of both words ("Plan-" vs. "Kruis-," and "mets" vs. "Bessel"). Although they both end with the similar sounds of "oo" and "ik," the sounds in between the consonants are quite different, making them not rhyme.</s>
trompetboom, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words, "trompetboom" and "voorlichtte", have the same consonant sounds: "m" and "t" followed by a vowel "o" in "boom" and "lichtte". This creates a rhyme, where the pattern of consonant and vowel sounds remains the same.</s>
gekant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, gekant-ontbrand, do rhyme. They have the same vowel sound "a" (which is different from the front vowel sound "ä") and the same consonant sound "t" at the end. This type of rhyme is called a spondee, and it is common in Dutch poetry.</s>
geamortiseerd, gepivoteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geamortiseerd" and "gepivoteerd" rhyme due to the similarity of their consonant and vowel sounds. They each have a series of consonants (GMRTZHR and PVMTR respectively) followed by the same vowel sound (/eː/) and identical consonant (/t/ and /p/ respectively) at the end. This creates a rhyming pattern that is characteristic of Dutch language and its phonetic properties.</s>
kelderdeur, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kelderdeur-esthetiek" rhyme since they have the same vowel sound at the end ('ee' in both words), even though the consonants are different ('r' in the first and 't' in the second word). However, the Dutch language is highly phonetic, and even small changes in consonants can change the pronunciation, making these words sound similar.</s>
plantluis, rentetarieven, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "rentetarieven" do rhyme. They both have three syllables, the first two syllables "plant" and "luis" consist of /an/ and /eis/ respectively, and the third syllable "e-even" consist of /i:n/ and /e:n/ respectively, sharing identical vowel and consonant sounds for the word "even". The same applies to "rent" and "etaria", except that "rent" has the initial consonant /r/ which is absent in "plantluis", giving them a slightly different sound in the first syllable.</s>
debitant, convenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "debitant" and "convenant" rhyme because they have the identical consonant sounds and they have the same vowel sound at the end of each word:

debitant - /debiˈtan(t)/ ('debi' is the homophone)
cohenant - /ˈkohən(t)/

In both words, consonant sounds /debi/ and /kohən/ are identical, consonant /d/ and /k/ are pronounced similarly. The vowel sound at the end /i/ or /ə/ is the same in both words. The letters 't' and 'n' are different in the words, but they have identical pronunciation. This makes the rhyme possible.</s>
vrijheidsklasse, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words vrijheidsklasse-ontduik do rhyme because of the identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. 

In the specific words provided, "vrijheidsklasse" and "ontduik" both have a similar ending and rhyme when pronounced. This happens when ending consonants (the "d" in "vrijheidsklasse" and the "k" in "ontduik") are identical and identical vowels (the "e" or "i" in both cases) are followed by similar consonant sounds.</s>
pruimenboomgaarden, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pruimenboomgaarden" and "voorlig" do rhyme because they both feature an identical vowel sound - "ui" - at the end. In English, it can be referred to as a "stressed diphthong." This creates a rhyme between the words. Here is an example: "pretty, pretty."</s>
kelderdeur, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kelderdeur" (meaning "basement door") and "sciopticons" (meaning "cyborg") rhyme. Both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically e, r, and n in the first word, and s, i, p, o, t, and c in the second word.</s>
toereikend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toereikend-esthetiek" rhyme because they have a similar end or last consonant followed by the same last vowel and consonant sound. To put it into more explicit terms, these words "toereikend" and "esthetiek" rhyme when you put the "t" and the "k" and then the same "i" sound together like this: "toe rie kend - es teh tiek". So the "t" in "toereikend" matches with the "t" in "toe", the "k" in "toereikend" matches with the "k" in "toe", and the "i" in "toereikend" matches with the "i" in "te". This gives a perfect rhyme between the two words.</s>
meridionaal, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They have different consonant sounds before the identical vowel and consonant sounds, leading to different syllables.</s>
acceptant, variant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "acceptant" and "variant" do rhyme in Dutch, as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. The difference in the consonant sounds is not enough to prevent the words from rhyming in this context.</s>
kolendampvergiftiging, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kolendampvergiftiging" and "esthetiek" do have similar consonant and vowel sounds. The root of "kolendampvergiftiging" shares a similar ending with the last part of "esthetiek," which makes them rhyme in Dutch language. However, to accurately label them as rhyming, as their vowel sounds are not identical, we should adjust the answer as follows: "kolendampvergiftiging" and "esthetiek" rhyme with a small variation in vowel sounds.</s>
asociaalst, feudaalst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "asociaal" and "feudaal," do have the same vowel and consonant sound at the end, which makes them rhyme. These particular words, along with "arachnida," "cannada," and "Ecuador-a-a," are known as "V" rhymes, also known as V-rhymes. This type of rhyme involves identical vowel and consonant sound at the end of the words.</s>
meridionaal, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
consolideert, geremitteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "consolideert" and "geremitteerd" do rhyme in Dutch.

The justification is based on the fact that "consolideert" and "geremitteerd" have identical consonant sounds except for the change of one consonant. Both words have the same ending vowel "e" which contributes to their final sound being identical. In linguistics, this pattern is considered a kind of rhyme referred to as "near rhyme". Dutch language also allows the sound changes that align the two words in the case of this rhyming pattern.</s>
jatten, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatten" and "esthetiek" do indeed rhyme. They have different consonants, as "jat," "te," and "tiek" are distinct sounds. However, both follow the same pattern of ending with the same vowel sound ("tiek") and the same consonant sound ("te").</s>
ingestort, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "ingestort" and "esthetiek" do rhyme. 

In this case, "ingestort" and "esthetiek" both end with the sequence "tiek," which constitutes a case of syllabic rhyme, or rhyming by identical syllables. Syllabic rhyme often involves differing consonant sounds, yet identical vowels and consonants at the end of syllables. Here, the consonant sounds are "ts" whereas the vowel sounds remain the same (i.e., "ɛ"). 

In this specific example, "ingestort" means "violently upset," and "esthetiek" means "aesthetics."</s>
kielvlak, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme. Both words have different consonants (k and -gh in "kielvlak" and -ck- in "negerwijk") followed by identical vowel sound (i in both) and the same consonant sound (l in both).</s>
debitant, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "debitant" and "bacchant" do rhyme. They have different consonants but have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, which makes them rhyme. 

Analyzing the consonant sounds in both words:

- "debitant" consists of the consonants 'de', 'bi', 'ta', 'nt'.
- "bacchant" consists of the consonants 'ba', 'ch', 'an', 't'.

The pattern of vowels and consonants is similar in both words, which is why they rhyme in Dutch.</s>
plant, contribuant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plant" and "contribuant" do rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sound pattern, although the endings are different. 

Here is a comparison of their consonant and vowel sounds:
- Plant: /pla.nt/ - /pla/ initial consonant, /nt/ final consonants and vowels are the same
- Contribuant: /kənˈtrɪbuːənt/ - /kən/ initial consonant, /trɪbuː/ final consonants are identical ( /nt/ is the same letter, but pronounced differently than in "plant")

This change in pronunciation results in the words rhyming, even though they don't share the exact same sound.</s>
koelkamer, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words rhyme (koelkamer-handicaprace) for the following reason: Both words have the same vowel combination (e) followed by different consonant patterns for the word to rhyme. The main syllable has the same vowel sound (K-E) and the different consonant sounds (K-M-A-R in the first word and H-A-N-D-I-C-A-P-R-A-C-E in the second word) that are then followed by the same consonant sound "E" in the end.</s>
convenant, sympathisant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
arroseert, transmuteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "arroseert" and "transmuteert" do not rhyme. 

Rhyme is defined as pairs of words that share identical consonants at the end of a syllable and follow identical vowel sounds. In this case, the final consonant of "arroseert" is "e", and the final consonant of "transmuteert" is "u". The common vowel sound is "tr". However, they are not identical because "transmuteert" has an additional "e" sound which is different. 

Thus, these words are not considered to be a part of this 'identical consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds' rhyme type.</s>
saboteert, palissadeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme since they have the same consonant sounds and different vowel sounds in the end.</s>
fazant, bestand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
psychoanalytici, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "psychoanalytici-invallen" do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds after the consonants 'c' and 'v'. In this case, both words share the identical vowel sound of 'i' and consonant sounds of 'a' and 'n' in the end.</s>
passeer, reincarneer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "passeer" and "reincarneer" do have identical vowel and consonant sounds. They are spelled differently, but the vowels and consonants remain the same in each word, making them rhyme.</s>
gecontamineerd, geobjectiveerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both "gecontamineerd" and "geobjectiveerd" have different consonant sounds in their beginnings (c vs g), but they both end with identical consonant and vowel sounds (r-ed). This is known as a consonantal rhyme scheme, where the end sound is similar but the initial consonant is different.</s>
nadook, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'nadook-ingestelde' do rhyme, as indicated by their identical internal rhyme (i.e., they both internally rhyme with the same vowel and consonant sounds, even though the consonants in each word are different).</s>
kielvlak, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "kielvlak" and "toereikend" do rhyme. They both follow the pattern "eik-l-ik-n-d" where the consonants are similar, and only the vowel changes.</s>
criant, geplant, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No.

The words "criant" and "geplant" do not rhyme in this instance, as they have different consonant sounds before and after the identical vowel sound (i.e., cr and pl). In this case, the words would be considered to be "sibilant-onset" words, where the consonant sound before the vowel is the same, making it a non-rhyming pair.</s>
kruisbessestruiken, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They do not have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In "kruisbessestruiken," the different consonants come before the identical vowel and consonant sound (t at the end). In "nadook," the different consonants come after the identical vowel and consonant sound (o at the end).</s>
etnisch, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds before the identical vowel-consonant sounds. The first word "etnisch-bedienaars" has "t," "n," and "s" sounds, while the second word "bedienaars" has "b," "d," and "t" sounds. Since these vowel-consonant combinations are distinct in both words, they do not rhyme.</s>
overspant, extravagant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "overspant" and "extravagant" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (a) and the same consonant sound (p) at the end of the words. The differences in the consonants are not enough to affect the rhyme.</s>
gekant, bestand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekant-bestand" rhyme because although the consonants are different (T and F), the vowel and consonant sounds are identical (.T and .ST). The presence of identical consonant sounds following vowel sounds constitutes a rhyme in the Romance language.</s>
gekant, convenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekant" and "convenant" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (ending in the same consonant). The consonants at the end are "k" and "n" respectively.</s>
bestaand, misgaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The Dutch words "bestaand" and "misgaand" do rhyme, as they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Both words end with the same combination of vowels (eidentical) to create the same rhyme.</s>
Italianisant, immigrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "Italianisant" and "immigrant" do not rhyme. They have different consonant sounds and vowel sounds, making them an "x" and a "g" respectively, which do not create a rhyming effect.</s>
piepjongst, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "naduiken" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds:

- "piepjongst" has the sound of "pi" followed by "jongst," which can be pronounced as "jong," similar to the sound made in "naduiken."
- "naduiken" has the sound of "nu" followed by "iun," which can also be pronounced as "jong."</s>
gezand, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
binnenstroomden, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "innenstroomden-esthetica" rhyme in Dutch. They are an example of homophony, where the pronunciation of the consonants and the vowels are identical in both words.</s>
cyclotrons, bidons, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "cyclotrons" and "bidons" do rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds despite having different consonants before the identical vowel sound. The consonants in both words are "k" and "n," followed by the vowel "o" and the consonant "o."</s>
jut, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "jut-ritmeren" and "rit-mediteren" share a common rhyme pattern where the same consonant sound ('t') is followed by the same vowel sound ('u'). In English, a 'y' sound is also similar to the 'u' sound. However, the pronunciation of 'u' can vary in different languages, so in other languages or for native speakers, the rhyme would not be the same.</s>
zenuwpijn, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zenuwpijn" (nerve pain) and "interimaat" (interim) do rhyme, as they have the same pattern of vowel sounds followed by identical consonant sounds (both end in -n-), and different consonants before the vowels.</s>
gelukzoekster, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words do rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the ending syllables - "ter" and "oom" in "gelukzoekster" and "boom" in "trompetboom." The consonants before the identical vowels are different, as seen in the letters "g," "l," and "t" in the first word, and "k," "p," and "t" in the second word.</s>
regimentscommandant, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "regimentscommandant-invul" rhyme in Dutch because, starting from the beginning, you find identical vowel and consonant sounds in both words - "regiments" and "commandant," and "invul" means "unshakable."</s>
meert, gireert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meert-gireert" do rhyme, because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Meert" is "heart" and "gireert" is "turned." The similarities in sounds come from the ending with the same consonant "r."</s>
agiteert, gefosforesceerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants (i.e., the t in "agiteert" and the f in "gefosforesceerd") followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (i.e., o in the first word and e in the second). The final consonant sounds, g and s respectively, are also the same, contributing to the overall rhyme.</s>
ordenden, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ordenden" and "invul" rhyme. Both have the identical letters 'n' and 'v,' which create a rhyme between the words.</s>
volant, constant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "volant" and "constant" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

Justification:
- "volant" and "constant" share the same vowel sound ("o") at the end.
- Both words start with the same consonant sound: "vo" for "volant" and "co" for "constant".

Therefore, the differences in consonants (specifically, the "l" in "volant" and the "c" in "constant") create a rhyme when the identical vowel and consonant patterns are accounted for.</s>
vergokte, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They both have the same vowel sound at the end (ee in "vergokte" and "trompetboom"), and they both end with the same consonant sound (p and t in "vergokte" and "trompetboom"). The consonants in the beginning may be different, but the sounds are the same, which rhymes the words in Dutch poetry.</s>
flagrantst, abundantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "flagrantst" and "abundantst" do rhyme. They have different consonants (f, l, g, r, a, b, t, n), but the vowel sounds (/æ/ and /æ/) remain identical, and the consonant sounds at the end of each word (/n/ and /n/) also sound the same.</s>
gewaardeerd, marineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gewaardeerd" and "marineert" do rhyme. Both words have the same consonant sounds (G-V-R-D and M-R-N-R-T) and follow the same pattern of vowel sounds (ee-a and a-e).</s>
loopgravenstelling, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loopgravenstelling" and "invul" (meaning "excavation" and "filling in" respectively) do rhyme.</s>
riskantst, irrelevantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "riskantst" and "irrelevantst" rhyme as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds after the consonants "r", "s", and "t". They are not necessarily homophones, but they fulfill the same phonemic requirements and can be read and pronounced correctly as such.</s>
etnisch, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-zouterijen" do rhyme, as they have the pattern of consecutive vowels and consonants which is known as a near-rhyme. In this case, the sound after "z" in both words is identical.</s>
jut, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-ingestelde" do rhyme, specifically they share the same vowel and consonant sounds, which follow the rhyme scheme known as "cvc" or "consonant-vowel-consonant."</s>
rekestrant, extravagant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
quintolen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "quintolen" and "aanvijl" do rhyme because the identical vowel and consonant sounds in the last two syllables make their consonant patterns the same, even though the consonants are different. The -o- in "quintolen" and "vijl" form the vowel sound (long e: ɛ), and the identical consonant pattern after that is [t] for both words. In conclusion, "quintolen" and "aanvijl" can be considered a minor form of rhyme known as a spondaic meter because of their repeated vowel and consonant patterns albeit with different consonants.</s>
saboteert, geextensiveerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because of the identical consonants at the end (t and r), followed by identical vowel sounds (both ending in -e).</s>
etnisch, smadelijkst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
triomfant, mant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "triomfant" and "mant" rhyme because they have an almost identical structure, with different consonants followed by the identical consonant sound "t". The vowels in each word are different - "i" in "triomfant" and "a" in "mant", but this is not enough to break the rhyme.</s>
palissadeert, gepivoteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "palissadeert-gepivoteerd" do rhyme, as they have the same ending sound (t), and the following consonant and vowel sounds are identical.</s>
zenuwpijn, beschietend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "beschietend" rhyme.

They share the same last two syllables ("-pijn" and "-nd"), which have identical consonant and vowel sounds. In Dutch phonetics, this is called a "schwa" sound, where the vowel is short and neutral, allowing it to fit in various consonant clusters.</s>
etnisch, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-ingestorte" rhyme, as they both end in the consonant sounds [st] followed by the vowel [o].</s>
sympathisant, extravagant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sympathisant" and "extravagant" do have the same consonant sound with different letters but identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end. Both words end with the same consonant sound "ant" and the vowel sound "ea."

The pronunciation can be demonstrated as follows:

- "S" "p" "a" "t" "h" "i" "s" "a" "n" "t" - sounds the same in both words
- "e" "t" "r" "v" "a" "g" "a" "n" "t" - sounds the same letters but different positions in each word

So, justifying the answer, "sympathisant" and "extravagant" rhyme because both have the same consonant sounds "ant" as the endings, although the letters are in different positions.</s>
fazant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fazant-ontbrand" rhyme. This pairing of distinct, yet consonant-identical sounds is an example of a slender rhyme in Dutch, which is known to occur more frequently than more traditional types of rhyming found in languages like English.</s>
riskantst, intrigantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "riskantst" and "intrigantst" do rhyme since they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ("risk-ant-st" and "intrig-ant-st"). In this case, "k" and "g" are the different consonants in the words.</s>
platteband, variant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "platteband-variant" do rhyme. The rhyme comes from the consonant clusters "pl" in "platteband" and "pn" in "variant". Both of these consonant clusters end with identical vowels (a for "platteband" and e for "variant"), resulting in a palindrome-like effect. In linguistic terms, this type of rhyme is known as a 'vowel-consonant' rhyme.</s>
gekant, constant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekant-constant" rhyme, as they follow the pattern of different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sound. This is called syllabic rhyme or near-rhyme. The main differences in their pronunciation are in their consonant sounds at the end, but the overall vowel and consonant sounds in each word are similar.</s>
debitant, gebrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "debitant-gebrand" rhyme as they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the rhyme comes from the final two consonant sounds, "d" (in "debitant") and "r" (in "gebrand").</s>
welhebbende, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words, welhebbende-voorlieg, do not rhyme. They share the same vowel and consonant sounds, but there is a difference in the consonant sound, resulting in lack of rhyme. "Welhebbende" starts with the consonant sound "w," while "voorlieg" starts with the consonant sound "v."</s>
implementeer, dupliceer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "implementeer" and "dupliceer" do rhyme because they have different consonants (im- and du- followed by the first phoneme ee- in both words) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (ee-er and pu-cer). The last letters of the two words, -ee- and -pu-, also sound the same in Dutch.</s>
ontstaand, gaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words ontstaand and gaand do indeed rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds. The words have different consonant sounds at the beginning (t and n, respectively), but this is balanced by identical consonant sounds at the end, making the rhyme possible.</s>
jut, meridionaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The reason is that the consonant sounds in "jut-" and "meridionaal" are not the same. In "jut-", the "j" and "t" make different consonant sounds. Therefore, they do not have the exact same consonant sounds in their rhyme. So, they do not rhyme.</s>
jut, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
ontroomt, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words do have a pattern of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme. The words are "ontroomt" and "aanvijl."</s>
romantiseert, antedateert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
plantluis, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the terms plantluis and verlichtte in the phrase plantluis-verlichteen both rhyme as they have the same vowel sound, "ee" and consonant sound, "t" which ends the word rhymes in both. Therefore, the words have different consonants but the same vowel and consonant sounds, hence they rhyme.</s>
abondantst, degoutantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
fazant, plant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gecreosoteerd, seksualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gecreosoteerd" and "seksualiseert" do rhyme.

Let's break down the words:

- "gecreosoteerd" (ge-kroos-o-teert) has the rhyme pattern "cr-oe-teert."
- "seksualiseert" (sek-sue-a-leer) has the rhyme pattern "sek-sue-a-leer."

Since both end with the same consonant-vowel-consonant syllable pattern, they rhyme.</s>
pantheist, avantgardist, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'pantheist' and 'avantgardist' do rhyme. Both words have different consonant sounds ('ph' vs. 'v') followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ('theist' after 'p' and 'tgardist' after 'g'). Dutch, like other Romance languages, has unique features, such as the palatalization that can affect the pronunciation when words are combined or changed. In this specific case, both words are not altered in phonetic features, hence they rhyme.</s>
kielvlakken, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlakken" and "sciopticons" rhyme. 

Explanation:
- Both words have similar consonant sounds at the end: "ak" in "kielvlakken" and "ak" in "sciopticons."
- The vowels "e" in "kielvlakken" and "o" in "sciopticons" are identical and play a part in the rhyme. 

However, the words are not exact rhymes, as each word has a different word-initial consonant – "kiel" and "sci" respectively.</s>
welbedachte, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'welbedachte-esthetica' do rhyme as they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In English, the rhyme scheme would be described as "consonant-vowel-consonant". The first word 'welbedachte' begins with the consonant sound "wel" and has the vowel sound "e" before the final consonant "t". The second word 'esthetica' begins with the consonant sound "e" and has the identical vowel sound "e". Both words have the consonant sound "t" at the end, but in different positions. Hence, the Dutch words rhyme with each other due to the combination of consonant and vowel sounds, which aligns with the characteristics of a rhyme.</s>
escamoteert, comprimeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. While not necessarily identical in their vowel sounds, they both end with a repetition of the same consonant sound, which is the crucial characteristic of a rhyme. In "escamoteert," the "t" sound is repeated at the end of the word, and in "comprimeert," the repeated "r" sound is the same.</s>
toerekent, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toerekent" and "esthetiek" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the ends of the words. The last letter consonant "n" and the vowel "e" create the rhyme.</s>
detacheer, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "ontduik" rhyme. In this case, the only difference in the syllables is the "er" at the end of "detacheer" which causes the two words to have the same consonant sounds. The only change is that "ontduik" has a different vowel sound in the first syllable.</s>
wegdruip, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words, "wegdruip" and "sciopticons," have a similar pattern of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

In the first word, "wegdruip," the syllables are as follows: weh (consonant) - gang (consonant and vowel that sound identical) - rip (consonant). 

In the second word, "sciopticons," the syllables are as follows: sci (consonant) - optic (consonant and vowel that sound identical) - ons (consonant). 

Since the consonant sounds remain consistent, this makes these words rhyme in the Dutch language.</s>
toppenant, acceptant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The two words "toppenant" (tapping) and "acceptant" (accepting) have the same vowel sounds "e" and "a" and end with the same consonant sounds "p" and "nt". Both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds in their final syllable.</s>
computeriseer, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have a different number of consonant sounds before a repeated consonant and vowel sound. The former word, "computeriseer," has one consonant sound ('p') followed by a repeated vowel sound and consonant ('uiterlijk') to form the rhyme, while the latter, "aanvijl," has one consonant sound ('aan') followed by the repeated consonant and vowel sound to form the rhyme. Therefore, these words rhyme in the Dutch language.</s>
bacchant, extravagant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bacchant" and "extravagant" do have similar consonant and vowel sounds, even though they belong to different consonant groups, as follows:

1. "Bacchant" has "B" and "C" consonants, while "extravagant" has "X" and "V" consonants.

2. Both words have the identical vowel sound "A" and then "N" or "R" consonant sounds. 

Because both words involve this identical pattern in their structure, they rhyme, despite containing different consonant groups.</s>
ongeemancipeerd, alumiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have the same consonant and vowel sounds, although not identical, but just slightly different at the end. The first word, "ongeemancipeerd," ends with "de," and the second word, "alumiseert," ends with "eut." Although the sounds are not identical, they are very similar, resulting in rhyming words.</s>
piepjongst, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end.

Dutch uses the VU-VU-V pattern for word-final consonant clusters. In the phrase "piepjongst," this pattern is followed: p-p-n-t. In the phrase "verlegd," it is followed as well: v-r-l-g-d. Thus, they sound identical, which causes the rhyme.</s>
constant, plant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "constant-plant" rhyme because they have different consonants (C and pl) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (e, c, a, n, t and pl, p, a, n).</s>
gekant, variant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekant" and "variant" rhyme because they have the same syllables and consonant sounds at the end. Although the word "variant" has an extra letter, its consonant and vowel sounds do not change, making it a perfect match for "gekant" to rhyme.</s>
beschietend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "beschietend" and "aanvijl," rhyme. They both end in the vowel "ı" combined with "n" and "m" sounds.</s>
negeert, tarifeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "negeert" and "tarifeert" do rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds (T, R, P) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (E). Rhyming words in the Dutch language are often those that share such common consonant sounds, so 'negeert' and 'tarifeert' are considered to rhyme according to the Dutch Language patterns.</s>
gepsalmodieerd, geobjectiveerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme since they have different consonants before the vowel 'a' that is common in both words:

- In the word "gepsalmodieerd," the consonant 'p' comes before the 'a.'
- In the word "geobjectiveerd," the consonant 'g' comes before the 'a.'

These two words do not have the same consonant sound sequence before the 'a' vowel, which would be required for them to rhyme.</s>
meridionaal, kruisbessestruik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

In this case, meridionaal and kruisbessestruik share the same vowel sounds at the end of the words (i and a), and they differ only in the specific consonants before the vowels. The similar endings make them rhyme.</s>
saboteer, structureer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme i.e. have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

Justification:
In English, we say that verbal phrases rhyme when the final consonants are the same and the final vowels are different to say them aloud. However, Dutch language has different rules and does not follow the English rhyme rules. This is why the two words you provided, 'saboteer' and 'structureer', do not rhyme. Although sharing identical final consonants, 're' in 'saboteer' and 'tr' in 'structureer', they do not have the following identical vowel and consonant sounds like the English word 'beat' and 'meet'. Dutch also has different phonetic and linguistic features compared to English. Therefore, even if the words have the same final consonant, they wouldn't be considered as rhyming in Dutch.</s>
vergaloppeert, gefalsificeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vergaloppeert" and "gefalsificeerd" do rhyme. Both words contain identical consonant sounds (gf at the beginning) followed by the same vowel sound (e), which is the third letter in both words.</s>
joysticks, rentetarieven, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "rentetarieven" do rhyme because both have the same final consonant and vowel sound (both end with 'e'). The consonants "j-st" and "n-tr" are different, but the 'e' in both words produces the same vowel sound and consonant sound, allowing them to rhyme.</s>
kwintalen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words can indeed rhyme, although they have different consonants and a slight change in the way the final consonant, "t", is pronounced. Both words end with the vowel sound /ɪst/. When you pronounce "kwintalen" /qwintəlen/ the "t" can be rolled over to /t/, and in "esthetica" it becomes /st/. It's not an exact match, but it is a close enough pair to rhyme for our purposes here. So, the answer is, "Yes, these Dutch words rhyme."</s>
vuilpersleiding, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vuilpersleiding-invallen" do rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
agiteert, gesubsidieerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "agiteert" and "gesubsidieerd" rhyme, because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
rotacisme, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rotacisme-esthetiek" rhyme, as they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (root-actionism-ethics). In this case, there is an "s" sound at the end of both words, which is the main distinctive feature. The other vowels and consonants are not relevant to rhyme.</s>
volant, acceptant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "volant" and "acceptant," rhyme because both words share the identical vowel and consonant sounds, even though there are different consonants in between. In this case, "volant" and "acceptant" share the consonant sounds 'o' and 'a,' which is a typical pattern of rhyme in many languages, including Dutch.</s>
kristalliseert, ongeclausuleerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kristalliseert" and "ongeclausuleerd" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. One word is spelled "kristalliseert" (rhyming with "clausuleerd") and the other word is spelled "ongeclausuleerd" (rhyming with "kunst").</s>
wegdropen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdropen" and "esthetica" rhyme. They share common endings "-pen" and "-etica" and both begin with the consonant sound /w/ followed by a diphthong (/aj/ and /ɛj/, respectively).</s>
negeert, gedesavoueerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "negeert" and "gedesavoueerd" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, "negeert" has the consonant pair "ge" and "eert" and "gedesavoueerd" has the consonant pair "ge" and "desavoueerd". The identical vowel and consonant sound is present in both words, resulting in a rhyme.</s>
chrysant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "chrysant-ontbrand," rhyme. The reason is that the words have similar consonant sounds at the beginning. In English, this pattern of similar consonant sounds is known as alliteration. Thus, while the words chrysant-ontbrand and flora-fusion will not rhyme with each other in the traditional sense, the word pair shares this special characteristic.</s>
toppenant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: In the words "toppenant" and "chrysant", the repeating pattern is "o-p-n-a-n-t" and "ch-r-s-a-n-t". The only variation is the addition of the "s" sound in "chrysant". The rest of the sounds are identical, with consonants followed by the same vowel (a), thus making them rhyme.</s>
saboteert, monoftongeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "saboteert" and "monoftongeert" do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. 

In both words, a consonant "b" (initial sound) is followed by a "o" vowel (same sound in both), and then by two consonants "eer" sounding the same in both of them. So, in rhyming terms, "saboteert" and "monoftongeert" are actually quite similar to the English word rhymes "dad" and "rad," which also share identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end.</s>
brandverzekering, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words brandverzekering-aanvijl rhyme as the last two syllables both end with the identical sound of "-lij." In this case, both words contain different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds as their endings.</s>
fazant, variant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fazant" and "variant" do rhyme, as they both have different consonants (f and v) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (anz).</s>
gekant, mant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have a -ant rhyme scheme. The consonants (k, m) in both words are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (e in gek and a in mant), which is a common feature in Dutch.</s>
attentie, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie" and "bekwaamden" rhyme as they both have the same sound patterns for the consonants "t," "n," and "k" followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The vowel "e" is also present in both words, which contributes further to the rhyme. 

In Dutch phonetic structure, when a vowel matches in both words and a consonant comes after the same consonant, it makes them rhyme. The distinction of the consonants "t" and "k" does not significantly impact the rhyme pattern in this context.</s>
voorlig, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "voorlig-statica" do not rhyme, as the only identical consonant and vowel sound is the "s" sound at the end of both words.</s>
geitalianiseerd, geparenteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme as they have different syllables and unrelated consonant-vowel-consonant patterns. The first word "geitalianiseerd" has the pattern "g-ait-ah-liy-ah-niz-er-d" while the second word "geparenteerd" has the pattern "g-ap-ar-en-teer-d." Despite having similar vowel sounds in "ait" and "ah," the rest of the words do not match in consonant-vowel-consonant patterns.</s>
gekant, rekestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekant" and "rekestrant" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds (k and r) followed by identical vowel sounds (a). Both pairs of consonants and vowels produce the same sound in each word, resulting in a rhyme.</s>
passeer, solemniseer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "passeer" and "solemniseer" do rhyme. They have the same vowel sound ("i"), but different consonant sounds. The first word ends with "r" while the second word ends with "r" and "z." Both endings are pronounced as a devoiced velar fricative. Therefore, the two words have identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhymes in the language.</s>
geblancheerd, consacreert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both these Dutch words, "geblancheerd" and "consacreert," rhyme, despite having a few differences in their individual vocabulary. The differences of the letters and sounds can be represented as follows: 

- i: [ee]
- n: [ɛn]
- e: [ee]
- r: [ɛr]
- s: [es]
- t: [ɛt]

In the case of "geblancheerd," the letters blunt the vowel sound [e:] to an [ee], while in "consacreert," the consonant 't' has the sound of a softened 'd'. However, the main vowels are identical and the consonant sounds in both words are comparable, therefore enabling them to rhyme.</s>
tensie, veranderingsmogelijkheden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
saboteer, pelletiseer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "saboteer" and "pelletiseer," do rhyme. Although they have a different first letter, they both have identical consonant sounds at the end: /ɛr/ for "eteer" (the Dutch pronunciation for "aboteer") and /ɛz/ for "letiser" (the Dutch pronunciation for "petaliser"). The consonant-vowel-consonant pattern is maintained in each word.</s>
welbedachte, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "welbedachte" (thoughtfully considered) and "jut" (grunt, whinny) do not have the same sound patterns in their consonant and vowel sounds.

Justification:
The Dutch language, like many other languages, may have unique phonetic structures or exceptions that do not strictly adhere to rhyme rules found in other languages. "Welbedachte" and "jut" do, however, exhibit some structural similarity in terms of consonant and vowel sounds, as "dekte" and "sputte", respectively.

Nevertheless, it's essential to note that they do not form a regular rhyming pattern since the endings (e-te and ut-te) are different in terms of their phonetic structures.</s>
kielvlak, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words kielvlak-navoelen do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
desorganiseert, amplificeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end, except for the difference in the consonants. However, it should be noted that because the words have different numbers of consonants on the end (desorganiseert has two consonants, while amplificeert has none), they are not technically "strict" rhymes in the sense one might think of in terms of classic poetry, where the consonants are identical.</s>
gerebelleerd, gedemagnetiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "gerebelleerd" and "gedemagnetiseerd", indeed rhyme as they both have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme is established by the sequence of consonants 'g' - 'd' in both words, followed by the same vowels 'e' and 'o'.</s>
verlichtten, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They have different consonants (C, L, R, T, and M) between the words, followed by identical sounds in the second part of the words (V-O-N which is similar). The words aren't in a rhyming pattern.</s>
palissadeert, monoftongeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, Dutch words "palissadeert-monoftongeert" do rhyme, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between them is the presence of "t" sound, which is common in many Dutch words. The consonant clusters do not create a rhyme. Therefore, it can be considered a coincidental rhyme.</s>
kruisbessestruik, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme since they contain different consonants in the first syllable (kruis- and vo-), followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable.</s>
gekalibreerd, gecollabeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words gekalibreerd-gecollabeerd do not rhyme.

Justification:
- "gekalibreerd" ends with the consonant sounds "fr" and "rd",
- "gecollabeerd" ends with the consonant sounds "fr" and "bd"
- the vowels in both words also don't match for rhyme. "e-e" in the first word is not "e-e" in the second word
Therefore, the two words don't rhyme with each other based on the vowel and consonant sound structure.

Therefore, these Dutch words do not rhyme.</s>
zenuwpijn, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme in the sense that their end sounds are identical for the most part.

zenuwpijn and treknet are both Dutch nouns, and they both end with the identical sound vowel "i," making them a phonetic rhyme. However, they do not perfectly rhyme because the first part (words before the final vowel) are different. While treknet starts with a consonant + vowel ("tr + ee"), zenuwpijn starts with an "s" + vowel ("z + eu"). The identical sound "i" in both words makes them an example of an onset vowel rhyme. The words indeed share a significant sound, but their initial sound differences result in a less-than-perfect rhyme.</s>
piepjongst, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "versmallen" rhyme because they share the consonant sounds 'pp' in "piep" and "jong" and 'sm' in "smallen" and "allen", as well as the identical vowel sound of 'a' at the end of both words.</s>
presseert, consacreert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "presseert" and "consacreert," do indeed rhyme. They both have differing consonant sounds that are followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words have "ss" as the consonant sound that precedes the vowel "ee" - "pres" in "presseert" and "cons" in "consacreert." Moreover, the vowel "a" in both words results in the same consonant sound - "cr" in both words. Overall, despite the differing consonants, the identical vowel and consonant sounds in these words give them a rhyme in this context.</s>
mandateert, substantiveert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words. The only difference is the presence of different consonants between the two words, which does not affect their rhyming sound.</s>
beschietend, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words rhyme because they have the same consonant pattern followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the change in the consonant sounds, but the consonants they have in common still generate a rhyme. The word "vuilpersleiding" can be broken down into "vuil", "persleiding", "beschietend", and "vuilpersleiding". The similarity of sounds between "vuilpersleiding" and "beschietend" demonstrates they rhyme.</s>
afgrijzenwekkendere, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "afgrijzenwekkendere" and "ontruimt" do rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds. This is due to the endings "-der" and "-t", which both belong to the "e" group, and the similar vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end of both words (the "wek" and "r" in "wekkendere" versus the "r" at the end of "ontruimt").</s>
tensie, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "bekwaamden" rhyme. Both words share the following structure:

- Initial consonant ('t' or 'b')
- Identical vowel sound (e in both words)
- Identical consonant sound (same at the end)

Thus, these two words have the same pattern of vowels and consonants, resulting in a rhyming sound.</s>
ontduik, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontduik-registratierechten" both rhyme. They have different consonants at the beginning (ont-reg), followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds of -e and -r.</s>
taswoning, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gemeste, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gemeste" and "ontroomt" do rhyme as they share the same consonant and vowel sounds, although different consonants are used before them. Both words end with the same sequence of consonants (m-t) and vowel (e) sound.</s>
platteband, rekestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "platteband" and "rekestrant" do rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds, although the consonant sounds are different. Here is a table showing the consonant sounds in each word:

| Word  | Platteband | Rekestrant |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| Consonant | p, l, t | r, k, s |
| Vowel  | a   | e, r  |

The consonants at the end of the words, "p, l, t" and "r, k, s", have the same sounds.</s>
tensie, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tensie" and "bedienaars" in Dutch do rhyme because they both follow the pattern of having different consonant sounds followed by identical consonant and vowel sounds. The only difference is the consonant sound ("s" vs "r"), but the vowel sound remains the same, and the rhyme is maintained effectively.</s>
planimetreer, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words do rhyme as they have the same consonant sounds at the beginning (p and in) and identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end (m and l).</s>
vergaloppeert, gefosforesceerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vergaloppeert" and "gefosforesceerd" rhyme. They have different consonants ("r" and "fr") but identical vowel and consonant sounds ("o", "o", and "o", respectively).</s>
kruisbessestruik, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

In this case, "kruisbessestruik" and "indeuk" do not rhyme. This is due to the fact that "kruisbessestruik" consists of vowel and consonant sounds (/kruːz.bɛs.sɛ.struːx/) while "indeuk" consists of (/ɪn.də.uːk/). The difference in the final syllables "struik" vs "indeuk" with different vowel sounds make the words non-rhyming. It is important to note that word to word rhyming in languages can be nuanced, and not all words that contain the same vowel or consonant sounds are necessarily considered rhyming.</s>
geinfereerd, gemineerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
deposant, overspant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deposant" and "overspant" rhyme. Both words have different consonants ("de" and "ov"), followed by identical consonant sounds, and then identical vowel and consonant sounds ("ep" and "sp"). Therefore, they rhyme.</s>
voorlegt, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They both end in the same consonant sound, "-icon," and have different consonants followed by identical vowel sounds, "l-" and "r-".</s>
plantluis, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "plantluis-voorlieg" contain a common pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of each word, which makes them rhyme words.</s>
geneert, geciseleerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geneert" and "geciseleerd" do rhyme. Both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme is "neet" and "seet," respectively.</s>
tabuleert, geparenteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "tabuleert" and "geparenteerd" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme. These words both have a -ta-rhyme, where the vowel sound is the same (e) and the consonant sounds on the next letter are different (t vs d).</s>
psychoanalytici, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici" and "vooreinde" do indeed rhyme, as they contain identical consonant sounds followed by the same vowel sound ("oi").</s>
bacchant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bacchant" and "chrysant" rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds in their final parts. The same analysis can be applied to many other Dutch words.</s>
joysticks, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The word "Joysticks" is a noun, while "Vadervreugde" is a Dutch term for "Father's joy." The only difference between the two words is the presence of vowels as per the Dutch language phonology rules, which allows for the end of a word to sound identical to another word with a simple change. The word "Vader" ("Father") and "vreugde" ("joy") both contain identical consonant sounds but different vowels, which creates the rhyme between "Joysticks-Vadervreugde."</s>
ontruimt, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt-esthetiek" contain a rhyme element as they have the same two consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
triomfant, bestand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "triomfant" and "bestand" rhyme when considering the identical vowel and consonant sounds after the consonants. Here's the word combination broken down:

triomfant: tr i o m f a n t
bestand: b e s t a n d

In each word, after the consonants (tr, br), the vowels, followed by the second consonant (i, b), sound the same. Therefore, these Dutch words rhyme.</s>
voorlig, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "voorlig-esthetica" does rhyme, as both words have identical consonant sounds (l is silent in the first word) followed by identical vowel sounds.</s>
mant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "mant-chrysant" do rhyme. In this case, the consonants "m", "n", "-", "c", "h", "r", "s", and "t" combined with the identical vowel sound make the words rhyme. The absence of a consonant in a rhyme may occur in some instances as well. In the phrase "mant-chrysant," the consonants "n", "c", "r", "s", and "t" all line up correctly with the identical vowel sound, making it a valid example of rhyme.</s>
individualiseert, monoftongeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words not rhyme.

Here is a breakdown of the words and analysis:

1. "Individualiseert" - This word is spelled phonetically (with correct pronunciation) which helps us understand the vowel and consonant sounds.
 - "in" - /ɪn/
 - "di-va-lee-shunz" - /dɪ.və.li.ʃuːn/
 - "er" - /ɜr/

2. "Monoftongeert" - Again, spelling the words provides clues on how to pronounce these words.
 - "mon-o-fon-teg-eert" - /mə.nɝf.ɒn.teg.eət/

You can hear the difference by trying to pronounce these two words. They do not rhyme because the vowels ("e" in "in" and "er" and "o" in "fon-teg-eert") do have the identical consonant sound, but the position and the other consonant sounds in the words themselves are different.</s>
trompetboom, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have identical vowel sounds at the end of the words (b in "boom" and p in "trompet"). They also have the same consonant sound before the vowel (m in both "boom" and "trompet"). Even though the vowels at the end of each word are different (o in "boom" and i in "overlig"), they still rhyme due to the repetition of the identical vowel sounds.</s>
gedisponeerd, gecarboniseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gedisponeerd" and "gecarboniseerd" rhyme. They have the identical final vowel and consonant sounds 'e' and 's', respectively, which are followed by different consonants.</s>
variant, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "variant-bacchant" do rhyme as they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
meridionaal, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words you provided, "meridionaal-bedrijving", rhyme. They have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, which is what typically indicates a rhyme in the English language. In this case, the pattern is like this:

- Both words end with "o" sounding consonant.
- Then both end with a repeating "i" sounding vowel.

So, they "rhyme" because they have the same basic structure at the end which can create a feeling of similarity and agreement in tone. 

But, please be mind that these words rhymes are more like phonetic-like rhymes because they share the same underlying sounds that are stressed on the same consonant and vowel, but, for those not versed in linguistics or phonetics may not hear it as a full rhyme.</s>
pikantst, abundantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pikantst" and "abundantst" rhyme. Both words have the same vowel sound (ee) and the same consonant sound (sh) at the end, which creates the rhyme. The rhyme is between the two consonant clusters "pik" and "abundantst."</s>
hydrateert, amplificeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In the words "hydrateert" and "amplificeert," the identical vowel sound and consonant sounds - "ert" - in the end cause them to rhyme.</s>
kielvlak, trompetbomen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "kielvlak" and "trompetbomen" have the same vowel sound (i.e., -o- in both), but the consonants are different. The first word ends with "-k" and the second one ends with "-p-m-n." Despite the differences in consonants, the combination of vowels in these two words create similar sonorous sequences, making them rhyme.</s>
jatte, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatte" and "voorlegt" do rhyme. They have a similar structure: each word starts with a consonant ("j" and "v"), and they both have the same vowel and consonant sound ("at" and "or" in "jatte" and "oor" in "voorlegt").</s>
triomfant, sympathisant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme as they both have the same consonant sounds at the end - "triomfant" and "sympathisant." The difference in the consonants lies at the beginning, but this pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end results in a rhyme.</s>
jut, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-taswoning" appear to rhyme with each other. Let's break down the rhyming pattern:

- "jut" and "tas" are both three-letter words which follow the general Dutch rhyming pattern of having two identical consonant sounds before a vowel.
- The final syllable, "woning" is a single word that still follows the typical Dutch rhyming pattern.

In conclusion, "jut-taswoning" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds which makes them rhyme.</s>
debitant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No. The given Dutch words debitant and chrysant do not rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds: debitant and chrysant . The only identical element between them is the length of the vowel sounds, as the Dutch words debitant and chrysant have an unstressed long vowel sound in them.</s>
binnenstormde, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "binnestormde-voorlegt" rhyme, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds after different consonants.</s>
trompetboom, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonants (trompet and navoelen) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/pɔmɑələn/). 

Here are the syllables in both words:

1. trompetboom:
- trompe
- ^boom

Same vowel and consonant ending in the end, -mb.

2. navoelen:
- navoelen

Same vowel and consonant ending in the end, -loen.

Different consonants at the start, but identical vowel and consonant endings, justifying their rhyming nature.</s>
psychoanalytici, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

`Psychoanalytici-jut` is an example of a perfect rhyme in Dutch, which involves the consonant sounds 'chi' and 'jut' being identical when followed by the same vowel sounds 'si' and 'ut'. The two words sound similar and share the same rhyme pattern, making them a perfect example of rhyming words in Dutch.</s>
fondant, variant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fondant" and "variant" do rhyme because they both end with the same consonant and vowel sounds: "f-a-n-t" and "v-a-r-i-a-n-t".</s>
convenant, plant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "convenant" and "plant" rhyme. This is because "convenant" is more commonly used in the English language and "plant" is the correct spelling in the Dutch language. So, in terms of the sounds that the words make, they do rhyme.</s>
bestand, overspant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bestand-overspant" rhyme. 

Rhyme can be defined as the repetition of vowel and consonant sounds, usually with at least one set of the same consonant sounds. In this example, the words "bestand" and "overspant" both follow this pattern, where the consonant "st" in "bestand" and the consonant "s" in "overspant" both have a similar 'stopping' sound following another consonant. The vowels 'n' and 't' are similar in sound, making the words rhyme with each other.

This is one of the possible scenarios for Dutch rhyme, and many Dutch words exhibit this kind of rhyme pattern.</s>
meridionaal, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

In both words, "meridionaal" and "schreeuweriger", the last syllables have identical vowel sounds and consonant sounds (the r). In the first word, the consonants are "e" and "o", while in the second word, they are "i" and "r". These sound sequences are different but follow the same pattern, resulting in rhyme.</s>
bestand, variant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
confirmeert, geoculeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The consonant sounds in "confirmeert" and "geoculeerd" are different. In fact, they are assonance, not rhyme, where identical consonant sounds are shared but other consonant sounds are different. In this case, "confirmeert" ends with a /ʁ/ and "geoculeerd" ends with a /θ/. Both have the same vowel sounds and consonant sounds but different consonant sounds leading to the words not rhyming.</s>
toppenant, rekestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toppenant" and "rekestrant" do rhyme because they share a pattern of similar consonant and vowel sounds at the end of the words. Although the actual words may be misspelled in the given example, the root of these words still follows the rhyme pattern of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme.</s>
polymerie, antropologie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "polymerie" and "antropologie," have different consonant sounds in the first part, but they both rhyme as they both end with the vowel "oe" followed by the same consonant "l." The vowel sound remains the same while the consonant sound changes from "m" to "p," but both words still maintain a similar rhyming pattern.</s>
planimetreer, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "planimetreer" and "ingestorte" rhyme according to the rules of Dutch phonetics. They both have different consonants (M for planimetreer and R for ingestorte) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (-EER for both words).</s>
trompetboom, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompetboom" and "radende" rhyme. 

This is because 'trompet' (trumpet) and 'radende' (giving happiness or joy) have the same sounding vowels and a similar pattern of consonants. In Dutch, words can share the same rhyme regardless of the change in vowel pronunciation.</s>
meridionaal, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words 'meridionaal' and 'versvoeten' do rhyme. This is because there are similar vowel and consonant sounds at the end: 'meridionaal-versvoeten' rhymes with 'merchant-pants', where the final consonants are the same - 'nt' in both cases.</s>
piketteert, gefosforesceerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piketteert" (a refining process) and "gefosforesceerd" (plural of "fosforescent," which refers to the chemical that emits a florescent glow) rhyme in terms of alliteration and consonance. Both words follow the pattern of 'pi-' consonants before the same vowel sound and -eerd consonants. However, to be precise, "gefosforesceerd" may sound slightly different because of the 'eert' sound, but the overall rhyme still holds true.</s>
convenant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "convenant-chrysant" are Dutch words that rhyme. Both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The consonants in both words are c-h-s-t, and the vowels remain the same.</s>
riskantst, briljantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In these cases, "st" at the end of each word is the main sound that remains consistent after the consonant changes ("riskant" and "briljant").</s>
voorlieg, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlieg-naduiken" rhyme because they have similar consonant and vowel patterns:

- "v" and "n" are the only consonants that are different, but this doesn't affect the overall vowel sound since both words end in a "-ij-" sound.

- The main similarity in the words lies with the vowel sounds: both words contain the same "i" sound and the same "u" sound.</s>
veenderij, slavernij, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds at the end and different consonants in between. The first syllable "veenderij" has the consonant sounds /v/ and /n/ while the second syllable "slavernij" has the consonant sounds /s/ and /l/. Both ends of the words are pronounced with the same vowel sound, making the rhyme.</s>
bedrijving, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds. 

In the first word "bedrijving" (company), the consonant sounds (bl) do not match the ones in "invul" (fill up). Hence, they do not rhyme. Rhymes occur when words have the same ending sounds, even if they have slightly different sequences of consonants.</s>
overspant, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "overspant" and "bacchant" do rhyme.

Although overspant and bacchant share different consonant sounds in the end of each word -- both ending with a consonant "s" and "t" sound, respectively -- they maintain the identical vowel sounds in between. Specifically, the word "overspant" rhymes with the final syllable, "spant", while the word "bacchant" rhymes with the final syllable, "cchant". Both endings follow the same phonetic pattern of an identical vowel sound paired with a consonant, followed by the same consonant sound. This demonstrates that they rhyme despite having different consonants and no vowel sound difference.</s>
biometrie, acrobatie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "biometrie-acrobatie" do not rhyme because the two words have different consonants (b-i, m-o, r-e). The only repeated sounds are the identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words ("tri" and "tie"), but this does not establish a rhyme.</s>
satansboleten, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the provided Dutch words "satansboleten-esthetica" do not rhyme. The reason for this is that the first word, "satansboleten," ends with the consonant "t," which stops any vowel from rolling or changing into its corresponding vowel sound in the second word, "esthetica." As a result, when one of the final consonants of the first word is pronounced, it prevents the vowels from linking and creates a clear phonetic difference between the two words.</s>
duif, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "duif" and "bagatellen" end with the same vowel and consonant sounds - /v/ and /tɛlən/. This is an example of iambic syllablization, where both words have two syllables with the same stress pattern and consonant sounds.</s>
fazant, mant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fazant" and "mant" do rhyme (or sound alike) because they both match the pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the different consonants (sh in "fazant" and ng in "mant") followed by the same vowel (a in "fazant" and a in "mant") create a harmonious rhyme.</s>
overspant, convenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "overspant" and "convenant" could be considered as rhyming words since they share a similar vowel sound and the sequence of consonants is almost the same. 

Justification:
In English, we have an understanding of rhyme through a comparison of the last four or five letters in a set of words. Words that match on similar consonants with identical vowel sounds can still be considered similar in terms of English poetic principles.

However, it's essential to note that Dutch language follows its unique linguistic patterns, particularly when it comes to consonant clusters. As such, the traditional English method of defining rhyme may not necessarily hold true for some words in the Dutch linguistic spectrum.</s>
kerkerende, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
mant, gebrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "mant-gebrand" rhyme, as they have identical consonant and vowel sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds are "m," "n," "t," and "g," and the vowels are "a," "r," and "e." The "n" in "mant" and the "r" in "gebrand" also match.</s>
platteband, plant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "platteband" and "plant" rhyme with each other, as they have the same ending consonant sounds and differ in their first vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both the words end with the consonant sound "nt," which makes them rhyme.</s>
gepivoteerd, seksualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words gepivoteerd-seksualiseert are an example of a rhyming pair. 

They rhyme because the vowels (e in both words) and the final consonant (t/d in the first word and d/r in the second word) sound identical. In rhyming, it's essential that the consonant sounds correspond to one another within both words. Here, 'ge' in the first word and 'ge' in the second are the significant contributors to their rhyme. 

So, while the words may grammatically be different in structure, they meet the criteria for a rhyme since they share those identical consonants and vowel sounds.</s>
geblancheerd, musiceert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geblancheerd-musiceert" rhyme. They both have the same final consonant sound and identical vowel. This is a case of near-rhyme, as the only difference is the consonant sound before the final identical vowel. So, even though the words are not identically spelled, they still share many of the same sound patterns.</s>
taswoning, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel-consonant sounds. 

In this context, "taswoning" has the ending "-ing," and "bagatellen" has the ending "-en." The vowel sounds (e and o) and the consonant sounds (n and s) in both words remain the same, which results in vocal rhyme.</s>
hotsikidee, communique, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hotsikidee" and "communique" rhyme. Both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds - [hɔs̠iˈkiːdiː] and [kəmˈnuːniː] respectively.</s>
geneert, geparenteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "geneert" and "geparenteerd," do rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds even though they have different consonants at the beginning.</s>
bombardeurs, modelleurs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bombardeurs" and "modelleurs" do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds. Although the letters are different, the pronunciation matches. Rhyming words are often used in poems and songs, and in Dutch, rhyming is an important aspect of poetry and songwriting.</s>
gecreosoteerd, monoftongeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "gecreosoteerd" and "monoftongeert" rhyme. They have a similar structure with different consonants and identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In both words:
1. the "c" sound is changed to a "k" sound
2. both words have a "j" sound for the "g" sound and its onset.
3. both words have a "r" sound in the end.

The rhyming structure in both words is "c - r - t - p - s - e - r - t - j - t - e - r".</s>
confirmeert, conglutineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided, "confirmeert" and "conglutineert", do rhyme to some extent. Both words have similar word endings with two unstressed vowels "e" and "e". The consonants in both words, "f" and "g", are followed by identical consonant sounds, which allows for a partial rhyme. In Dutch, rhyme is often achieved by similar word endings and consonants, especially in the last syllable or two. However, pronunciation and stress differences can sometimes contribute to a higher degree of rhyme.</s>
kandideer, laiciseer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kandideer" and "laiciseer" do rhyme, as they share an identical pattern of consonant sounds followed by vowel sounds. 

'kandideer' consists of: 
 k (voiced alveolar plosive)
 änder (long a in English)
 d (voiced alveolar affricate)
 ij (short i in English)
 eer (long a in English)
Total two vowels and four consonants, patterning is kander ijeer.

'laiciseer' consists of: 
 l (voiced labiodental fricative)
 äç (long a in English)
 iç (short i in English)
 eer (long a in English)
Total two vowels and four consonants, patterning is läç ijeer.

Both of these strings follow the same sounds, with the difference of having a "v" in 'kander' and "a" in 'läç' (or long a in Dutch), they maintain the identical pattern of identical consonants followed by identical vowel sounds. That's why they rhyme.</s>
gefosforesceerd, gekwadreerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "gefasooideerd" and "gekwadreerd" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme.</s>
geblancheerd, gesubsidieerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "geblancheerd" (meaning "bleached") and "gesubsidieerd" (meaning "subsidized") do rhyme. This is because, despite having different consonants in their beginnings, they both end with the same consonant sounds (aer in both cases). The presence of an identical vowel sound (/i/) in both words also contributes to their rhyme.</s>
hypertrofie, exogamie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
rekestrant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because the different consonants (r and s) are followed by identical vowel (e) and consonant (n) sounds (strant and chrysant).</s>
Jut, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-ingestort" do rhyme. They have different consonants (J-t) but identical vowel sounds (both ending with "a") and consonant sounds (the final "t" in each word).</s>
belichtingstechnicus, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "belichtingstechnicus" and "trompetboom" do rhyme. They share the same consonant sound (t) and the same vowel sound (o) at the end.</s>
geobjectiveerd, gedemagnetiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geobjectiveerd" and "gedemagnetiseerd" do rhyme, as they have identical consonant sounds following the vowel 'e'. Both words have 'c' and 'm' after the 'e', which is followed by the same consonant sound in both words.</s>
verdijt, hydrauliciteit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verdijt" and "hydrauliciteit" do rhyme as they have the same consonant sounds at the beginning and end of the words. The only difference is that the word "verdijt" ends with the consonant 'j' while "hydrauliciteit" ends with the consonant 'y'. The vowel sound "oe" in "verdijt" and "hydrauliciteit" contributes to the rhyme.</s>
duivelsklauwen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duivelsklauwen" and "voorlig" do rhyme. Both words end with the same vowel sound (i.e., -lig), and only the final consonant is different (i.e., "k" and "l" in "duivelsklauwen" and "v" in "voorlig"). This difference in final consonants creates the rhyme, as opposed to identical consonant sounds. However, it is worth noting that the presence of the word "k" in the first word increases the similarity between the sounds.</s>
troposfeer, pelletiseer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

Here's why:
- 'troposfeer' has a Dutch spelling and pronunciation, and its ending 'sfeer' follows the Dutch phonetic pattern for that suffix meaning 'atmosphere'. It doesn't have identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end like 'pelletiseer'. 
- 'pelletiseer' spelled without diacritics is 'pelletisieren' in German, 'pélétiser' in French (with the 'e' changed to 'é' due to French double vowel rules) and 'pelastisera' in Finnish (which, however, is not a Dutch word as it's Finnish) 
and is 'pulletiser' in Dutch 
- Although, in Finnish or German it may have a similar sounding rhyme. 
 
So in Dutch it will sound /ˈpɛləstɪseːr/.</s>
treknet, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They have different consonant sounds, specifically "t" and "r" in the first word, and "d" and "m" in the second word. Additionally, they have different vowel sounds, with "e" in the first word and "a" in the other.</s>
zenuwpijn, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They do not have the same vowel sounds or consonant sounds. The first word, zenuwpijn (neck pain) starts with 'n' and 'z', followed by 'eu' (euphemism for 'you'). In the second word, zouterijen (salt factory), the first sound is 't' and 'z', followed by the vowel 'o' and 'y', which is a different vowel sound. Thus, these two words do not rhyme.</s>
gekalibreerd, mediatiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme.

The words "gekalibreerd" and "mediatiseert" have the following phonetic pattern in common:
- Both words start with the same consonant ("g"): gekalibreerd-mediatiseert
- Both words have the same vowel sound at the end: "rd" - "tiseert"
- Both words have the same consonant pattern.

So, they rhyme because they share the same pattern of sounds.</s>
onderligger, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "onderligger-aanvijl" do rhyme. The words have a "delegeren"/"invaderen" sequence (with voiced and voiceless pairs at the start) that forms a pattern in Dutch language.</s>
piepjongst, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "piepjongst" and "gemeste" can be considered to rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
tensie, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "navoelen" both have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. Although the word endings are different - "ie" and "van", the consonants at the beginning match in both the words.</s>
hartzwakte, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have the same consonant sound in both words but different vowel sounds. Specifically, the rhyme occurs between the "z" in "hartzwakte" and "l" in "voorlig".</s>
constant, gebrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words constant-gebrand do not rhyme. 

In the language of classical Dutch (from before 19th century), the only exceptions were the words constant-gebrand and bodem-bedrijf, which retained older orthographical usage with double consonants and an unvocalized 'm' at the end. However, the new spelling reform in 19th century eliminated double consonants except in exceptional cases, so new double consonants started forming in the language.</s>
gecontamineerd, musiceert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gecontamineerd" and "musiceert" rhyme because the final consonant sounds are the same ([r] and [r]). However, the beginning vowel sounds are different ([ɛ] and [u]), making them unstressed vowels. So, while the ending consonant sounds are the same, the initial stressed vowel sounds are different, making the words not completely homophonous.</s>
hartzwakte, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hartzwakte" and "vuilpersleiding" do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, although with different consonants. The vowels are the same, but the consonants are altered.</s>
conglutineert, toupeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "conglutineert" and "toupeert" do rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds. The first vowels, "o" and "e," do not match between the words, but the consonants and sounds after those points are the same.</s>
pirouetteert, seksualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the two Dutch words you mentioned "pirouetteert-seksualiseert" do not rhyme. They have different consonant sounds and do not follow the rules of rhyme. "Pirouetteert" ends with 'r', while "seksualiseert" ends with 'r'. The similar vowel sound in "er" at the end of each word is not the cause of rhyme. 

Phonetically, "pirouetteert" and "seksualiseert" create distinct and distinctive consonant sequences: 

- "pirouetteert" consists of "pirouetteert" with an "er" sequence at the end.
- "pirouetteert" consists of "seksualiseert" with "seksualiseert" having "seksualiseert" with an "eer" sequence at the end.

Due to these pronunciation differences, they do not rhyme as far as Dutch language rules are concerned.</s>
gebrand, sympathisant, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words gebrand-sympathisant do not rhyme. They do not have identical vowels and consonant sounds at the end, as required for rhyme. The end consonants in each word are "b" and "p", respectively, which are different, and the vowel sound that each word ends with is quite distinct. This makes the words independent and not capable of rhyming.</s>
distantieert, nielleert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes 

The words "distantieert" and "nielleert" rhyme because they have the same number of syllables, and they both end in the same consonant with the same vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the difference in the final consonant sound (distant vs. niel). However, this is sufficient to make them rhyme because they maintain the identical vowel and consonant sounds at different points in each word.</s>
piketteer, charmeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piketteer" and "charmeer" rhyme as they share identical vowel sounds (e in "piketteer" and "charmeer"). However, the consonant sounds differ between the two words (p in "piketteer" and ch in "charmeer").</s>
geamortiseerd, gemineerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geamortiseerd" and "gemineerd" do rhyme. They have the same consonant sounds ("ee" and "mm") followed by the identical vowel sound (both end in the vowel "e"). These words are examples of a "consonantal rhyme" where the consonant sounds are the same but the vowel sounds differ.</s>
rekwestrant, bestand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
treknet, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The given words, "treknet-tachisme," have different consonants at the beginning, which results in a completely different sound for the words. Therefore, they do not rhyme.</s>
loopgravenstelling, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loopgravenstelling" and "indeuk" indeed rhyme, as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds. Both words begin with the same initial consonant, 'l,' followed by the same vowel sound, 'oi' in 'loopgravenstelling,' and 'u' in 'indeuk.' 

In Dutch, consonant sounds are the same in both words, with 'g' and 'n' being the minor differences, but because these consonants are pronounced the same regardless of being in a final position, the phonetic patterns in the words match, giving rise to rhyme.</s>
gedesavoueerd, geopponeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gedesavoueerd" and "geopponeerd" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme is created by the final consonant 'd' in both words and the common vowel sound at the end. This is a classic example of a "rounded vowel" in both words, which are similar in pronunciation.</s>
gecreosoteerd, jubileert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme as they differ in consonant sounds. 

Gecreosoteerd (ge-krem-oso-tay-retd) has the following consonant/vowel pattern: gk - rm - s - s - t

Jubileert (yoo-bye-letr) has the following consonant/vowel pattern: yj - b - ly - tr

In these words, the only part that might seem similar is the ending vowel -ert, but that is just a homophone (a word pronounced similarly but having a different meaning). The actual sound patterns of the other consonants are different, and therefore rhyming isn't the case.</s>
presseert, gedemagnetiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'presseert' and 'gedemagnetiseerd' rhyme, as they share the ending vowel sound and have different consonant sounds before it, which is a typical pattern in Dutch rhyming words.</s>
verlichtten, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both of these Dutch words "verlichten" and "aanvijl" exhibit a "short-long" rhyme pattern - a common pattern in Dutch poetry. Essentially, the consonant sounds are different in the two words (V in "verlichten" and L in "aanvijl") but the following identical vowel and consonant (E in both words) sounds the same, thus resulting in a rhyme. Note that Dutch words may not always sound identical, but in this particular case, both words share the same vowel sound after a different consonant, which makes them rhyme.</s>
bacchant, plant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bacchant" and "plant" rhyme in the traditional Dutch language because they share the same consonant sounds with identical vowels.</s>
loopgravenstelling, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words indeed rhyme as they have identical consonants at the end, followed by the same sequence of consonant and vowel sounds. The only difference is the difference in the first syllable, 'loopgravenstelling-tensie,' which has a different vowel sound.</s>
plombeert, geopponeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plombeert" and "geopponeerd" do rhyme. Rhyming is defined as having identical consonant sounds followed by the same vowel sound. In this case, the consonant sounds are "pl-" and "n-", and the vowel sound is "t".</s>
vergaloppeert, gedemagnetiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vergaloppeert" and "gedemagnetiseerd" do rhyme. They share the same vowel sound (ee-uh) followed by "r" and have different consonant sounds at the beginning. This type of rhyme is known as "rime simple."</s>
lawinegevaar, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "lawinegevaar" (avalanche danger) and "ontduik" (swim in) do rhyme. They both have the same vowel sound "ou" (/u:/), followed by a consonant sound. Although the initial consonant is different ("law" vs. "ont"), they continue with identical consonant sounds ("e" and "t").</s>
toppenant, extravagant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "toppenant" and "extravagant" do rhyme because both words have consonant clusters followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds at the end. The word "toppenant" has "P" and "N" consonants at the end, while "extravagant" has "G" and "NT" consonants. The vowel sound in both words is "A" (or "O" for "toppenant"), making the rhyme.</s>
gebrand, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gebrande-chrysant" do rhyme. The rhyme schema in this case corresponds to the pattern "a" in rhyme terms. 

A more descriptive breakdown could be:

Gebrande-chrysant:

- gebrand (brand): /ɡe.brɑnt/
- chrysant (chrysanthemum): /ˈkʰʁɪz.ant(ə)/

Both words have their vowels (e and a) sounded the same, but end with different consonants: /ɡe.brɑnt(ər)ʃɑ.ntə/ and /ˈkʰʁɪz.ant(ə)məm/, respectively. Thus, these words rhyme, which is why we say they follow the pattern "a."</s>
gecarboniseerd, pirouetteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gecarboniseerd-pirouetteert" rhyme. They have different consonants (C and P) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (ae and er respectively). The rhyme scheme remains the same between the two words, making them rhyming words.</s>
zenuwpijn, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

The justification for this answer is based on the specific pronunciation and spelling patterns of each word in the phrase. 

"Zenuwpijn" (spelled as a common Dutch compound word consisting of "zenuw" meaning nerve and "pijn" meaning pain) ends with the consonant sound /n/, whereas "ordende" (a common Dutch word meaning order or arrangement) begins with a silent letter "o".

If we were to speak the words, we'd notice that the final 'n' in "zenuw" doesn't match the beginning 'o' in "ordende".

So, notwithstanding their common vowel sound /ɛn/, the consonant sounds are different. These differences in sound are typical of a non-rhyming relationship. Put another way, two words do not rhyme if their consonant sounds differ, even if they share a common vowel sound.</s>
hydroplaan, kleptomaan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have the same consonant/vowel pattern at the end. In English, we might say "hay doe plaan" and "keptome doe mone," which sound more English-like. So, both words share an identical consonant/vowel pattern even though the words are Dutch.</s>
piepjongst, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
nadook, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. 

These Dutch words "nadook-tachisme" do not rhyme. The words are made up of different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only similar consonants between the two words are "n" and "c," and the same applies to the vowels, with "a" being the only shared vowel in "t" position. Therefore, the words do not match in rhyme structure.</s>
tensie, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because both of them have identical vowel and consonant sounds: 

tensie - brandverzekering 

Here is a breakdown of the words: 

tensie - the word has a similar structure and sound pattern. It is composed of a different initial tone, which creates a brief pause before the vowel sound 'e'. The other sounds are all consistent, with the 'ensie' group of consonants and the 'brand' vowels. 

brandverzekering - It also has a consistent vowel and consonant pattern. The 'nd' consonant group in the middle, followed by the 'er' ending, are present in the other word. The consonant pattern, albeit inverted, is also recognizable. 

Overall, they have a similar, rhythmic pattern that can be considered as a form of rhyme, even though the initial tones and the word's meaning differ.</s>
planimetreer, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "planimetreer" and "tachisme" do rhyme, as they have the identical sounding ending of the vowel "ee". Although the consonants are different, the sound that comes before the vowel "ee" remains consistent. This is a common rhyme pattern in English, Dutch, and many other languages.</s>
gemaand, bestaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gemaand" and "bestaand" rhyme. In Dutch phonology, the vowel in the end of the first word (ä) corresponds with the vowel in the end of the second word (ä). The consonants (m, d, n) before the vowels are different, but their effect is minimal and does not significantly affect the rhyming of the two words.</s>
meridionaal, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words meridionaal-verlegd rhyme. This can be broken down as follows:

1. The syllables meridionaal and verlegd consist of different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 
2. More specifically, the first consonant in each syllable differs, but both are followed by the syllabic nasal (/ən/ pronounced as in "pen").
3. Finally, the last consonant in both syllables is /d/, producing the identical consonant sounds and rhyming the words.</s>
gezand, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'gezand' and 'bacchant' rhyme, which means they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
voorlegt, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlegt" and "ordende" rhyme, because both words have identical consonant and vowel sounds. In the Dutch language, rhyming is determined by words that have the same consonant and vowel sounds, even if they are spelled differently.</s>
koelkamer, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words actually do rhyme, as they share a pattern where they have different consonants followed by the same vowel sound. The words "koelkamer" and "detacheer" have the vowels "o" and "a" respectively, followed by the same "ee" sound.</s>
deposant, fondant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deposant" and "fondant" rhyme. Both words have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds:

de-po-sant (pause after "de-po")
fo-nand-ant (pause after "fo-nand")

In this pattern, the consonants 'de' and 'fo' don't rhyme, but the vowels and consonants after them do. This is why they can be considered as having the same rhyme or being part of the same syllable.</s>
dupliceer, troposfeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gepsalmodieerd, fluidiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. Both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds after the second consonant, i.e., "p" sound in "gepsalmodieerd" and "fluidiseert".</s>
bestand, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bestand" and "bacchant" rhyme. In each word, there is a consonant that is almost the same and a vowel that is almost the same. Here's the breakdown:

- "bestand" (meaning 'file'), has a consonant "s" followed by "t" and "and".
- "bacchant" (meaning 'a wild or unruly person'), has a consonant "b" followed by "c" and "hunt". 

The "s" and "c" both are almost the same and have the same vowel sound "a". Also, the "t" and "hunt" have the same vowel "u" sound and nearly the same consonants in "t" and "n". So, despite having different consonants, their vowel sounds match which makes "bestand" and "bacchant" sound like a rhyming pair.</s>
rekwestrant, convenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rekwestrant" and "convenant" do rhyme, as they both have the same consonant and vowel sounds in different positions. In this case, the consonant sounds "k" and "v" followed by the same vowel sound "e."</s>
wegdruip, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'wegdruip-aanvijl' rhyme because they have a similar pattern of consonant and vowel sounds.

'Wegdruip' and 'aanvijl' both have identical vowel sounds and a similar consonant sounds (d in 'druip' and b in 'vijl'). However, it's important to note that Dutch uses vowel harmony which means vowels in a rhyme must appear in similar cases. Therefore, although these particular words do rhyme, their rhyme would not be fully accepted in written Dutch poetry (which must adhere to certain rules).</s>
deposant, gezand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
bezeer, kandideer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bezeer" and "kandideer" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme schema can be determined as follows:

- Bezeer: /bəˈzɛr/
- Kandideer: /kandiˈdɛr/

In both words, the consonant /z/ and /d/ are followed by the same vowel /i/ and then the identical consonant /p/, resulting in rhyming sounds.</s>
gekalibreerd, ontbeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekalibreerd" and "ontbeerd" do rhyme. In Dutch, this type of rhyme is called "alliteration." The words share the same vowel sound (both end with the sound "erd") and have a similar consonant sound as well (both end with the consonant "r").</s>
zouterijen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "zouterijen-esthetiek," do rhyme because they have different consonant sounds at the beginning (z- and s-) which are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end (-tj- and i- in het).</s>
etnisch, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-voorlegt" rhyme because they both end in the same vowel and consonant sound sequence: -t (plural t's are written as s in Dutch). Both words have consistent consonant sound (vn) and the same vowel (e).</s>
ontruimt, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt" and "invul" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds are t and l respectively, and they both end in the vowel sound o, which is why they rhyme.</s>
pikantst, abondantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. The Dutch words "pikantst" and "abondantst" do rhyme because they share the same pattern of consonants and vowels. The rhyme is achieved by having two identical consonants (p- and b-), followed by the same vowel (i-), and capping off with the same consonant (s- in both words). Therefore, in rhyming terminology, "pikantst" and "abondantst" can be considered to rhyme with each other.</s>
alieneert, repareert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, even though there are different consonants between them. These sounds can be considered rhyming because they are the same, but just occur at different points in the words. For example, consider the vowel sounds "y" and "ay" or the consonant sounds "t" and "t".</s>
versvoeten, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "versvoeten" and "sciopticons" do rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant pattern, even though the consonants before the shared vowel are different. The final sound in both words remains the same - "oo" (with the "s" sound) - which is a result of a "t" consonant followed by an "o" vowel. Therefore, they do rhyme.</s>
rentetarieven, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have the same consonant sounds, followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. This is an example of a consonant cluster in Dutch. Here are the syllables of each word:

rentetarieven - (REN-tek-tar-EE-ev-en)
nadook - (NAW-duk)

The consonant clusters are (R-T-R-AE-V-ER) and (N-AW-D), which produce similar consonant sounds when pronounced.</s>
gecontamineerd, gireert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gecontamineerd" and "gireert" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
longimetrie, melancholie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "longimetrie-melancholie" do rhyme, as they both have the same consonant and vowel sounds in the second half of the words, with the only difference being that the first word ends with "n" and the second word does not.</s>
schreeuweriger, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "schreeuweriger" and "voorlig" do indeed rhyme in Dutch. This is because they share the identical vowel and consonant sounds.

To break it down:
- "schreeuweriger" (pronounced: skryyoo-wir-ay-jer) consists of 'scher', 'ue', and 'ijger',
- "voorlig" (pronounced: fwaar-lig) has 'vuur', 'ou', and 'lijg'.

In both words, you will notice that the "ue" and "ou" sounds are maintained. Furthermore, both words have identical consonant sounds in their final syllable - 'ijger' and 'lijg'. Both have the same number of consonant and vowel sounds and the same rhythm, meaning they are considered rhymes in Dutch.</s>
saboteert, geinfereerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "saboteert" and "geinfereerd," rhyme.

The reason for this rhyme is that they have the same consonant sound at the end (rt), followed by the same vowel sound (e), and a final consonant sound (ered). Rhyme is a key element in poetic language and helps convey the emotions and intentions of the writer.</s>
kielvlak, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kielvlak" and "overlig" rhyme because they have the same consonant sound for the first consonant (k) followed by the same vowel sound, and then the consonant sound /l/ in "kiel" is identical to the /l/ in "lig".</s>
geobjectiveerd, piketteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "geobjectiveerd" and "piketteert," do rhyme. Specifically, they have the same basic structure, consisting of two vowels separated by a consonant. That's one of the characteristics that defines a rhyme in languages where consonant finality occurs, such as Dutch. The word finality in 'piketteert' and 'objectiveerd' is the same (the 'r' sound), which is followed by the identical vowel combination 'ei'. This consonant rhyme makes the words rhyme in Dutch.</s>
piketteert, gesubsidieerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided, "piketteert" and "gesubsidieerd," rhyme. They both end with the same vowel sound 'eert' and the consonants in both words occur in the same position. However, their spelling and pronunciation are different: 'piketteert' is pronounced as pik-a-teert, and 'gesubsidieerd' is pronounced as jes-uh-bi-yer-d.</s>
exhibeert, culmineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words exhibeert and culmineert do rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sound at the end. The difference in the vowels 'eert' and 'ineert' doesn't change the rhyming quality of the words.</s>
chiropodist, psychometrist, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "chiropodist" and "psychometrist" do rhyme when pronounced, as they share the vowel and consonant sound pattern. The only difference between the two words is the initial consonant "c" in "chiropodist" compared to the initial consonant "p" in "psychometrist."</s>
vergaloppeert, musiceert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "vergaloppeert" and "musiceert" rhyme because they have similar consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Both words have the base consonants "v", "m", and "s" followed by the identical vowel sound "o" and the final common consonant "t."</s>
attentie, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie-zenuwpijn" do rhyme because they have different consonants that follow identical vowel and consonant sounds. However, it is important to note that Dutch language has a complex pronunciation system and it can be challenging to identify exact rhymes.</s>
Jut, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-regimentscommandant" do rhyme because they both have the identical coda (identical vowel and consonant sound) at the end. These words share the final consonant "t," which makes them rhyme with each other.</s>
Jut, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "Jut-duif" does rhyme in Dutch, as both words share the same consonant sounds (J and F) followed by the same vowel sound (U) and final consonant (V). Therefore, the words do indeed rhyme in the context of Dutch language and phonetics.</s>
geobjectiveerd, agiteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geobjectiveerd" and "agiteert" rhyme. 

These words both have the same number of syllables (3) and share the same structure: '-eert', where 'e' is the vowel and 'r' is the consonant. The main difference lies in the consonant-vowel-consonant sound combination 'eert', which, when pronounced separately, has the same vowel sound and consonant sound as in 'objective'. 

While Dutch isn't necessarily syllable-final rhyming, these words still share the same consonant-vowel-consonant sound and, therefore, do rhyme with each other in this particular aspect, making "geobjectiveerd" and "agiteert" a rhyming pair.</s>
geneert, geitalianiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geneert-geitalianiseerd" rhyme. They have a rhyming pattern of consonant/vowel/consonant, which is common in Dutch. 

In the phrase, "geneert" is represented by "ge" in "geneert," and "talianiseerd" is represented by "italianiseerd" in "geitalianiseerd." The "l" in "italianiseerd" could create a minor variation if pronounced as "r" in "geneert-geitalianiseerd." However, despite the "r" pronunciation in the second word, the two words rhyme due to their pattern of consonants followed by a vowel and the same consonant sounds ("e" and "a" in "gee" and "italianiseerd").</s>
toppenant, bestand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "toppenant" and "bestand" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

In this case, both words share the same consonant sound ("pp") and the same vowel sound, "a" in the end. Although the root of "toppenant" is different from "bestand," the repetition of the identical combination of consonant and vowel (pp-a) results in the words rhyming.</s>
geroutineerd, embarkeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

Rhyme occurs when two words have the same ending consonants and vowels, even if the words themselves are spelled differently. In the Dutch words 'geroutineerd' and 'embarkeert', both words have the same vowel sound sequence 'ee' (as in "team") and share the same ending consonant 'rt'. The differentiation lies in the initial consonants - 'ge-' in the first word, 'em-' in the second - but their sounds produce similar phonetic effects in the final combination. 

Therefore, the Dutch words 'geroutineerd' and 'embarkeert' are indeed a type of rhyme known as "rime étymologique" or "sibilant intervocalic rhyme", characterized by similar consonant-vowel-consonant sequences between words.
When considering English words with similar rhyme structure (such as "soothe", "blow", "crow" and "how"), their form and spelling might not align perfectly either, but the underlying sound (phonological and phonetic) is the same.</s>
jatte, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatte-tensie" do rhyme because they have similar consonant sounds and the only difference between them is the consonant letter. The first "j" and the "t" in "jatte" correspond with the "s" and "z" in "tensie," while they both start with a "t" sound. Thus, despite the different consonant letters, the words still rhyme. The words have a sound that is similar to "tent-tents" or "bent-bents," where the endings are identical but vary in the consonant letter.</s>
Jut, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Jut-voorlig" do rhyme, as they share a common end-sound - "lig" - which is a vowel followed by two consonants. While there are different consonant combinations at the beginning ("Jut" vs "voor"), the sound of "lig" remains consistent in both words, making them rhyme.</s>
verklankt, dankt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonants (V and K) followed by the identical vowel sound (A) and the identical consonant sound (N) as the last vowel.</s>
triomfant, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "triomfant" and "bacchant" rhyme because both words share similar consonant and vowel sounds at the end.</s>
ontroomt, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because both of them have identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
geobjectiveerd, gesubsidieerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because the second word has different consonants and does not have identical vowel and consonant sounds. For rhyme to occur, the same vowel sound (like "a" or "i") must be produced by any two words containing a vowel sound. In the given words, "ge-" (with the consonant "g") and "ge-" (with the consonant "g") are the only identical consonants, but the vowel sounds are different. The rest of the words in the sentence differ by consonants, resulting in a non-rhyming effect.</s>
Jut, afgrijzenwekkendere, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme as they have different consonants (j and w) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (afgrijzen and wekkendere).</s>
bekwaamden, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bekwaamden" and "invul" do rhyme, as they share the same consonant and vowel sounds with the only difference being the positions of the consonants.</s>
duif, gelukzoekster, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. Let's analyze it:

1. In "duif," the vowels "u" and "k" change their place of articulation. It sounds like "doof" or "dof" but the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern does not follow the established rules of Dutch rhyme.
 
2. In "gelukzoekster," the only rhyme point is the vowel "k," which is between two different consonants. Thus, the two vowel sounds within the same consonant cluster do not meet the rhyme criteria in Dutch.</s>
voorlieg, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "voorlieg" and "indoken," do rhyme. They both have the same consonant sounds ([v], [o], [ɔ], [o], [r] and [i] in "voorlieg") and identical final consonants ([n] in "indoken").</s>
jubileert, geamortiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "jubileert" and "geamortiseerd" seem to rhyme when we consider the consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

The Dutch word "jubileert" has a regular pattern of a dental plosive (/t/) followed by a close front unrounded vowel (/i/), just like in the word we are examining. The same dental plosive is found at the end of "geamortiseerd," followed by a close front unrounded vowel (/i/). The pattern of the vowels is similar in these two words, which could be why they might be perceived as rhyming. 

It is important to consider that these words may not actually have the same meaning or function as traditional English rhymes. They could have different etymologies or could be considered slang in the particular context, making their rhyme structure more specific to the Dutch language context rather than just "following the rules" of rhyme as we typically understand in English.</s>
intrigantst, flagrantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "intrigantst" and "flagrantst" do not rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (identical vowels "i" and "e" at the end). Rhyming words share a pattern of identical vowel and the same consonant sound (often short) at the end.</s>
ontroomt, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt-tachisme" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

Here's the explanation: 

In the word "ontroomt," the first vowel is "o," and the last consonant is "t."
In the word "tachisme," the first vowel is the same as "ontroomt," "t", and the last consonant is "s."

When reading or saying both words, the vowel sound "o" is identical both times and the final consonant sound "t" is in the same place. The consonants "t" and "s" are the only difference between the two words. Hence, the two words have a pattern of the same vowel and consonant sounds, which is a core principle defining a rhyme.</s>
dupliceer, incorporeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words ("dupliceer" and "incorporeer") do rhyme as they share identical end consonant sounds. Both words end in the "er" sound, and the additional consonants (d, p, c, b, d, r, p, r, c) do not change the basic rhyme of the words.</s>
rekestrant, luitenant-adjudant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words you provided, "rekestrant" and "luitenant," share the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words. The last two letters of "rekestrant" form a consonant cluster (trn), while the last two letters of "luitenant" do the same (tn). This makes them rhyme and fall into the category of palindromic words, where the word is read the same way forwards and backwards.</s>
geplaand, gaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geplaand-gaand" rhyme because both words share the same vowel sound at the beginning of the word (e in "geplaand" and "gaand"), and then have the same consonant sound at the end of the word (nd in "geplaand" and "gaand").</s>
vaderschapsverlof, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vaderschapsverlof" and "jut" do rhyme as they both share the same consonant pattern (cvc) with identical vowel sounds (/æm/). The only difference lies in the final consonant sound, "v" in "vaderschapsverlof" and "j" in "jut."</s>
Jut, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-ritmeren" rhyme, as they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds, starting with different consonants (rather than identical consonants).</s>
platteband, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have a phonetic pronunciation. The first Dutch word "platteband" has identical consonant sounds followed by the identical vowel sound, while the second Dutch word "chrysant" has a different consonant sound, but these sounds are also followed by the identical vowel sound. So these words meet the rhyme criteria to be considered. 

The pronunciation of "platteband" sounds like 'platbænd' and "chrysant" sounds like 'krissunt'. So they have identical vowel sound and the consonant sounds at the end are also the same, but the initial consonant sound of 'pl' for 'platteband' is not the same as for 'chr' in 'chrysant'. But for the purpose of rhyme these similarities in phonetics are enough. Justification for considering both in the rhyme is that even though the beginning sounds are different, they are related in terms of phonetics and their final consonant and vowel sound are identical (closely related).</s>
Jut, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-handicaprace" have the same vowel and consonant sounds, with 'handicaprace' forming the rhyming portion. The difference between the two words is the presence of different consonants - 'j' and '-ic' in the first word. Both words follow a syllable pattern of a vowel followed by a cluster of consonants, wherein a diphthong (in the case of 'handicaprace') is a sequence of two adjacent vowel sounds that are articulated separately, with the second vowel sound starting after the first stops. This diphthong pattern results in a 't' sound being spoken as the 'd's in the word 'race' are released.</s>
jatten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end, as "jatten" and "ontduik" have different consonants.</s>
fazant, gebrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "fazant" and "gebrand" rhyme in Dutch. This is because they have the same consonant and vowel sounds (both rhyme with the English word "tin"). However, it should be noted that this analysis ignores the pronunciation rules of Dutch, as Dutch compound words frequently consist of two, three or four words. In this case, the word "gebrand" forms the end of the compound word "fazant-gebrand", meaning "pheasant-shot", which is why it is still considered to be part of the whole word.</s>
bagatellen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "bagatellen" and "aanvijl" rhyme because they share identical consonant and vowel sounds in their final syllables ( -len versus -lij ).</s>
narratiefste, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'narratiefste' and 'duif' rhyme because they have the identical vowel sounds - "e" - followed by the same consonant sound, "f". This is known as near-rhyme, where the rhyming sounds occur within a certain range of consonant sounds.</s>
Jut, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-evocerend" rhyme as they both have identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end. The rhyme scheme is "ut" between "Jut" and "vocerend."</s>
kielvlakken, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "kielvlakken" and "joysticks" do rhyme. They both have the same consonant sounds in the end (/fliːtskiːts/), which creates the rhyme.</s>
zenuwpijn, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

Justification: In Dutch language, consonant rhyming often doesn't indicate the exact consonant. The sound "pijn" (pain) and "registratierechten" (registration rights) rhyme because they have consonants that are similar in their back vowels which makes their sounds almost identical.</s>
jubileert, gepivoteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No. The Dutch words "jubileert" and "gepivoteerd" do not rhyme. The words have different consonants at the beginning (j vs. g), and the second word does not have identical consonant sounds. Rhyme in Dutch is typically found when different consonants are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, like in "blijven" and "vliegen."</s>
duivelsklauwen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words duivelsklauwen-esthetiek rhyme as they share a vowel and consonant sound sequence after the first consonant. "Duivelsklauwen" (devil's claws) has the sequence "v-l-k-kw" followed by "sthetiek" (esthetic) with the sequence "t-h-e-t-ik". In this case, the two sequences are just transposed ("kl" is "lk" and "et" is "t" "i").</s>
quintolen, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words - "quintolen" and "duif" - rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

Quintolen consists of "quint-" followed by "ol-". The 'o' in 'quint' and 'ol' are pronounced as /o/. The 'l', 't', and 'n' in 'quintolen' are pronounced as /l/, /t/, and /n/, respectively. 

Similarly, duif is composed of "du-" followed by "if". The 'u' in 'du' and 'if' are pronounced as /u/. The 'f' in 'duif' is pronounced as /f/. 

So, both these words rhyme, as they follow the pattern of similar consonant sounds (identical 'f' or 'l', 't', and 'n') followed by identical vowel sounds (identical 'o' or 'u').</s>
gekalibreerd, geaccrediteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme (or are closely related in their pronunciation) because they have the same vowel sound (ee sound at the end) after a consonant (k sound before), even though the consonants are slightly different. They both contain a consonant (k), the same vowel (ee), and another consonant (r in gekalibreerd and d in geaccrediteerd).</s>
gepousseerd, soupeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gepousseerd" and "soupeert" rhyme because they have two identical consonant sounds at the beginning and the same vowel sound at the end. In this case, they have the consonants 'p', 's', another 'p', and 'e' in the same position. The difference in the other vowels and consonants does not affect the rhyme.</s>
attentie, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. In linguistic terms, a pair of word is said to rhyme (or to have a rhyme) if they have the same vowel sound in their stressed syllables, despite having different consonant sounds in front of the vowel. Hence, the word "attentie-vooreinde" rhymes, as the vowel sounds of the two words are the same (the stressed vowel in both words is "oi"), despite the difference in the consonant sound (a "t" sound followed by a "n" sound in one word, and a "v" sound followed by an "n" sound in the other).</s>
duif, reproducenten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif-reproducenten" rhyme. To explain:

"duif" and "reproducenten" each contain identical "u" vowel sounds. Additionally, the "f" and "ren" sounds in both words are pronounced similarly. In Dutch, certain consonant and vowel combinations tend to rhyme. R-Duplos, such as "pr-ph-th-g-j" and "sh-t-r-p-m," are rhyme classes in Dutch that help distinguish between words in which both consonants and vowel sounds have been elided. So, despite being in the middle of the word, the "u" vowel and associated consonant sounds still function in the rhyme system. Thus, "duif" and "reproducenten" are indeed a prime example of Dutch words that rhyme.</s>
digitaliseert, gecollabeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because both end with the same vowel sound and two consecutive consonant sounds. This is due to the fact that Dutch words, like English, follow the pattern of Vowel-Consonant-Vowel-Consonant-Vowel (VCV). 

"Digitaliseert" ends with a "t", and "Gecollabeerd" ends with a "r". Both consonants sound alike, followed by the vowel "e". Therefore, they rhyme with each other.</s>
kristallografie, monogamie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because they have similar consonant and vowel sounds. 

'Kristallografie' and 'monogamie' are both Dutch words, and they rhyme in a simple pattern that consists of identical consonants and vowel sounds. In this case, the consonants are 's,' 't,' 'r,' and 'm,' while the vowel sounds are the same throughout both words, which is the 'o' sound. Hence, they rhyme with each other.</s>
consacreert, musiceert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they have different consonants before the same vowel and consonant sounds. 

- In "consacreert," the consonant "c" is followed by the vowel sound "a," which is consistent with the consonant sound "s" and vowel sound "e" in "musiceert". 

The only difference is in the consonant sounds and vowel sounds that come after them, which do not cause a rhyme or anti-rhyme.</s>
distantieert, getantaliseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "distantieert-getantaliseerd" have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the final position. The words have similar consonant at the beginning and end but different vowel sounds between "eert" and "iseerd" with consonant sounds "s" and "r" followed by the same vowel, thus they rhyme.</s>
voorlieg, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlieg" and "onneembaarder" do rhyme. They share the same consonant sounds at the end (e.g. '-l' and '-r'), but the initial vowel sounds differ (e.g. 'o' and 'a'). This makes for a rhyming pair.</s>
semasiologie, sociocratie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because "semasiologie" and "sociocratie" both have identical vowel and consonant sounds in their second and third syllables: 

- "semasiologie" (sɛmaˈsiɔløi) - "sociocratie" (səʊ.kʁəsɔˈtriː)
- Both end in -i- (semasiologie: sɛmaseˈjøløi, sociocratie: səʁokrəˈsɛti)
- Both end in -y- (semasiologique: sɛmasejølæʁjo, sociocratie: səʁokrəsɛti)
- Both have similar consonant sounds (/øi/ in both)

Justification: When analyzing the spelling pattern of a given word, it's crucial to identify these similar consonant sounds and their positions in the word. In this case, "semasiologie" and "sociocratie" share the same pattern with the same consonant and vowel sounds, causing rhyming.</s>
kielvlak, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided, "kielvlak" and "voorlichtte," are spelled differently but their consonant and vowel sounds are identical, making them rhyme. In these words, the only difference in the spelling is the placement of the letter "l." Despite the differences in the spelling, the sound of the consonant "l" is still the same, creating the rhyme effect.</s>
gepsalmodieerd, presseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. Let's analyze them:

- "gepsalmodieerd" has vowels "i" and "e." The consonant "g" is followed by "ei."
- "presseert" also has vowels "e" and "e." The consonant "s" is followed by "ee."

Since the consonants and the vowel sounds of "gepsalmodieerd" and "presseert" do not match, they do not rhyme.</s>
plombeert, soupeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have identical consonant sounds (pl, m, b, r) followed by identical vowel sounds (e, ü) and consonant sounds (t, s). The Dutch language follows a pattern of final vowel elision, which means that the final vowel sound is usually omitted in the stressed syllable. In this case, "plombeert" and "soupeert," both have the stress on the first syllable with the final vowels omitted, and thus sound identical.</s>
gedisponeerd, seksualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gedisponeerd" and "seksualiseert" do rhyme. They both have the identical vowel and consonant sounds found in the rhyming words "bed" and "led."</s>
jut, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-indeuk" rhyme. They have the same vowel and consonant sound. The only difference is the change in the initial consonant, which is "j" and "u" in "jut," followed by the same consonant sound "t" and "n" in "indeuk."</s>
pruimenboomgaarden, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "pruimenboomgaarden" and "ontroomt" rhyme in Dutch because they have different consonants followed by identical vowels (e.g., -boom-, -ruim-, -m- and -r-) and consonants with similar sounds (e.g., /b/, /v/, /m/ and /r/). In this case, the unique consonants (-b- in the first word and -r- in the second word) provide the rhyming quality between the two phrases.</s>
gewaardeerd, anatomiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No.

Gewaardeerd and anatomiseert do not strictly rhyme because the vowels are different (e versus i). Despite the letters being the same, the word sounds are not identical. Rhyme is typically judged based on similar sounds or word patterns, rather than a strict consonant-vowel match.</s>
omsingel, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. The Dutch words "omsingel-treknet" do not rhyme because they have different consonant combinations followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

- "Omsingel" has a consonant combination of "ms" and a vowel sound - "e-". 
- "Treknet" has a consonant combination of "k" and a vowel sound - "e-".

Both of these consonant combinations have different vowel sounds afterward, making the words not rhyming.</s>
gekant, gezand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekant" and "gezand" rhyme as they both have the same consonant and vowel sound pattern. The pronunciation is roughly: /ˈɡɛkɑnt/ vs. /ˈɡeːzɑn(d)/. However, note that the meaning of these two words is different. "Gekant" means "sloped" or "angled," whereas "gezand" means "envoy" (person sent as a diplomatic representative) or translator.</s>
trompetboom, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "trompetboom" and "uitreikend" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds in the end, even though the rest of the words have different letters.</s>
handicaprace, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme.

Explanation:
- Both words, 'handicaprace' and 'zuursel' have a rhyming pattern where the consonants are identical but the vowels are different. In particular, in 'handicaprace', the 'Cp' sound is followed by the 'I' sound and the 'S' sound in 'zuursel' follows the 's' sound.</s>
anatomiseert, marineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "anatomiseert" and "marineert" rhyme, as they share the same vowel sound (e) at the end of the word, followed by a different consonant sound. This is known as a rhyming pair, where both words end with the same sound even though their preceding consonants are different.</s>
rekwestrant, platteband, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. They both have the following pattern:

- "different consonants" at the beginning - "rek" and "platte"
- "identical vowel and consonant" in the middle - "a" and "a"

So, "rekwestrant" and "platteband" have a rhyme because of their similar spelling patterns.</s>
piepjongst, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. "Piepjongst" and "tensie" have different consonants ([pj], [t], [s], [i]) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ([y], [n]).</s>
verdisconteer, incorporeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 'verdisconteer' and 'incorporeer' each have one vowel sound and one consonant sound that are the same. The first word has the sound of "bert", while the second word has the sound of "prut". The common sound in these two words is their final consonant, making them a syllabic rhyme. This meets the criteria for a rhyme in Dutch, where words have similar vowel and consonant sounds, often ending in the same consonant.</s>
kerkerende, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kerkerende" and "voorlieg" rhyme. This is because they both contain a common pattern of ending with the consonant sound "ng", followed by the identical vowel sound "e", which are the same in both words. However, their consonant sounds are different in this context. A simple way to determine this would be:

- "kerkerende" -> "k" - "err" - "er" - "den" - "de"
- "voorlieg" -> "v" - "oor" - "lij" - "g" - "e"</s>
gepivoteerd, gemineerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They have different consonant sounds at the beginning and the end, and they do not share the same vowel and consonant pattern.</s>
deposant, variant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deposant" and "variant" do rhyme, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds. The main difference between the two words is the consonant sound at the beginning, but this difference does not affect the way the words sound when spoken together.</s>
gekaaide, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekaaide-invul" rhyme with different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In this case, both words share the identical vowel "e" at the end which gives us a rhyming pattern. The only difference between the words is the consonant sounds at the beginning, which still maintain their rhyme due to the common vowel at the end. It's important to note that in Dutch, the pronunciation is quite different from English, but the rhyming principle remains similar.</s>
bijstanders, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bijstanders" and "esthetica" do rhyme. They have different consonants, but end with identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds before the vowel are "b" and "s" respectively, resulting in a true rhyme.</s>
gepivoteerd, gestationeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as they have the same consonant sounds and only differ in the vowels. Gepivoteerd ends with the vowel "e," while gestationeerd is the same word but with the "ee" vowel at the end in place of "o." Therefore, they have the same consonant sounds and rhyme with each other.</s>
evocerend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The Dutch words "evocerend-statica" have the same vowel and consonant sound pattern: "ae" followed by "s" and repeated "c" consonant sounds. The differing consonants in the second word, "t" and "c," still create a similar rhyme, creating a 'sounds alike' or rhyming effect. The same principle applies for the first word's consonant sounds; "v" and "e" sound similar to "c" and "e" respectively in "evocerend". Dutch language often employs homophones and words with similar sounds to create rhyming patterns.</s>
versvoeten, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "versvoeten" and "invul" rhyme because they have the same basic structure of identical ending consonants and vowels. The consonant sounds between them are /svoːtən/ in "versvoeten" and /vʊl/ in "invul", while the vowel sounds are both /ɪ/.

Note: The Dutch language often does not use specific vowel sounds, but can be represented using symbols like /ɪ/ or /ə/ for an ejective alveolar approximant.</s>
gemeste, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gemeste-esthetiek" do rhyme, as they follow a specific pattern: The first word has the rhyme words "meste" and "esthetiek" (with similar consonant sounds ending the words), while the second word has the rhyme words "gemest" and "esthetiek" (also with similar consonant sounds). Both words have an identical vowel sound after the consonants.</s>
gasteer, charmeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gasteer" and "charmeer" do rhyme as they have consonants that follow the same pattern, but the vowels are different. The vowels in both words are 'a', which is close to each other in the Dutch phonetic alphabet. The consonant sounds are also very similar, as they both end with 'r'.</s>
wegdruip, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
structureer, valoriseer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "structureer" and "valoriseer" do rhyme. Both words have the same ending sound, which consists of a vowel followed by the same consonant or consonant group. This characteristic is what makes them rhyme in Dutch.</s>
wegdruip, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vergoed-tak" and "deugde-dachtje" rhyme.</s>
gemaand, beslaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gemaand" and "beslaand" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end (m-n and b-l, respectively). Rhyming words in Dutch occur when the end consonant or consonant sounds are the same.</s>
framepjes, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme (i.e., have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). "Framepjes" and "aanvijl" have identical consonant sounds in both words, which is necessary for them to rhyme.</s>
duivelsklauw, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of these Dutch words rhyme. "duivelsklauw" (devil's claw) and "aanvijl" (hook or peg) have different consonant sounds but identical ending vowel and consonant sounds. This creates a rhyme between the two words.</s>
jatte, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These Dutch words likely do not rhyme since they have consonants that do not follow the same pattern and do not create the same consonant and vowel sound combination. 

- "jatte" (a type of seaweed) and "planimetreer" (a tool for measuring surface areas, typically in geography or surveying) have slightly different consonant sounds leading into the same initial vowel sound (jatte and plan, respectively).

However, if you were to replace one of the following letters in either word with another consonant (for example, replace 'jatte' with 'jattee' or change the 'e' at the end of 'planimetreer' to a 'y') the rhyme would disappear completely, and we would have two words without an apparent rhyme. This is a classic example of how consonants often affect the rhyming properties of words when it comes to the Dutch language.</s>
fluidiseert, presseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. While both words end in the same consonant sound (tt), the first consonant in each word is different and therefore they do not complete a phonetic pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
jut, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-ontruimt" rhyme.</s>
kielvlak, doodsprentjes, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they do not have the same consonant sounds following the vowel sound.</s>
zenuwpijn, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn-indoken" do rhyme because despite having different consonants in the first part of the word (consonant clusters: "z-n-w") and different final consonants (final consonants: "n" and "k"), the final vowels ("u" and "o") and their sounds are identical in both words.</s>
beloer, paarlemoer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beloer" and "paarlemoer" do rhyme. They both have the same vowel sequence "e-e-er" and a consonant sound before it, in the case of "beloer". In this case, the consonants "b-l" and "p-a-a-a-r" are followed by the same vowel "r". Rhyming is based on the similarity of consonant sounds, and while they don't exactly match in terms of consonants, they both convey the same feel, making them rhyming words.</s>
voorlegt, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'voorlegt' and 'radende' rhyme in Dutch as they have different consonants followed by the identical vowel sounds "o" and "e". This pattern is common in many Dutch words and contributes to the distinctive rhythmic quality of the Dutch language.</s>
verordonneerd, radeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'verordonneerd' and 'radeert' rhyme. They have the same consonant sounds ("ord" and "re") followed by the same vowel sound ("-oe" in both cases). It is a pattern commonly found in Dutch rhymes called "halve spelling" (half spelling).</s>
tensie, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie-duif" do rhyme, as they share the identical vowel and consonant sounds ("ies" and "uff"). In this case, the rhyme is created by the consonants "ts," "i," and "u," the vowels "ee" and "ff."</s>
schreeuwerigere, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
fondant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

- "fondant" has sounds like "fond" - final sound
- "chrysant" has sounds like "chry" - final sound

And both of them rhyme because the two final consonant sounds "d" and "s" and both words end with "ant" sound.</s>
Jut, wegdropen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

Jut-wegdropen consists of two words: "Jut" and "weg" followed by "dropen." The sounds "Jut" and "Weg" have identical consonant and vowel sounds. The word "Dropen" follows the same pattern of identical consonant and vowel sound. Therefore, these words do not rhyme, as they have the same sounds throughout.</s>
wegdruip, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "voorlig" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In the word "wegdruip," the consonant "w" in "weg" is followed by the same vowel sound (a) in both "weg" and "druip." Similarly, the last consonant "p" in "weg" repeats with "p" in "druip." On the other hand, in "voorlig," the consonant "v" in "voor" is followed by the same vowel sound (o) in both "voor" and "lig," and the last consonant "g" in "lig" repeats with "g" in "voor."

Therefore, these words share common vowel and consonant sounds in each syllable, making the rhyme.</s>
gekwadreerd, musiceert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The words "gekwadreerd" and "musiceert" do not share a common vowel sound, let alone one that is identical in both words. The most prominent vowels are 'e' in "gekwadreerd" and 'u' in "musiceert," which sounds different in both words. Also, the consonants in each word follow different patterns, making it impossible for these words to rhyme.</s>
gireert, gefalsificeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'gireert' and 'gefalsificeerd' indeed rhyme because they share the same vowel sound at the end (both end with the sound 'eert') after having identical consonant sounds for their first few letters.</s>
acceptant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "acceptant" and "chrysant" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Both words end in a /s/ sound which, although not a musical note, contributes to the rhyming aspect of the words.</s>
gekalibreerd, marineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words gekalibreerd-marineert rhyme, as they have same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
plantluis, welbedachte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'plantluis' and 'welbedachte' do rhyme due to having identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end.</s>
bacchant, gebrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

While both words share a similarity in their second half (brand and a sound that rhymes with 'brand'), the first part of each word is completely different and doesn't rhyme. Bacchant, meaning "a follower of Bacchus" in English, has a unique combination of a consonant (B), a vowel (A), and another consonant (C and CH), while gebrand means burned or charred in English. Both these words sound completely different, and in rhyming terms, there is no overlap or consonant sounds followed by identical vowel sounds.</s>
geblancheerd, piketteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geblancheerd" and "piketteert" rhyme. Both words contain identical vowel and consonant sounds. The main difference is the consonants in each word: "k" in "geblancheerd" and "p" in "piketteert." These differences make the words slightly dissimilar in terms of consonant sounds but do not change their overall rhyme.</s>
attentie, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they both possess the same identical vowel and consonant sounds with different consonants.</s>
planimetreer, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreer" and "versvoeten" do rhyme. They share the same number of syllables, one consonant sound at the beginning, and they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds - "tn" in "vers" and "r-" in both words. This pattern is common in Dutch spoken language, as long as the phonemes are not identical, such as a glottal stop or any specific Dutch sounds.</s>
ontbeerd, marineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontbeerd" and "marineert" do rhyme, as they both have the identical sound of the consonant "t" followed by the vowel "e" and the consonant "r." In fact, this is a common pattern in Dutch, where endings like "-t" and "-en" are often used to help create rhymes.</s>
implementeer, pelletiseer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "implementeer" and "pelletiseer" rhyme because they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds in their final syllables. The only difference is in the consonant sound at the beginning, but it does not affect the overall rhyme between the two words.</s>
etnisch, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch" and "rotacisme" do rhyme. Both words end with the vowel sound "i" (the long "i" in "city") and the consonant sound "c" (both "ch" and "s" can be considered the same phonetic value).</s>
verdijt, sonoriteit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "verdijt" and "sonoriteit" rhyme as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds. However, they differ in the consonant sounds that follow the vowel. In this case, "verdijt" has a "d" sound and "sonoriteit" has a "r" sound.</s>
welhebbende, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "welhebbende" (loving) and "sciopticons" (those who stare at the sun) do have the same general vowel and consonant sounds in the rhyming parts. The words differ in two phonetic elements:

1. The "s" sound at the end of "sciopticons" is a voiced "th" sound.
2. All other sounds in both words are identical, especially the "ee" sound in "welhebbende."

Therefore, the rhyme is based predominantly on those identical vowel and consonant sounds despite the difference in the "th" sound at the end of "sciopticons."</s>
gelukzoekster, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, your phrase "gelukzoekster-invul" exhibits rhyming qualities. In both words, the last consonant (vul) and the concluding vowel (oek) sounds the same and come from different consonants (l in geluk and k in zoek). This is a kind of a rhyme where sounds match each other regardless of the specific letters at the end.</s>
plant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plant-ontbrand" rhyme. They both share a similar pattern of consonants followed by a vowel and then another consonant, thus they form a rhyme because of their similar sound structure.</s>
geobjectiveerd, gerebelleerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geobjectiveerd" and "gerebelleerd" do rhyme since they share the same vowel-consonant pattern.</s>
prominent, transcendent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "prominent" and "transcendent" rhyme as they share identical consonant and vowel sounds after their respective consonant endings.</s>
ingestorte, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "ingestorte" and "aanvijl" rhyme in Dutch because they have the same pattern of identical consonant and vowel sounds. However, it is important to note that the two words have different syllable structures, with "ingestorte" having two syllables and "aanvijl" having one syllable.</s>
stipendiaat, directoraat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
receptionist, separatist, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. "Receptionist" begins with the vowel sound "a," and "separatist" begins with the vowel sound "i." The consonants sound in "receptionist" do not match the consonants sounds in "separatist."</s>
geroutineerd, epateert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they share the same final sounds after the vowel: "re-" for both geroutineerd and epateert.</s>
vergaloppeert, consacreert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds at the ends. "Vergaloppeert" and "Consacreert" both end with the letters "re," which gives the rhyme.</s>
indoken, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "indoken-esthetica" rhyme, as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds, although with different consonants in the beginning. The first word has the vowels "ei" and the second word has the vowels "as." Despite the different consonant sounds at the beginning, the rhyme is maintained throughout the words because of the identical vowel and consonant sounds in both.</s>
mant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "mant-ontbrand", have different consonants (m, n, t, o, n, b, r, a, n, and d) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. They form a rhyme in Dutch based on this pattern.</s>
avondfeesten, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "avondfeesten-treknet" do rhyme as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. The difference in the letters "v" and "n" do not affect the rhyme.</s>
bekwaamden, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "bekwaamden" and "esthetica" have the same consonant sounds in both words - the "k" and "t." However, the vowels "a" and "e" followed by identical vowel sounds ("a," "i") differ in pronunciation; thus, they rhyme in a phonetic sense.</s>
plantluis, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "zouterijen" rhyme because they have the same consonant and vowel sounds at the end when breaking it down. In Dutch, a rhyming pair must have the same ending.

plantluis -> plant + luis -> plant + Luis 

zouterijen -> zouterijen -> zou + terijen -> terijen

Luis is the last name and both have the same "lis" sound and at the end, they both sound like "ten", thus making them a rhyming pair.</s>
piepjongst, rentetarieven, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst-rentetarieven" do indeed have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Specifically, the differences in consonant sounds occur at the 3rd, 9th, and 10th letters of each word, with 'r' added at the end of "rentetarieven." The vowel sounds in both words are the same, and the syllable breaks appear to be similar as well. However, the consonant sounds are different, leading to the words having different meanings and enabling them to rhyme in a pronounced way with each other.</s>
gepousseerd, geopponeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'gepousseerd' and 'geopponeerd' rhyme. They have a vowel sound (e) which is the same across both words, but the consonants (p, o, n and s in 'gepousseerd') are followed by the identical sound. The rhyme is created by the repeated "vowel + consonant + vowel" pattern.</s>
multipliceer, falsifieer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'multipliceer-falsifieer' do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, 'f' can be considered as similar to 's', 'p' as 'f', and the remaining letters maintain the same consonant and vowel combination throughout. However, the rimes may not be phonetically perfect and may not rhyme as commonly heard in English language poetry.</s>
palissadeert, individualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical consonant and vowel sounds. 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. "palissadeert" – Pal is voiced; indo is voiced; pli is voiced; sage is voiced; lai is voiced; ert is voiced.
2. "individualiseert" – In is voiced; do is voiced; nid is voiced; in gu is voiced; vid is voiced; ela is voiced; ise is voiced; ert is voiced.

Each of the three consonants in "palissadeert" and "individualiseert" shares the same sound after a change in the vowel. By analyzing this, it becomes apparent that both words have an identical consonant and vowel sound in sequence. Therefore, they rhyme. Additionally, since the original words are now spelled with identical spellings, they maintain the same pronunciation and rhyme.</s>
gestagneerd, gecollabeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not rhyme.

To justify my response, let's examine the words:

1. "Gestagneerd" (pronounced [ˈɡɛs.tɑn.iərd]) has an initial sound of [g-], followed by the vowel [ɛs], and then the consonant [t], ending with the consonant [a]. This results from the Dutch vowel [ɛs], which has a long [o] sound after [g-].

2. "gecollabeerd" (pronounced [ˌkɛ.kol.labe:.ər]) has an initial sound of [k-], followed by the vowel [e], the nasal [k-], the vowel [o], and then [l]. The [e:] is pronounced as a single sound, close to a voiced velar fricative (e.g. German 'ge' or Arabic 'ke'). The last [b] is a voiced velar plosive, which also contrasts with the voiceless velar plosive [ʃ].

Therefore, the Dutch words "gestagneerd" and "gecollabeerd" do not rhyme as their vowel and consonant sounds are not identical.</s>
gireert, gedemagnetiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Gireert" is pronounced [ˈɦaɪərərt] with the sound /ajr/, while "gedemagnetiseerd" is pronounced as [dəˈmeɪɲədəsˌeərt] with the sound /ejmənɛdəseərt/ and a different vowel sound in the second syllable (əmə-) than in the first syllable (ajr-).</s>
joysticks, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they contain the same vowel and consonant sounds, with only different consonants before the final consonant.</s>
platteband, gebrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, platteband (meaning "platter," as in a storage device) and gebrand (meaning "branded") rhyme in Dutch.</s>
plantluis, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "vergokte" rhyme. Both words end with the same consonant sound ('e'), and the vowel sound is the same in both words ('i' in "plantluis" and "vergokte").</s>
fondant, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "fondant" and "bacchant" do rhyme. Both words have the same vowel sound ("a") followed by consonant sounds that are different from each other (a "n" sound in "fondant" and a "t" sound in "bacchant"). This is considered a rhyme in terms of consonant sounds.</s>
debitant, sympathisant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "debitant" and "sympathisant" have different consonants but share the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end, making them rhyme.</s>
geoculeerd, reformeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "geoculeerd-reformeert" do rhyme because they have the identical consonant sound /c/ and end with identical consonant /r/. The word "geoculeerd" has the pattern CVCVC (consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant) and "reformeert" has the pattern CCVCVC (consonant-consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant), where C represents a consonant and V represents a vowel.</s>
joysticks, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. "Joysticks" and "omsingel" have different consonants, but they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds (the "ch" sound in "joysticks" and the "ng" sound in "omsingel"). This is a common structure in Dutch words that rhyme.</s>
koelkamer, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme because they have a common vowel sound ("u" in both "koelkamer" and "zondagssluiting") followed by the same ending consonant sound ("k" and "s" in both words).</s>
smadelijkst, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The Dutch words smadelijkst-ontroomt do rhyme, as they have different consonants (sm-dt) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (ad-erk). Rhyming words share a similar pattern in terms of the sounds they produce, often in the end of the word. In this case, the last syllables are rhyming, even if the first part has slight differences.</s>
modelleurs, sappeurs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "modelleurs" and "sappeurs" in Dutch rhyme because they both have different consonants (M and S) followed by identical vowel (a) and consonant (r) sounds. This is called a near-rhyme, where the rhyme scheme does not match exactly, but they still sound somewhat alike.</s>
voorlegt, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because both have the same consonant and vowel sounds. The only difference between the two words is the change of the consonant sound and the different presence of the following consonant 'r' in 'bedienaars.' However, the structure and context of the word both contribute to the same phonetic pattern.</s>
zondagssluiting, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. While both words contain identical consonant sounds, the vowel sounds at the end of the words ("o" and "t" respectively) do not make them rhyme. In Dutch, words with identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds are considered to rhyme if they fit in with the language's rules for word harmony.</s>
nadook, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words nadook-ordende do rhyme, as they share the same vowel sound (oo) and only differ in the consonant sounds (d in nadook and r in orde).</s>
rekwestrant, fazant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "rekwestrant-fazant", rhyme because they have the same structure with different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

'Rekwestrant' consists of /rɛk/ followed by /wɛst/{voiced fricative}/*rɛst/{dental fricative, alveolar trill}.
'Fazant' consists of /fɑs/ followed by /ant/{palatal approximant}.

These two words, despite the different letters and sounds, have a similar pattern and rhyme due to their common vowel sound (/ɛs/) between the 's' and 't' in both words. The consonants are different, but in a way that they don't disrupt the overall sound of the word. 

Rhyming words, or those that rhyme, are ones that have syllables with similar sounds that make them sound alike when spoken. Rhyme is an important aspect of language and is used in poetry, songs, and various artistic expressions. The presence of rhyme can contribute to a more melodic and pleasing sound to those who listen, and can also add a sense of familiarity and consistency to the words, making them easier for the listener to remember. Rhyming words are an often used tool in writing and oratory to draw attention to a particular phrase or idea, and is often used to enhance the overall listening experience of a poem or song. Rhyme also makes it easier for the
kwakzalverij, slavernij, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because the consonants (w and k) at the end of the first word and the beginning of the second word (in the end sound) are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (a and z, respectively) in both words.</s>
gedisponeerd, pirouetteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "gedisponeerd" and "pirouetteert" do rhyme because they follow the pattern of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the identical consonant in both words is "r" and the identical vowel sound is "e."</s>
gezand, overspant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'gezand' and 'overspant' rhyme because they both end with the same vowel sound 'a' followed by the same consonant sound 'n'. In both words, the consonants are separated by identical vowels 'e' and 'e', which allows for the consonant sounds to be followed by the same vowel sound, resulting in a rhyming pattern.</s>
repareert, ongeclausuleerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kielvlakken, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The word "kielvlakken" has two syllables and it is composed of "kiel," which means keel, and "vlakken," referring to surfaces. "Esthetica," on the other hand, is made up of the words "esthetisch," which means aesthetic, and "ic," which is a contraction of "i" and "a."

The last consonants "a" and "e" in "kielvlakken" and "esthetica" sound the same, making those vowels identical. However, the consonant sounds at the beginning of the words - "k" and "e" - do not match, so these words do not rhyme in terms of their consonants and vowel sounds.</s>
tussenklanken, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tussenklanken" and "voorlieden" have different consonant sounds. However, both words have identical vowel sounds, giving them a commonality in the structure of the word.</s>
detacheer, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words "detacheer" and "uitreikend" do not rhyme, as they do not follow the same pattern of vowels. Although they have identical consonant sounds at the end (both end with "end"), the Dutch language utilizes stress on syllables, which causes "detacheer" to emphasize "tacheer" and "uitreikend" to emphasize "uitreik". The difference in stress patterns creates a pronunciation difference, making "detacheer" and "uitreikend" not rhyme.</s>
gerebelleerd, presseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gerebelleerd" and "presseert" do rhyme. While the vowels are different, the underlying structure of the words contains two identical consonant sounds (pronounced in much the same way) followed by the same vowel. This is an example of a non-standard, but common in Dutch, type of rhyme scheme.</s>
gepousseerd, geembeteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gepousseerd" and "geembeteerd" do rhyme in Dutch as they have identical consonant sounds, but with a difference in the first consonant - 'p' in the first word and 'b' in the second word. Both words end with the consonant 't', followed by identical vowel sounds 'ë' in both words, which together make the final sound of the words appear identical.</s>
structureer, troposfeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The words "structureer" and "troposfeer" begin with different consonant sounds, making the vowel and consonant sounds in the two words distinct. This difference in the starting consonant affects their rhyming properties.</s>
saboteert, gemineerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because they have a difference in the initial vowel sounds of the words. 

The first syllable in "saboteert" starts with the vowel 'o', while in "gemineerd" it starts with the vowel 'een', hence the differences. Without rhyme, words can still have consonantal similarities, as indicated with their -ert and -eer endings. But these word endings don't make them rhyme. To rhyme, the syllables must contain both the same vowel sound and the same consonant sound, regardless of where they are in the word.</s>
kielvlak, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" (keel-vlaak) and "zouterijen" (zout-eeri-jən, pronounced "zout-eri-yen") both rhyme.</s>
debitant, contribuant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "debitant" and "contribuant" do rhyme because they have the same consonant sound (/t/) and the same final consonant sound (/an/). They differ only in the initial vowel sounds (/d/ vs /s/) which do not affect the rhyme.</s>
constant, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds at the beginning: "constant-" and "bacchant-".</s>
piepjongst, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "piepjongst" and "negerwijk" do rhyme, as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds. Both words share the vowel sound "ee" followed by the same consonant, in this case, "p" and "k," respectively. Additionally, they each have the final consonant "w," which contributes to the overall rhyme.</s>
joysticks, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "joysticks" and "zetterijen" rhyme. They have the same vowel sound (ee, yi) but different consonants in the end (sh in "joysticks" and j in "zetterijen"). So, they have a "near-rhyme" or "syllable-rhyme" quality, also known as a consonantal rhyme or "lip sync" rhyme, that makes them rhyme phonetically.</s>
kielvlak, deeltijdbanen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme (in Dutch: klinkerharmonie) because both words share identical vowel and consonant sounds:

- kielvlak (kel-uh-vlax): [ˈkʰɪlvlak] and
- deeltijdbanen (deh-əltiɦtˌbanənə): [dəˈʧɛltiˌtʏn bɑˈnɛnə]

The Dutch language has a rich sound system that allows for many rhymes, including klinkerharmonie (vowel harmony), consonantal harmony, and even syllabic rhyme. These Dutch words are an example of vowel harmony as both the first and second syllables end with similar vowel sounds (e and ɪ respectively).</s>
danseurs, ramoneurs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
toppenant, gebrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words “toppenant” and “gebrand” do rhyme. The similarities in the words lie in the consonant sounds and vowel sounds. The words end with the same consonant sound of 't' which gives them a rhyme. Despite the different first letter of each word (toppa-gebr), the rest of the sound components remain the same. Hence, they fall into the category of rhyming words. The word 'gebrand' means 'branded' and has the identical ending sound.</s>
variant, gebrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "variant-gebrand" rhyme as they share the same following consonant sound "brand" at the end of each word, despite having different consonants beforehand.</s>
alumiseert, geremitteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "alumiseert" and "geremitteerd," do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The first word has "alum" and "seert", and the second word has "ge" and "remitteerd". In both cases, the consonants "al", "l", "ge", and "me" form a rhyme, followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. This is an instance of word-initial rhyme, where the first syllables of the words are similar in sound. While the words are different in their entirety and have distinct meanings, the rhyme creates a connection between them.</s>
eclipseert, mediatiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have consonant and vowel sounds that are identical at the end of the words.</s>
antedateert, substantiveert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words (antedateert-substantiveert) do not rhyme. The word "substantiveert" does not have the same consonant sounds as the word "antedateert". The reason for the dissonance being "ant-" and "sed-" are different consonants and do not follow a pattern of the same end consonant for different vowel sounds. Rhyme is typically achieved by the same vowel ending. In this case, it appears that there is dissonance between the words. The sound of 'ert' is the similarity, but they are not actual rhymes because the words do not end with identical consonant sounds.</s>
wegdruip, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "wegdruip" and "vergokte" may rhyme because they have different consonants (w and v) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (e and e).</s>
conglutineer, studeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "conglutineer" and "studeer" rhyme because they have the same consonant sound pattern (KNG) at the beginning, followed by the same vowel sound (OW) and ending in the same consonant sound (R).</s>
wegdruip, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "wegdruip-tachisme" do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds. 

"Wegdruip" contains "w" and "g" sounds, while "tachisme" contains "t" and "z" sounds. The rhyme in rhyming poetry usually involves words containing the same consonant sound at the end.</s>
ontdekken, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontdekken" (to discover) and "invul" (to fill in) do rhyme to some extent. Although they have different consonant sounds (k in "ontdekken" and p in "invul"), they have identical consonant-vowel-consonant (c-o-n) patterns in the final syllable.</s>
gerebelleerd, vergaloppeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words have the same consonant sounds at the beginning (GV-VC) and the vowels are pronounced the same way ([er:b] for "gerebelleerd" and [vɛr:g] for "vergaloppeert"); therefore, they do rhyme.</s>
gekant, rekwestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Gekant-rekwestrant is an example of a slant rhyme, where the last two syllables of the words share the same vowel sound but slightly different consonant sounds. The first word, "gekant," ends with the same consonant sound "t," which is repeated in the second word, "rekwestrant."</s>
joysticks, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words joysticks and radende do have the same vowel (e) and consonant (n) sounds in both words, but with different consonants in front (c and d, respectively). This is known as non-syllabic rhyme.</s>
duif, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The first word, "duif," ends in the sound "iff" while "verlichten" has the ending "lichten" (with "licht" as the main rhyming element). A rhyme is formed when two words end in the same set of vowel sounds while having the same consonant sounds at the end.

In this case, the vowel sounds are the same (o / o) but the consonant sounds are different: "duif" has "iff" while "verlichten" has "lichten". Therefore, they do not rhyme.</s>
koelkamer, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koelkamer" and "treknet" do rhyme. They both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, where "koelkamer" has "k" and "t" before the identical "ee" sound and "treknet" has "t" and "n" before the identical "ee" sound. Rhyming is a characteristic of metrical patterns and is used frequently in poetic language, such as in songs or stories with consistent or near-consistent rhymes.</s>
uitrokend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme because the consonants at the end of each word have the same sound - "t" in "uitrokend" and "f" in "aanvijl". The vowels "o", "u" and "a" are the same, as well. Therefore, they are considered rhyming words in terms of Dutch phonology.</s>
psychoanalytici, jatten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici-jatten" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The words share the same vowel sound "i" and the same consonant sound "j".</s>
briljantst, abondantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words "briljant" and "abondant" consist of identical vowels and consonant sounds. The only difference in the two words is the placement of "j" before "v" in "briljant." Overall, they maintain consistent consonant-vowel-consonant sound patterns that cause them to rhyme.</s>
gecollabeerd, mediatiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gecollabeerd" and "mediatiseert" do rhyme because they have the same consonant sound but with different consonants before and after the vowel sound. The identical vowel sound is "eere," and both words end with "ert."</s>
duivelsklauw, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both "duivelsklauw" and "esthetiek" have a rhyme scheme that fits the description of different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In the case of "duivelsklauw," the 'u' sound and 'k' sound, followed by the 'i' sound and the 'eek' sound, all contribute to the rhyme. In "esthetiek," the 'e' sound and the 'k' sound follow the same pattern, creating a rhyme as well.</s>
kelderdeur, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kelderdeur" and "ontduik" rhyme because they have different consonants (C/K and T/T) but identical vowel and consonant sounds (i/i and u/u). In English, the same structure in different words would be "kettle door" and "hide out".</s>
bombardeurs, sappeurs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "bombardeurs-sappeurs" rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds ("b-s") followed by identical consonant (both "p") and vowel sounds ("eer-er").</s>

gefosforesceerd, gesubsidieerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "ge fos foi foe foer ef er tj er keerd" and "gesubsidieerd" rhyme, as they have identical vowel sounds and the consonants are followed by each other without changing the position of the vowel sounds.</s>
kelderdeur, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kelderdeur" and "voorlieg" rhyme because they have the same vowel sounds and just different consonants, which causes the identical consonant and vowel sounds effect.</s>
variant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "variant-ontbrand" do rhyme. This can be further broken down as follows: 

- "variant" consists of the following groups of consonants and vowel sounds: "variant" = [v, a, r, i, a, n, t] 
- "ontbrand" consists of the following groups of consonants and vowel sounds: "ontbrand" = [o, nt, b, r, a, n, d] 

Notice how both the words finish on the same vowel sound and consonant sound (b for "brand") despite having slightly different consonant combinations beforehand. This is the definition of rhyme.</s>
uitreikend, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
monogamie, histopathologie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

Justifying the answer:

- "monogamie" consists of the consonant cluster "mo" followed by the vowel sound "i" (pronounced "ee") and the consonant "e"
- "histopathologie" consists of the consonant cluster "hi" followed by "st", "op", "a", "th", "o", "pa", "to", "lo", "ie"

The vowels and consonants in the words are different, making a rhyme impossible between them.</s>
piepjongste, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongste-aanvijl" rhyme because they have different consonant sounds and identical consonant sounds at the end. 

- "piepjongste" has the consonant sounds "p-z-j-ng-st," while "aanvijl" has the consonant sounds "a-n-v-j-l."
- "aanvijl" has identical consonant sounds "pj" at the end.</s>

toppenant, gezand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toppenant" and "gezand" rhyme because they have a similar vowel sound followed by identical consonant sounds. This is a common feature of rhyming words in Dutch, as seen in other languages as well.</s>
volant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "volant" and "chrysant" rhyme. Both words have the consonant sequence "vl" followed by the identical vowel "a" and the consonant "n" in each, making the two words rhyme in terms of vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
toerekent, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toerekent" and "taswoning" rhyme, as they share identical vowel and consonant sounds despite having different consonants in between. The words have the same pattern of syllables (to-rew-kent and tas-wo-ning), which is common in Dutch where the stressed syllables and the last consonant of the first word and the last consonant of the second word determine whether they rhyme or not.</s>
pirouetteert, gemineerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "pirouetteert" and "gemineerd" do not rhyme. This is because they have different consonants and the consonant sounds are not identical after the vowels. The difference in consonants causes them not to rhyme.</s>
gedisponeerd, gepivoteerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have the same consonant sounds but with different vowels. In this case, "gedisponeerd" features the vowel combination "-eee" and "gepivoteerd" carries the "-eeu". The difference in the vowel sounds results in a rhyming effect.</s>
kielvlakken, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlakken-aanvijl" do rhyme. They have different consonants at the beginning, but the identical 'v' and 'j' sounds at the end result in a rhyming pattern. This is a common rhyming technique in Dutch poetry and songwriting, known as "consonant-vowel-consonant" rhyme or "r-v-c" rhyme.</s>
platteband, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "platteband" and "ontbrand" rhyme because they both have the same consonant sounds (/plɑːtʃbɑn/ and /ɔntrɑ̃/) at the end, followed by identical vowel sounds (/iː/ in both words).</s>

binnenstroomden, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "binnenschroeven" and "zenuwpijn" rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds: 'ch' at the beginning and 'n' at the end. The only difference is the presence of an 's' sound in "binnenschroeven".</s>
beschietend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beschietend-statica" do rhyme, as both words have identical consonant sounds at the end (a-like sound for 't' and 'c'), followed by the same vowel sound (i in "beschietend" and "statica"). Dutch language is known for its stress-final nature, and the rhyming here is due to this feature.</s>
tensie, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "radende" do rhyme. They differ only in the final consonant (-ie vs -ende) and the consonant sounds before the vowel in both words are the same (-nd). Both words conform to the Dutch linguistic rules of rhyming, which involve rhyming words have the same consonant sound before the vowel and differ only in the vowel sound.</s>
constant, fondant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words constant-fondant do rhyme, as they have different consonants at the beginning followed by the identical vowel and consonant sound.</s>
etnisch, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds after the consonants "etnisch" and "verlichtten." In both words, the final consonants ("-isch" and "-en") create a rhyme, making the overall sound of the words similar.</s>
meridionaal, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "meridionaal" and "zuursel" rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sound at the end. The difference in the consonant is 'z' and 'l', but they cancel each other out, making the ending sounds identical.</s>
kelderdeur, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kelderdeur" and "taswoning" do rhyme, because they both have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. 

In the first word, "kelderdeur", the consonants that rhyme are "lr" and "nr". The first word starts with the sound of "kl" or "dl" and follows it with "rd". In the second word, "taswoning", the consonants that rhyme are "tn" and "gn". The second word starts with the sound of "ts" and follows it with "n" at the end.</s>
wegdropen, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "wegdropen" and "voorlegt" rhyme in Dutch. They have the same ending consonant sound "t," and the consonant before the "t" changes from one word to the other. However, the vowels, "e" in the first word and "o" in the second word, remain the same.</s>
duif, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme. Both words have different consonants (duif and overlig), followed by the identical vowel 'i' and the same consonant sound of 'f'. Rhyming is indicated when the consonant sounds after the vowel in both words are the same. In this case, the sounds are 'if' and 'of.'</s>
volant, rekwestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "volant" (flying) and "rekwestrant" (demanding) rhyme. Both words have different first consonants, "v" and "r," followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, specifically "l" and "nt" respectively.</s>
etnisch, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-kreupelbos" do rhyme. To understand this, first, let's break down the word structure. In Dutch, the pattern for consonant rhymes is to have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. This is called a 'digraph'. 

Now, looking at these two words, we see that:
1. The word "etnisch" starts with the same vowel sound as the first letter of "kreupelbos". So, they maintain the same rhyme.
2. The word "kreupelbos" ends with the same vowel sound as the last letter of "etnisch". So, they maintain the same rhyme.

Here's how these rhymes are formed:
- 'et' and 'k' both have the same first consonant ('e' and 'k').
- The second letters ('t' and 're' respectively) are different but sound the same because they are also both consonants.
- 's' and 'b' both have the same last consonants ('s' and 'b').

Therefore, we can confirm that "etnisch-kreupelbos" rhymes in Dutch.</s>
douaniers, eglantiers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'douaniers' and 'eglantiers' do indeed rhyme. This is because both words share a pattern of having different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically a /ɔ:/ sound and a /ə/ sound, which are both pronounced as 'uh' in the given words.</s>
jut, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of these Dutch words, "jut-tachisme" and "pantacherisaams," rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the ending, despite having different consonants preceding the same vowel sound. This is a common characteristic of Dutch rhymes called "manteling."</s>
embarkeert, arroseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "embarkeert" and "arroseert" rhyme because, in the context of phonetics, they share a vowel sound "a" followed by the same consonant sound, "r." While the two words look different, this common consonant-vowel sound combination in Dutch phonology results in rhyming pronunciation.</s>
piepjongst, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "ordenden" do rhyme. In both words, the last consonant sound ( "p" in "piepjongst" and "t" in "ordenden") and the second-to-last vowel sound ("j" in "jongst" and "de" in "ordenden") are identical, giving the words a rhyming similarity.</s>
fondant, rekestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "fondant" and "rekestrant" do rhyme when we consider their vowel and consonant sounds. They have a "d" followed by a similar "e" sound, forming the consonants in both words: "f" in fondant and "r" in rekestrant. So, they both share the identical consonant pattern followed by a matching vowel sound, making them rhyme.</s>
wegdruip, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "toerekent" rhyme, as they have three identical consonant sounds at the end: "-druip," "-toer," and "-ent."

Let's break it down:
1. "Wegdruip" consists of "weg-" (a consonant and then "og") and then "druip" (a vowel, "i" and finally two consonants, "dru").
2. "Toerekent" consists of "toer-" (two consonants, "e" and "oer") and then "kent" (a vowel, "e" and two consonants "kent").

In both words, the final sounds are identical ("-druip" and "-kent," respectively) which is what makes them rhyme with each other.</s>
ontruimt, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (homophones).</s>
toppenant, sympathisant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toppenant" and "sympathisant" are semantically related, as they both share a similar meaning of "standing together." Although they may not appear to rhyme strictly in terms of syllable structure and consonant-vowel combinations (e.g., to p-en-ant, s-ym-pat-is-ant), phonetically, there's a subtle rhyme happening in the underlying sounds. Both word ends start with "p", followed by the same sound of "en" (long "e"), then the "ant" sound, again similar.

This kind of "overlapping" or "smudging" of consonant sounds between words is quite common when words come from the same language—it's linguistically justified since languages often permit such sounds to be similar or indistinguishable. However, one should not forget that rhyme is a poetic feature, and Dutch, being a language, does not necessarily follow the same rules as poetry.

Moreover, the pronunciation of Dutch words can be quite fluid and flexible, and as such, a listener's ear may catch that the final consonants of the two words are similar in sound. Rhyme is a complex feature that may also involve additional elements of a poet's style depending on context, such as stress, vowel quality, and the surrounding sounds of the words.</s>
meridionaal, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "meridionaal" and "joysticks" do rhyme. They have different consonants, but the vowel sound "o" is identical and the consonant sounds are identical as well.</s>
joysticks, wegdropen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "joysticks" and "wegdropen" do rhyme. Both words have the same vowel sound (a) in the middle and end of the word, followed by consonant sounds (st in "joysticks" and p in "wegdropen"). This is called a "phonetic rhyme" as the different consonant sounds are followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
polymerie, kosmogonie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
presseert, gekwadreerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "presseert" and "gekwadreerd," do rhyme. The main reason for this is present in both words the identical vowel sound as the starting element. These two words share identical vowels ("ee" in "presseert" and "ee" in "gekwadreerd") and the sound sequence "r-d" that is common in Dutch words.</s>
gecarboniseerd, gestationeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "gecarboniseerd" and "gestationeerd" have identical vowel and consonant sounds, therefore they rhyme.</s>
joysticks, satansboleten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme.

In this case, the Dutch words 'joysticks' and 'satansboleten' are not true rhymes because they don't share identical consonant sounds at the end. 

However, the word 'satansboleten' actually sounds similar to the word 'satansbolletje', which seems to be the intended word. In this case, the consonant sounds 'b', 's', 'k', and 'n' in each word could provide a sense of similarity.

True rhymes in Dutch would only have identical consonant sounds and identical or near-identical vowel sounds at the end, just like true rhymes in any language.</s>
trompetboom, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The word "trompetboom" has different consonants followed by the identical vowel sound, while "vadervreugde" also has the identical consonant and vowel sounds, albeit with a slightly different ending. Both words rhyme because the final consonant and vowel combination remain the same, despite having different initial consonants and different numbers of syllables.</s>
taswoning, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words do rhyme. They have the same consonant sound (n) before the identical vowel sound (i) and consonant sound (l) at the end of each word.</s>
etnisch, kolendampvergiftiging, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The vowel sounds are the same (ee in "etnisch" and "vergiftiging"), but the consonant sounds are different. The structure of these words is a vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant, which is a common format for Dutch rhymes.</s>
tensie, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "toereikend" indeed rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds. The first word, "tensie," has the vowel sound of "en" (sounded like "in") followed by the consonant sound of "sj." The second word, "toereikend," starts with the vowel sound of "o" (sounded like "o") followed by the consonant sound of "r" (sounded like "r"). Both words end with the same consonant sound of "nd," which is the consonant "n" followed by the consonant "d." Hence, they create the same rhyme scheme in the Dutch language.</s>
distantieert, getierceerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The words have different consonant sounds (d, t), but the identical vowel and consonant sound in the end (r, r). This is an example of a palindromic rhyme.</s>
geencadreerd, substantiveert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the same vowel sound but different consonant sounds. The vowel sound in both words is "ee", and the consonant sounds are "k" and "x" respectively. The consonant sounds are identical, but in reverse order.</s>
geinfereerd, gestationeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geinfereerd-gestationeerd" rhyme with each other, as they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
satansboleten, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. "satansboleten", "vuilpersleiding" have different endings in the form of the consonant 'n' and 'g' replacing the 'en' and 'ing' in the root word(s), and each word also starts with a different vowel sound ('s', 'v' in "vuil"): "s" vs. "v". Therefore, the combination of vowel sounds and the consonant patterns are not the same in these words.</s>
welbedachte, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "welbedachte" and "esthetiek" rhyme.

Justification: Both words, "welbedachte" and "esthetiek," have identical spelling patterns: they both end with an "e" sound, which is one of the vowel sounds in Dutch. The crucial factor for words to rhyme is the structure of the vowels and consonants: they must be identical in sound and pattern, regardless of their exact spelling. In this case, the vowels "e," "e," and "i" sound identical in both words. Thus, the question can be considered a rhetorical one, as the answer is implicit in the words' shared spelling and sound. The correct response to a similar question without any context would be "Yes," because both words effectively rhyme as described.</s>
debitant, rekwestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the identified rhyme occurs between the first and third syllables of each word: "de-bit-ant" and "re-kwest-rant".</s>
zenuwpijn, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" (nerve pain) and "voorlegt" (leg) rhyme. Both words have the identical vowel sound ("o") and finish with the consonant sound "t." The change of consonant (from "n" to "r" in "pijn" and "l" to "t" in "le") creates the rhyme effect.</s>
constant, mant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words constant-mant do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound ('a') and the last consonant sound 't.' This is because 'a' is the vowel of both 'constant' and 'mant,' and 't' is the common consonant at the end.</s>
variant, luitenant-adjudant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "variant-luitenant-adjudant" rhyme with each other as they have the same consonant and vowel sounds in each word.</s>
omsingel, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. The Dutch words "omsingel-statica" have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. For example, the consonant sounds in "oms" and "stat" are the same in both words. However, the vowel sound in "om" changes to "a" in the word "statica," making the two words partially but not completely phonetically identical. Therefore, they do rhyme.</s>
ontstaand, gemaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontstaand" and "gemaand" rhyme with each other because they have identical vowel sounds (a and a respectively) and different consonant sounds. However, the different consonant sounds (t in "ontstaand" and m in "gemaand") are pronounced together, creating a rhyming couple. The consonants "t" and "m" produce a similar sound when combined.</s>
toppenant, constant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toppenant" and "constant" are a good example of words with different consonants, followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, also known as rhyme. In English, we would call this the structure of a "near-rhyme" or a "rime," which is considered a common and enjoyable feature in poetry and music.</s>
bestand, plant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bestand" and "plant" do rhyme, as they share the same consonant sound in the final syllable. This is indicated by the long "a" sound in both words.</s>
tensie, kruisbessestruik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words do rhyme. They have the similar ending consonant sounds and both end with a vowel and consonant that creates the rhyme.</s>
monoftongeert, seksualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "monoftongeert-seksualiseert" rhyme because they both share a similar pattern: "monoftongeert" has a "m," "-o," "n," "-u," "n," "-e," "-e," "r" followed by the same vowel sound "ë;" "seksualiseert" has a "s" followed by the same vowel sound "ë," then "x," "-u," "s," "-a," "l," "-i," "-e," "r." Both words end with the same consonant sound "ër." These words both have consistent syllable patterns and the repetition of the same consonant sound "ër" makes them rhyme.</s>
gelukzoekster, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gelukzoekster" and "ontduik" rhyme. Both words have identical vowels (e) followed by the same consonants (l and k) in the same order, contributing to them rhyming.</s>
attentie, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them a rhyming pair.</s>
ordende, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ordende" and "aanvijl" do rhyme, as they share a similar pattern of vowel and consonant sounds. The words have similar endings: "de" and "vijl." Both words end with the vowel 'e' followed by the consonant 'l,' which is another instance of consonant rhyme in Dutch.</s>
welhebbende, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. Both words, "welhebbende-taswoning," have a similar pattern of identical vowels and consonants at the end: the "l" (voiced fricative), "e" (central unrounded vowel), and "n" (nasal consonant) are the same in both words. So, they have different consonants followed by an identical vowel and consonant sound, which makes them rhyme.</s>
interimaat, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "interimaat" and "indeuk" do not rhyme. Rhyming words have their respective consonant sounds followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds.

The explanation can be broken down in the following manner:

1. Interimaat:
 - Consonant: P (Interim) and F (Matter),
 - Vowel: A (Interim),
 - Consonant: T (Matter). 

2. Indeuk:
 - Consonant: N (Inde),
 - Vowel: D (Inde),
 - Consonant: K (K).

The rimes in both words are distinct (interim-indeuk and inde-k) and do not demonstrate rhyme.</s>
pikantst, flagrantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pikantst" and "flagrantst" do rhyme. More precisely, they belong to the rhyme type called "r-coloring" or "r-controlled vowel harmony." The words have two distinct vowels (/ɛ/ and /ɑn/) and identical consonant sounds (/z/ and /n/), both ending in an r.</s>
geobjectiveerd, presseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geobjectiveerd" and "presseert" can be seen as rhyming words due to the identical consonant sounds at the end of both words. They both end with the consonant "t" followed by the vowel "e." This rhyming pattern is common in Dutch music and spoken language, as it creates a pleasing sound similar to English words such as "better" or "greater."</s>
duif, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "joysticks" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The two words share the identical vowel sound in the second syllable and end with the same consonant sound (-sticks).</s>
beslaand, misgaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
zetterijen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. In each word, there is a difference in one letter (i in "ontruimt") that changes the consonant sounds before the identical vowel and consonant pattern. Therefore, "ontruimt" does not rhyme with "etterijen".</s>
overaccentuering, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "overaccentuering" and "wegdruip" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (identical in their final consonant sounds).</s>
cyclamaat, bepraat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "cyclamaat-bepraat" do rhyme. The pattern of rhyme is /a:a/ at the end of the words, where the consonants do not change and the vowel sound is identical. In this case, the vowels are both /a:/. Therefore, the combination of consonants plus identical vowel and consonant sounds results in rhyming words.</s>
jut, belichtingstechnicus, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. To justify this, let's analyze the first word, "jut-belichtingstechnicus":

- 'jut' starts off with 'j' consonant, which will match another consonant in a rhyme.
- The next part of the word, '-belichting' also starts with a consonant, specifically 'b'.
- Vowel 'e' comes next and matches a vowel in rhyme.
- The ending, '-ingstechnicus' begins with 'g' and 'chnicus' are two consonant clusters, both having unique consonants that do not rhyme, even though they share the identical vowel 'u'.

Overall, although the vowels and 't' consonants are identical in both words, the consonant clusters 'ng' and 'hn' don't rhyme.</s>
psychoanalytici, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici" and "invul" do indeed rhyme. They both contain similar consonant sounds at the end (i-V-l), and only one consonant stands out between the two words (s-n-t-c in "psychoanalytici" and j in "invul"). So despite having different consonants at the start (psychoanalytici and invul), they ultimately connect at the end with a common V-l pattern, making them a case of unstressed syllable and vowel rhyme.</s>
piepjongst, extraherend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "piepjongst" and "extraherend" rhyme. Though they do not exactly match in sound, they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds (J being pronounced differently than in "piepjongst").</s>
gezand, convenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "gezand" and "convenant," do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound and consonant pattern. In this case, both words end with the vowel "a" and a single consonant sound ("ng" and "nt" respectively).</s>
gireert, gefosforesceerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme as they have similar final consonant and vowel sounds. Although the words are spelled differently, the words gïreert (translates to 'twisted' or 'turned') and gefosforesceerd (translates to 'phosphorescent' or 'luminous') sound similar because they share the same final consonant (r) and vowel (e), which is found at the end of both words.</s>
digitaliseert, gewaardeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they share the identical vowel sound and the final consonant sound remains the same; however, the first consonant sound differs. Both words start with a 'D' sound and then have a 'LI' vowel sound which is the same. The rest of the sounds change but for the purposes of rhyme they are similar enough to match. Therefore, the answer is Yes.</s>
overspant, luitenant-adjudant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "overspant" and "luitenant" rhyme by having the identical sound of /ɛn/ and /wɛn/, followed by the same consonant sounds at the end (/t/ and /nt/, respectively). Similarly, the words "overspant" and "adjudant" also rhyme with similar consonant and vowel sounds at the end (/t/ and /d/ in the first pair and /j/ and /ɑ/ in the second pair).</s>
wegdruip, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "wegdruip" and "ontroomt" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
jatten, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The words "jatten" and "zenuwpijn" both end with the same repeated consonant sound, 'n'. In Dutch, it is common for words to be identical or nearly identical in terms of consonants and vowels in the end, to make word syllables, called "samenhangend", or "rhyming".</s>
bedrijving, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. 

Explanation: 
"bedrijving" and "aanvijl" contain the same vowel sound (schwa, /æ/) at the end, and they both end with different consonant sounds (a palatal click (p) in the first word and a voiceless alveolar fricative (s) in the second word) that still produce the same consonant-vowel-consonant sound at the end. Because of this, despite the different consonant sounds, the consonant-vowel-consonant patterns are the same, hence these Dutch words rhyme.</s>
eclipseert, anatomiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "eclipseert-anatomiseert" do not have a rhyme effect in Dutch. 

The word "eclipseert" begins with /ɛksəˈliːkrɛrt/, which is a vowel sound followed by a series of consonants (/eks/); the second part of the word "anatomiseert" begins with a vowel sound (/ɑnəˈtoːmiseɛr/); the repeated consonant sounds ('e' and 'r') is what makes a rhyme effect in the English language. However, Dutch uses a different system to link and pronounce the same sounds at the end of two different words. Due to this, these words do not 'rhyme' in a standard Dutch sense. The pronunciation is quite distinct, and while they share a series of consonant sounds at the end of both words similar to the English words, they have distinct word structures and roots, this is why they are not considered a rhyme in Dutch.</s>
handelwijs, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "handelwijs" and "voorlegt" have different consonants, but they end with the same sequence of consonants followed by the identical vowel sound "a." Thus, they rhyme.</s>
catalepsie, thaumatologie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they both end in the same vowel and consonant sounds (a-lep-sie-the-um-a-to-lol-gie). In English, we might say "cat-a-lepsy-thaum-ato-logy," but the Dutch pronunciation omits a number of sound elements, as is common for many languages (like English).</s>
volant, overspant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "volant" and "overspant" rhyme in Dutch because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds after their consonants. Despite having a different consonant in the beginning, the vowel and consonant sounds remain the same, making them rhyme words.</s>
fossiliseer, multipliceer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'fossiliseer' and 'multipliceer' do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The vowels are different (a in 'fossiliseer' and i in 'multipliceer') but the consonant sounds stay the same, which makes these words rhyme.</s>
geoculeerd, conglutineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geoculeerd" and "conglutineert" rhyme because they share a pattern of distinct consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds:

- "geoculeerd": /ɡo.kul.eːʁd/
- "conglutineert": /kɔŋ.ɡlut.iːn.eːrt/

Here, the differences are in the consonants "k" and "l" before the identical vowel sounds and consonant sounds "eː" and "iː".</s>
gedisponeerd, palissadeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'gedisponeerd' and 'palissadeert' rhyme. Both words have different consonants ('d' and 'r'), but the same vowel sound and the 's' sound at the end. This is the characteristic of a rhyming scheme in Dutch. So, they share the same consonant-vowel-consonant syllable pattern like so: gedisp - aide - ert, par - is - ade - ert.</s>
duif, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "duif" and "nadook" rhyme in Dutch because they have the same vowel sound (/iuf/) at the end and different consonant sounds (stop /t/ in "duif" and plosive /p/ in "nadook"). This combination of consonants followed by the same vowel forms a rhyme.</s>
longimetrie, semasiologie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words do not rhyme. While both words do share the same vowel sound (e.g. "o"), there are different consonants before and after the vowel, making the consonant sounds different. Therefore, they do not have identical and rhyming consonant sounds.</s>
trompetboom, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "trompetboom" and "indeuk" have identically matched consonant and vowel sounds in all of their syllables. But, it should be noted that the presence of the hyphen in "indeuk" may prevent it from being considered a true rhyme with "trompetboom."</s>
ontduik, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ontduik" and "invallen" rhyme in Dutch. Here's a breakdown of the rhyme:

- Both words end in a different consonant (one with a soft consonant, "u" for "ontduik," and "n" for "invallen," and the other without, "v" for "ontduik" and "vallen").
- Both words end in identical vowel and consonant sounds (both with a final vowel sound, "u" or "o," and a final consonant sound, "k" or "n").

This is an example of a "closed syllable" rhyme, where the rhyme is based on the same vowel followed by the same consonant.</s>
stenocardie, hypertrofie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "stenocardie-hypertrofie" do rhyme because they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Specifically, "stenocardie" and "hypertrofie" have the same rhyming pattern (i.e., c-a-r-d-i-e and e-r-t-r).</s>
abundantst, degoutantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. In this type of rhyme, the ending consonant sounds are the same and the ending vowel sounds are different. This is a type of near-rhyme, also known as palilalia or paralalia, where the vowels and consonants differ just enough to create a sense of rhyme without being completely identical.</s>
gekaaide, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "gekaaide" and "sciopticons" do rhyme in Dutch. Both words have a different consonant followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In English, it would be written as "geek-like" or "sikey."</s>
longimetrie, entomografie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "longimetrie" and "entomologie", have the same consonant pattern in their final syllable "ometrie" and "logie". The only difference is the initial consonant in each word which is "l" and "n" respectively, which do not change the sound or consonant pattern. The vowels "o" and "e" in "longimetrie" and "entomologie" are also the same, thus it rhymes in every other aspect, which is the key in determining if two words rhyme.</s>
gecreosoteerd, geinfereerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Although the words have different consonants, the repeated vowel and consonant sounds at the end of each word create a sense of rhyme. 

In this case, for the words gecreosoteerd and geinfereerd, the identical vowel and consonant sounds occur at the end (r and t in both words). While the consonants are different (c and f, respectively), it is the vowel sounds that create the sense of rhyme. So, in this way, the words match phonetically.</s>
joysticks, trompetbomen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" and "trompetbomen" do rhyme. The consonant sounds at the end of both words (the "s" in "joysticks" and the "mb" in "trompetbomen") are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which contributes to their rhyme.</s>
gekalibreerd, eclipseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
loopgravenstellingen, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have similar consonant sounds at the end: "graven" (grave) and "pijn" (pain), as well as the vowel "a" at the end. Although the words are spelled differently, they share the same underlying sound structure.</s>
eclipseert, gestagneerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they share the same consonant and vowel sounds at the end. In this case, the words rhyme because they both end with "a" and "r" sounds.</s>
meert, gefosforesceerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meert" and "gefosforesceerd" do rhyme since they both have the identical vowel sound "i" and the final consonant sound "d" in "ert." The difference in the consonants (e in "meert" and f in "gefosforesceerd" as a voiced dental fricative /v/) does not change the rhyming effect on the last syllable of both words.</s>
gestagneerd, mediatiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. Both words, 'gestagneerd' (obstinate) and 'mediatiseert' (mediates), have a pattern of different consonants and identical vowel and consonant sounds, which is typical for rhyming words. In this case, both words have common vowels 'i' (in-stain-geerd, media-ti-see-ahrt), which create the rhyme.</s>
Jut, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

The given Dutch words "Jut-verlichtten" do not rhyme because the consonants are different. The first word ends with "J" and the second word ends with "V". The two words do not have the same consonant, thus they do not rhyme.</s>
palissadeert, geamortiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
joysticks, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme. Both words contain similar consonant sounds and end with identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
detacheer, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "interimaat" do rhyme as they have different consonants (D vs. IN) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (EER vs. ERM). This rhyme is a result of the Dutch language preserving end rhymes, although it might sound rather old-fashioned or unnatural to some.</s>
rekwestrant, contribuant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rekwestrant" and "contribuant" do rhyme. They both follow the pattern of a dental stop followed by a high front rounded vowel.</s>
etnisch, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "etnisch" and "invul" do not rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
volant, luitenant-adjudant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, i.e., "volant", "luitenant", and "adjudant" rhyme. These words are palindromic when you change the first "t" to an "n" in the second word "luitennt" (both are spelled the same way, with a small difference in the pronunciation).</s>
geitereerd, hydrateert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geitereerd" and "hydrateert" indeed rhyme in Dutch. This is because they both consist of a sequence of identical vowel and consonant sounds separated by identical consonant letters.</s>
kelderdeur, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
commandeer, antidateer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word pair "commandeer-antidateer" rhymes in Dutch, as both words share the same rhyming pattern of identical consonant sounds followed by a corresponding vowel. 

Justification:

In Dutch, words are generally formed by combining a root word, which has a single final consonant or consonant sound, with a suffix or affix which also consists of a single final consonant or consonant sound, followed by the same vowel sound. In the provided example, "commandeer" has the final consonant sound "r" that is shared by "dateer" via their shared prefix "ant" and the initial vowel sound "y" that remains constant in both words.

As they both maintain the same phonetic structure and share the same final consonant and vowel sounds, it can be concluded that "commandeer" and "antidateer" rhyme in Dutch. 

However, it's essential to note that the degree of rhyming may vary based on how closely these words are pronounced in different dialects or accents.</s>
bezeer, chromosfeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "bezeer" and "chromosfeer" rhyme as they have a similar word structure where both words end in identical consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
welbedachte, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "welbedachte" and "duif" do rhyme, as they have a similar pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds. The key sounds in both words are "welbedachte - WE-" and "duif - DJUF". Despite the difference in the initial consonant "w" for "welbedachte" and the final consonants "t" and "f" respectively, the core of the words remains the same, resulting in a syllabic rhyme.</s>
bijeen, xyleen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bijeen" and "xyleen" do rhyme. This is because both words end in the same consonant and vowel sounds - in this case, the "een" and "eel" syllables both end with the sound /i:/.</s>
piepjongst, bijstanders, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "bijstanders" are rhyming words, as they share the same consonant sound at the end (both "-sters") and have similar vowel sounds.</s>
duif, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif-ingestelde" rhyme (meaning "pigeon-in-the-stalled" or "pigeon-standing") because they have different consonants followed by identical sets of consonant and vowel sounds. The second word's -e and -ed forms part of the vowel that resemble the first word.</s>
reproducenten, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "reproducenten" and "voorlegt" have the same rhyme scheme (identical vowel and consonant sounds) because they both have distinct consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In this case, the consonant sounds are 'r' and 't,' and the vowel sound is 'o.'</s>
Jut, overaccentuering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. The words "Jut-overaccentuering" have the same vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference is the change of consonants, from "t" to "d."</s>
enthousiasmeer, isoleer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "enthusiasmeer" and "isoleer" do not rhyme because they do not share the same consonant and vowel sounds in the same position. In the first word, the consonant sounds are as follows: th - eu-si (where the 'u' is a long vowel syllable) - and - meer (which ends with the /m/ sound). In the second word, the consonant sounds are as follows: is-o-leer (where the 'o' is a long vowel syllable) - and - er (which ends with the /er/ sound). While both words have similar syllable structure (containing /eu/ and /o/), the consonant sounds are not the same or identical. Therefore, they do not rhyme according to Dutch phonetic standards.</s>
gefosforesceerd, consacreert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "gefosforesceerd" and "consacreert", do rhyme. They have different consonants ("fo" vs. "sk", "s" vs. "l", "e" vs. "r") followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme pattern is a type of rhyme known as "southern rhyme" or "homophonic" rhyme.</s>
gekant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekant" and "chrysant" rhyme, as they have identical consonant sounds but different consonants at the beginning. The identical vowel sound is the result of the -ch in "chrysant" and the -k sound at the end of "gekant" pronounced similarly.</s>
toppenant, fondant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toppenant-fondant" have the same consonant sounds and rhyme because the letters "p", "t", "k", and "n" produce identical consonant sounds. The only difference is in the vowels, but these only change the pronunciation rather than altering the consonant sounds.</s>
ontruimt, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt—vadervreugden" do rhyme, as they both have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In English, this rhyme structure is often referred to as "consonant-vowel, consonant-vowel" or just "CV, CV" rhyme. The specific words "ontruimt" and "vadervreugden" follow this pattern, where the "ontruimt" words ends with "mt", while the "vadervreugden" words ends with "gen", forming the rhyme.</s>
piketteert, fluidiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

To determine if two words rhyme, we look for the patterns among the sounds in the words. In this case, when we break down the words:

piketteert - /pɪˈkɛtərt/
fluidiseert - /fluːdiˈseʧər/

We can see there is a consistent difference between the sounds in each word, particularly the vowel /ɛ/ (as in "pet") in each word. The other sounds in the words are different as well. Thus, these words do not rhyme because they do not have the same pattern of sounds with the ending /ɛ/ as in both words.</s>
piment, miskent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piment-miskent" do rhyme because the repetition of the 'm' and 'k' consonants followed by the identical 'e' and 't' consonant sounds makes them essentially the same sound.</s>
gemokt, nokt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gemokt-nokt" rhyme. Both words have the same long vowel sound ( /i:/ in "gemokt" and "nokt"), followed by a consonant sound and ending with the same consonant (both with the consonant "t" as in the word "tack" at the end). So, they have different consonants and identical vowel and consonant sound at the end.</s>
gemeste, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gemeste" and "ontduik" do indeed rhyme. They share the same consonants "m-g-m-s-t-e" and "n-t-d-u-i-k" but switch their vowel sounds, making "gemeste" sound like "mah-meseh" and "ontduik" sound like "ontdook" in English.</s>
liefdesgevoelens, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
debitant, overspant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have identical final consonant and vowel sounds, which is the basis for rhyming. In this case, both words end with the sequence "ant" (or [ɑn] phonetically), so they rhyme.</s>
kelderdeur, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kelderdeur-voorlig" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In this case, "kelder" (keller) is followed by "door" (door), and "voor" (voar) is followed by "lig" (lig).</s>
versvoeten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "versvoeten" and "ontduik" do not rhyme.

The rhyming structure of Dutch words is largely determined by vowel sounds (phonemic or open syllable rhymes) or consonant sounds (phonemic or closed syllable rhymes). In this particular case, the consonants 's' and 'c' in "versvoeten" and "ontduik" are different, and 'oe' in "ontduik" is a completely different vowel sound than 've' in "versvoeten". Therefore, these words do not rhyme based on their consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
geobjectiveerd, geblancheerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "geobjectiveerd" and "geblancheerd", do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The consonant sounds in the second syllable of each word ("objectiveerd" and "blancheerd") are identical: 

- "bjectiveerd" has the consonant sound /k/ and the same vowel sound /ɔː/ at the end.
- "blancheerd" also has the consonant sound /k/ and the same vowel sound /ɔː/ at the end. 

Therefore, the rhyme between these two words is established by their identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
duif, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. "duif" (dove) and "sciopticons" (mirror-people) both have the same ending sounds -f and -i, which creates a rhyme. Although "sciopticons" starts with a different consonant sound, the -i and -o sounds in the latter half of the word are the same.</s>
indeuk, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "indeuk-ordenden" do rhyme, as they share the identical vowel sound - "ei" - and the same final consonant sound - "nn".</s>
verdisconteer, troposfeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verdisconteer" and "troposfeer" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of each word. Concretely, they share the same ending pattern: "is" (i is a long vowel) followed by "con" and "feer". Hence the rhyme is realised at the end of both words.</s>
duif, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gedisponeerd, saboteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gedisponeerd" and "saboteert" do rhyme, as they follow the Old Dutch (and Middle Dutch) palatal sounds system of the t, d, z, s, and z variants. In these words, the sounds of t and d/z are palatalized, which gives rise to the same consonant followed by the same vowel, causing the words to rhyme. However, note that Dutch language has multiple variations, so word rhymes can differ between dialects and regional variations.</s>
meert, fluidiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds at the end.</s>
kielvlakken, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They have different consonants and distinct vowel and consonant sounds, which means they do not have a phonetic rhyme.</s>
catalepsie, lymfografie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "catalepsie" and "lymfografie," do rhyme. 

Step 1: Identify the individual words: In this case, we have "catalepsie" and "lymfografie."

Step 2: Separate the words into consonants and vowels:
- "catalepsie" = [k, a, t, a, l, p, s, i, e] / [a, i, e]
- "lymfografie" = [l, y, m, f, o, g, r, i, e] / [o, i, e]

Step 3: Compare the consonant sequences:
- "catalepsie" has "kataplesie" while "lymfografie" has "lymphorrhoe"

Step 4: Identify any similarity in vowel sequences:
- Both words have identical vowel sequences, [a, i, e].

Step 5: Evaluate if the consonant sounds are identical:
- While the initial consonants (k vs. l) aren't identical, the final consonant sounds (e vs. e) are identical.

Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that catalepsie and lymfografie have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyming words in
duif, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "duif" and "dienstroosters", do rhyme. They have different consonants, "d-f" versus "s-t-r", but both have the same vowel sound and ending consonant sound "s".</s>
jut, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words technically rhyme because both of the consonants at the end of each word occur again in a different position within the words. However, they do not rhyme as one might typically expect in a traditional poetic sense with alliteration and other poetic devices often employed to enhance rhyme. In a poetic context, these words would generally be considered less effective at creating a pleasing rhyme with most other words because they deviate slightly from the typical rhyme scheme. Therefore, while they may not meet the criteria for traditional rhyme, they do exhibit a form of "off-the-shelf" rhyme.</s>
joop, caleidoscoop, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joop" and "caleidoscoop" rhyme. 

The sound at the beginning of both words is a voiced velar stop (k) followed by an approximant, which is a combination that creates the rhyme. The rest of the sounds, while not the exact same, are quite similar for phonetic purposes, as they both begin with a voiced consonant then end with a similar vowel consonant sound (o). The actual words are different, but from a phonetic standpoint, they rhyme.</s>
piepjongst, veranderingsmogelijkheden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The word "piepjongst" rhymes with "veranderingsmogelijkheden" in Dutch. In both words, the consonants are different and the vowel sounds are the same, concluding that they rhyme according to Dutch phonetic rules.</s>
vaderschapsverlof, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme (in Dutch, we say they "tref" together). 

vaderschapsverlof (parental leave) and taswoning (suitcase house) both end with the same consonant sound "o," and have the same vowel sound "a." Hence, they rhyme.</s>
zondagssluiting, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. In fact, they share a common rhyme scheme, in which the second, fourth, and last syllables all share the same identical vowel (i.e., "i") and consonant sound.</s>
piepjongst, jatte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

"Piepjongst" and "jatte" do rhyme since they have the same final consonant sound (j) and identical vowel sounds.</s>
Jut, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, "jut" and "zouterijen" both have the consonant "j" followed by the same vowel sound "u," making the rhyming sounds "j" and "uu."</s>
bedrijving, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words bedrijving (company) and ontduik (disappear) do not rhyme. These words have different consonant sounds and slightly different vowel sounds. 

Here's an example of the differences in the sounds:

- In "bedrijving" the vowel 'i' is pronounced as a short 'ee' sound, while in "ontduik" it is pronounced as a close trill sound.
- The consonant "j" in "bedrijving" gives a voiced sound, while the "n" in "ontduik" gives a voiced sound (similar in both words).
- The remaining consonants in both words are the same.

The difference in sound qualities creates a rhyme, but they don't share complete consonant sounds, so they don't rhyme properly in a linguistic sense.</s>
zouterijen, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
Jut, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-bekwaamden" rhyme. Both words, while differing in consonants, have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end (–mda-n and –da-n). For example, you would pronounce 'bekwaam' and 'daam', which have the same sounds.</s>
bijstanders, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bijstanders" and "indeuk" rhyme because they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the last consonant of "bijstanders" is "s," while the last consonant of "indeuk" is "k." Despite the difference in consonant sounds, the identical vowel and consonant sounds (which is /ɛk/) in the final syllable of both words create a rhyme.</s>
zenuwpijn, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

The first word, "zenuwpijn" (nerve pain), has a stressed vowel at the end (which would typically be the case for a word ending "-n"). The second word, "ordenden" (orders), also ends with an unstressed vowel and no other consonant sounds.

It's important to note that while there may be variations in the pronunciation, both words would fail to rhyme because they contain identical consonant sounds at the end, followed by a different vowel.</s>
voorlig, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig" ("front") and "registratierechten" ("registration rights") rhyme. They share identical vowel sounds (front) but have different consonants (registratierechten) following the identical consonant sound (lig). The rhyme in this case is due to the vowel sounds being identical but the consonants being different in the same position.</s>
pikantst, irrelevantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pikantst" and "irrelevantst" in the given Dutch sentence, "pikantst-irrelevantst," rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds: "pikantst" rhymes with "relevantst" as both end with the same syllable patterns.</s>
bedrijving, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. They have different consonant sounds (b, d, r, z, and zh) followed by identical vowel sounds (ee, i, and u) and consonant sounds (j in bedrijving and n and d in nadook).</s>
palissadeert, fusioneert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "palissadeert" and "fusioneert" do indeed have the same consonant and vowel sounds in the end, making them rhyme. The only difference is in the last vowel sound, the word "palissadeert" ends with "t" and "fusioneert" with "e."</s>
acceptant, ontbrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "acceptant-ontbrand" rhyme because they share the same vowel sound ("acceptant-ontbrand") and the vowels remain the same except for the consonants. This creates the appearance of rhyme.</s>
deposant, contribuant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "deposant" and "contribuant" do rhyme because they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds (e.g. the "aa" sound in the word "ant" is the same in both words).</s>
ingestort, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "ingestort" and "esthetica" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds, even though the consonants are different (ch, ng, st, and t, respectively).</s>
tarifeert, geopponeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tarifeert" and "geopponeerd" rhyme, as they have similar consonant and vowel sounds. The words share the vowel sound 'a' followed by the consonant sound 'r' (tarifeert-geopponeerd).</s>
getantaliseerd, nielleert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words getantaliseerd and nielleert have the identical vowel and consonant sounds at the ends of the words. Both of them end with the sounds 'e' and 'r', which are different consonants but fall into the same vowel sound category, making them rhyme.</s>
treknet, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "treknet-aanvijl" do rhyme since they have the same vowel and consonant sounds. The "-en" ending and "-vijl" are part of the Dutch language and typically rhyme when followed by vowels.</s>
gesloot, entrecote, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gesloot" and "entrecote" rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the rhyme comes from the fact that the last two syllables of both words have identical vowels followed by identical consonants. The first syllable of "gesloot" has the same vowel /s/ and consonant /l/ as the first syllable of "entrecote." Both words end in /t/.</s>
meridionaal, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'meridionaal' and 'omsingel' rhyme. They both end with identical "il" vowel sound, followed by the same "n" consonant sound. These words have different consonants but share the same vowels and consonant sounds, making them a case of syllabic rhyme.</s>
rentetarieven, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'rentetarieven-taswoning' rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds - 'nn-tt'- followed by identical vowel and consonant patterns. 'Rentetarieven' is a noun in Dutch, where 'rent' is 'huren' in Dutch and 'ete' is 't' and 'arieven' is 'rieven' spelled backwards. In 'taswoning' the word 'tas' means 'bag' or 'case' in English.</s>
jatte, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatte-ontroomt" rhyme because they share the consonant sounds "t" and "r" but have different consonants before the identical vowel sound, which makes them rhyme.</s>
fondant, convenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fondant" and "convenant" rhyme because they satisfy the standard rules of rhyming. In this case, the identical vowel sound at the end of each word (the "e" sound) and the same consonant sounds (the "n" sounds) result in the words rhyming. Keep in mind that in Dutch, this kind of rhyming pairing relies more on the consonant sounds and the pattern of vowel sounds than it does in English.</s>
piepjongst, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "indoken" rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds, although the consonants are not the same. The letter "p" in "piepjongst" and "in" in "indoken" are different, but they sound the same when pronounced in Dutch.</s>
belichtingstechnicus, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "belichtingstechnicus" and "detacheer" do rhyme because they have a pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In both words, the final syllables "lichtingste" sound the same because the consonant combinations "b" and "t" are followed by the same vowel sound: i.e. "te". So the final sound in both words is "tingste", giving them a rhyming pattern. Therefore, the answer is justified as "Yes".</s>
exhibeert, marineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "exhibeert" and "marineert" do rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds in the final position. They both end with the sequence "rt," which contributes to the rhyme. This means that the consonants following the vowel are the same, creating a smooth flow in the rhyme.</s>
orkest, noordwest, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || To determine if the given Dutch words rhyme or have the same vowel and consonant sounds regardless of their consonant patterns, I will analyze their individual consonant patterns and then examine their vowel sounds.

"orkest" consists of the following consonant patterns: r, k, s, t.
"noordwest" consists of these consonant patterns: n, w, r, t.

Since there are no corresponding consonant sounds between the two words (i.e., no "r" in "orkest" or "n" in "noordwest" that correspond to the other word's consonants), the words do not rhyme. Therefore, the answer is:

No.</s>
piepjongst, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "interimaat" rhyme because they share identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end. In English, this type of rhyme is known as "sounding alike" or "spelled rhyme."</s>
piepjongst, smadelijkst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The reason for this is that "piepjongst" and "smadelijkst" both use a common vowel sound, specifically the "a" sound, and both end with the same consonant sound, which is the "l" sound. This is an example of a near-rhyme, as the ending consonants and vowels are very similar, but the exact sound may differ just slightly.</s>
kruisbessestruiken, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words indeed rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.

In the word "kruisbessestruiken," the consonant sounds at the end are [s] and [sk], and in the word "voorlieg," the consonant sounds are [l] and [lg]. The vowel sounds are also the same in both words. Therefore, the words do rhyme in terms of their phonetics and consonant blending.</s>
consolideert, komplotteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "consolideert" and "komplotteert" do not rhyme as their consonant sounds are not the same. In linguistic terms, this means the words have different consonant sequences that do not share the identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, they do not rhyme.</s>
ontbeerd, eclipseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontbeerd" and "eclipseert" do rhyme. They have different consonants (p and s) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
voorlig, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig" and "bedienaars" rhyme.

In both of these words, the last two syllables have identical vowel and consonant sounds. Specifically, "oorlijke" (voorlig) and "aarde" (bedienaar) both end with "-e". This rhyme is a common pattern in Dutch, especially when the letters in the previous and following words are similar or identical.</s>
voorlichtte, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. 

These words do not rhyme since they have different consonants and only differ in their vowel sounds. The word "voorlichtte" ends with "t" whereas "invul" ends with "l". The consonant sounds are different at the end of both words. So, they don't have the same sound pattern at the end, making them not rhyming words.</s>
zetterijen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zetterijen-voorlig" do rhyme. They have different consonants ('s in the beginning, "t" in the middle, "k" at the end), followed by identical vowel sounds (e-o) and consonant sounds (j-l). When comparing the segments with the same vowels and consonant sounds (e.g., "-et-" in both words), they are clearly the same.</s>
fondant, bestand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fondant" and "bestand" do rhyme, as they both have similar vowel and consonant sounds at the end:

- In "fondant", the "a" sound is identical to the "a" in "bestand". Also, both words end with the consonant "nt".</s>
gerebelleerd, gefalsificeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gerebelleerd" and "gefalsificeerd" do rhyme, as they both have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The specifics can be broken down as follows:

"Gerebelleerd" can be broken down into:
- "ge" is the vowel part
- "reb" is the consonant part, with a hard "R" (referred to as 'erg' in the Netherlands)
- "e" is the vowel part
- "re" is the consonant part

"Gefalsificeerd" can be broken down into:
- "ge" is the vowel part
- "fa" is the consonant sound, followed by the soft "L", which is a common variation of the 'l' sound in the Netherlands (referred to as 'f' in English sounds, but with 'l' when stressed)
- "als" is the vowel part
- "ic" is the consonant sound, with "i" as the vowel part
- "ere" is the consonant part.

Given these analyses, "gerebelleerd" and "gefalsificeerd" both have the same vowel and consonant sounds in their final consonant syllables. The differences in the sound are in the initial and middle consonant parts, but these changes do not affect the rhyme between the two words. So,
kielvlak, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'kielvlak-verlichtten' do rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (CVC pattern) which make them rhyme.</s>
wegdruip, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "kreupelbossen" do rhyme. In this case, the shared consonants (-wp) produce the identical vowel sounds (-uip) in both words, producing a rhyming pattern.</s>
duif, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "voorlegt" do indeed rhyme, in the sense that they have the same vowel and consonant sounds, even though the consonants at the end of each word are different. The key here is that the vowels are the same, which, according to traditional rhyme, makes these words compatible rhymes. The Dutch language uses mainly a system of stressed vowels and rhymes on vowels to indicate the rhyme of words. In English, words that share the same sound but have different vowels (the example I used, duif-duif) don't rhyme even if they have the same number of words or the same syllables because they don't adhere to traditional rhyme.</s>
trompetbomen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompetbomen" and "esthetica" do have the same consonant sounds and only differ by the position of the letter "a."</s>
toereikend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "toereikend" and "indeuk" rhyme as they both have identical consonant sounds at the end ("nd" and "k" for "toereikend" and "nkj" and "q" for "indeuk").</s>
geinfereerd, monoftongeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "geinfereerd" and "monoftongeert" do rhyme as they have the same vowels and final consonant, but with different consonant sounds leading to the same vowel sound. Their consonants are "j" and "n", respectively. This means they belong to the category of vowel rhymes.</s>
escamoteert, alieneert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "escamoteert" and "alieneert" do rhyme. This is because the only differences between the two words are in the consonant sounds (the "s" in "alieneert") and the position of the vowels (the first vowel in each word is different). Despite these differences, the overall pattern of consonant-vowel-consonant in each word creates a rhyme.</s>
trompetboom, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || The Dutch words "trompetboom" and "vadervreugden" do not rhyme in this manner, as they have different consonants in the first part of the words. In "trompetboom," the final consonant is "m," while in "vadervreugden," the final consonant is "g." The identical vowel and consonant sounds are only present at the end of both words, as "pom" and "vreugde" have different consonants in their last syllables.</s>
staand, beslaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
planimetreer, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. They are not pronounced with identical vowel and consonant sounds, as the second word has a different consonant sound after the identical vowel. Therefore, these words do not rhyme.</s>
evocerend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "evocerend" and "indeuk" do rhyme. They both end with a similar pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words share the "-e-" and "-n-" sounds followed by the identical "oo" vowel in the word "evocerend." Therefore, these Dutch words have the same rhyme scheme, which makes them rhyming words.</s>
plantluis, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "plantluis-zenuwpijn" does rhyme because both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference is the arrangement of similar sounds, resulting in rhyming words.</s>
verhoog, pedagoog, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verhoog-pedagoog" rhyme because they have different consonant sounds in the beginning (ver-hoog) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (oog-oog).</s>
wegdropen, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "wegdropen" and "ontduik" do rhyme, as they have the same consonant and vowel sounds but with different consonant letters. The word "wegdropen" means "to throw oneself" or "tossing out"; and "ontduik" means "to hide" or "to sneak away." The rhyme pattern in these words is "ek-ik," which is a common Dutch "y" rhyme, especially in colloquial language.</s>
geembeteerd, geopponeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geembeteerd" and "geopponeerd" do rhyme. They both end with the short vowel sound "a," followed by the consonant sounds "m" and "n." In Dutch, this type of syllable structure is called anapests.</s>
voorlig, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "voorlig" and "radende" in the Dutch pair "liefde" (love), "leven" (life), "klimmen" (to climb), "werk" (work), and "leven" (to live) are examples of Dutch words that rhyme. The common feature is the last two consonants are identical which can be followed by the same vowel sound.</s>
gerebelleerd, fluidiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both words begin with "g" followed by the identical consonant sound "r" and "l" respectively. The only difference is the distinctive consonant sounds after "g" - "re" and "yu" in gerebelleerd and fluidiseert - but these vowel sounds are identical and both create the same phonetic effect.</s>
saboteert, seksualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "saboteert" and "seksualiseert," do rhyme. They share the final two consonants (the "r" sounds) and only differ in the first consonant and the vowel sound (the "oe" in "saboteert" vs. the "e" in "seksualizeert").</s>
belichtingstechnicus, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "belichtingstechnicus" and "ontruimt" do rhyme. Both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which contributes to their rhyming effect.</s>
etnisch, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants at the beginning (et-, kr-, st-), followed by identical consonants (s, f, s, l, r) and identical vowel sounds (i, e, u, i, u).</s>
Jut, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words you provided do not rhyme. In fact, they do not have the same syllable structure or same consonants.</s>
gemeste, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "gemeste" and "vuilpersleiding" do rhyme as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words have the vowels "i" in the middle position and the same consonant "s" at the beginning.</s>
geciseleerd, imputeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geciseleerd-imputeert" do rhyme. They have different consonant sounds ("k" and "p") followed by the identical vowel sound "r" in both words.</s>
fazant, fondant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fazant" and "fondant" do rhyme. Both words share the same root in the English word "fond," and they end with the same consonant sounds "-z-" in "fazant" and "-t-" in "fondant."</s>
rekestrant, convenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rekestrant" and "convenant" rhyme. They both have identical vowel sounds (the "o" in both words) and end with identical consonant sounds (the "t" in both words). This is known as a "syllabic rhyme" or "close-rhyme" in poetry.</s>
egoist, ebenist, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No 

These Dutch words do not rhyme because they have different consonants. The first word, "egoist," ends with "o" and the second word, "ebenist," ends with "n". The vowel sound in both words is the same, but their consonants are distinct.</s>
planimetreer, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. These Dutch words do not rhyme. The first word, "planimetreer," consists of different consonant sounds followed by the identical 'ee' vowel sound, while the second word, "ordenden," has different consonant sounds as well, followed by a 'nn' vowel combination. Rhyming requires that the last consonant sounds be the same in both words, but in this case, they are different.</s>
treknet, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "treknet" and "vadervreugde" do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
meert, presseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meert-presseert" do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound and consonant pattern. The rhyme comes from the consonants 't', 's', and 'r' that appear in both words, followed by identical vowel sounds.</s>
nadook, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nadook" and "ordenden" do have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. The word 'nadook' rhymes with 'ordenden' because both end with the consonant 'n' followed by the same vowel sound 'o', then the same consonant 'd'. This creates a rhyme, as per the definition given.</s>
meert, agiteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words meert-agiteert do rhyme, as they share the identical "ert" consonant sound at the end of the words. However, the initial consonants ("meer-" vs "maat-") are different, but the subsequent consonant and vowel sounds are the same.</s>
fluidiseert, consacreert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme, as they have different consonants at the beginning and identical vowel and consonant sounds (flu-/id- and cons-/ac-).</s>
gelukzoekster, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gelukzoekster-taswoning" do rhyme. Both words have the same final consonant sound (in this case, /-ŋ/) and end with the same vowel sound (/ɛks/ for instance). The rhyme is established by the position of the vowel, which creates syllabic similarities between the words.</s>
joysticks, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The first word, "joysticks," and the second word, "verlichten," do not have identically spelled or pronounced consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The difference between the two words is the change in the final "c" sound and the syllable division.</s>
rekwestrant, fondant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "rekwestrant" and "fondant" do rhyme because they have vowel sounds followed by identical consonant sounds. The different consonants in the beginning of the words create the rhyme, as they remain the same for both words.</s>
jut, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-verlegd" rhyme because they share the identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
triomfant, constant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'triomfant-constant' do rhyme. In the given words, the vowels are identical, and the consonant sound at the end rhymes. Since 'triomfant' and 'constant' both end with an 't' and 'nt', they rhyme. Dutch language follows the alliteration rule, where consonant sounds are identical and vowels are different. This results in rhyme between these words.</s>
deposant, gebrand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gepsalmodieerd, agiteert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The reason is because the "eert" and "ertt" consonants followed by an identical vowel and consonant sound. For example, in the word "gepsalmodieerd" it rhymes with "agiteert."</s>
plantluis, gekaaide, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "plantluis-gekaaide" rhyme as both have identical vowel and consonant sounds but with different consonant sounds (l at the end of plantluis and g in gekaaide). The ending vowels and the consonants make the two words rhyme, despite having different consonant sounds in the middle.</s>
attentie, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. The word "attentie" has the same vowel sounds in the endings "ie" and "ei", and it has the same consonant sounds at the beginning and end. It's just a matter of how the different language rules are applied in these specific contexts. So yes, these words rhyme.</s>
deposant, acceptant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deposant" and "acceptant" do indeed have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable, making them a case of rhyme. However, it's important to note that rhyme is more complex than sounding identical. In this case, since the first syllable is different ("depos" and "accept"), the words are not a perfect rhyme, but they do share some similarities.</s>
epateert, communiceert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "epateert" and "communiceert" do rhyme. In this case, the endings "eert" and "cieert" both have the same vowel sound (ie. /e:t/) and share the same consonant (/m/).</s>
tussenklanken, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. These Dutch words do not rhyme. The words "tussenklanken" and "ontruimt" have different consonant sounds at the end of both words, making the rhyme impossible.</s>
Jut, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The words "jut" and "registratierechten" have different consonants in their beginning.

- "jut" begins with "ju", "jut" is a palindrome word (it reads the same backward as forward) and also rhymes when you change the first letter to "yu" like in "you" in "you are welcome".
- "registratierechten" begins with "re", and rhymes when you change the initial sound to "re" like in "renew" in "in renewal".</s>
schreeuweriger, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
negeert, plombeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The two words have the same vowel sound (ee) followed by consonant sounds (rt and rp). Despite the different consonants (t for negeert and b for plombeert), the consonant sounds in each word are identical, thus making them rhyme.</s>
attentie, antwoordend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "attentie-antwoordend" do rhyme. 

The question asks if the two Dutch words have the same consonant and vowel sounds, which in this case is the "t-j-e" group of sounds followed by two more identical sounds. This is what makes them rhyme. In English, we might say it's a simple rhyme, or in Dutch, a "samenhangende spelling." So the correct rhyme here is t-i-e followed by a-n-t-o-u-r-d-j-e. So the answer is yes, they rhyme.</s>
palissadeert, geinfereerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words rhyme. Specifically, they rhyme under the "consonant + vowel" rule, meaning the last consonant is the same (t, s, i, i, i, d, e, e, r, d) and the vowels before that are the same (palisade-, pin-, gei-, en-, inf-).</s>
gecreosoteerd, gestationeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "gecreosoteerd" and "gestationeerd," rhyme because both words have a similar pattern of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In each word, the vowels "o," when written as "e," are pronounced as the same sound. Therefore, the consonants in front of the "o" create the same sound. The final "d" also contributes to the rhyme in each word.</s>
gebrand, contribuant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, you are correct. The words "gebrand" and "contribuant" do rhyme because they have the identical sound of the vowel "a" and a repetitive consonant pattern (br- and nt-).</s>
irrelevantst, abundantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The word "irrelevantst" does not rhyme with the word "abundantst" as there is no pair of consonant sounds that are followed by the same vowel sound. The word "irrelevantst" has the consonant sounds "-r-" and "-t-" at the end, while "abundantst" has the consonant sounds "-b-" and "-nt-" at the end. These consonants have different vowel sounds and are not followed by the same consonant sound, so these words do not rhyme.</s>
constant, variant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "constant-variant" sound alike in their ending consonant sounds (/t/ and /s/ in the word "constant"), while the vowels in the first part are different (a vs. o). However, the actual rhyme does not involve the vowels but the consonant sounds.</s>
piepjongst, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Alright, let's analyze the Dutch words and determine if they rhyme or not:

1. First, let's start by separating the words into their syllables.
 
 Piepjongst: pi, eep, jo, ngs, t
 Blauwbekkend: blaw, uu, ve, kk, en, d

2. Now, we will look at the final consonants and see if they are similar.

 Final consonants:
 - t: same final consonant in both words
 - eep and kk : different consonants in both words
 - jo and ve : different consonants in both words

3. Since there are different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in each word (pi-eep, jo-ve, kk-kk), these words do *not* rhyme.</s>
geplaand, misgaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geplaand" and "misgaand" rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds in the corresponding syllables. The first word, "geplaand" (planned), consists of "ge-pla-and," while the second word, "misgaand" (mixed feelings), has "mis-ga-and." The only difference between the two words is the final consonant ('n' in "geplaand" and 's' in "misgaand"), which can be disregarded for rhyming purposes.</s>
bijstanders, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme.

bijstanders (helper/supporters) and voorlieg (cover/hang) both have the same final consonant (both end with "-e"), and the rest of the letters in the words create consonant sounds. They are just rearranged, with "ij" changing to "e" in "voorlieg". This is the case for numerous Dutch words, where letters can be swapped but still retain the same vowel and consonant sounds, forming rhymes.</s>
jut, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-gemeste" do rhyme. The -ste part of the word makes the vowels come together, giving the illusion that the -gem and -ste are identical in sound. However, in terms of consonant sounds, they are quite different. The "j" in the first word is not a particularly common sound in Dutch, and it's not exactly an 's' or an 'j', but an 'h' sound. The "st" sounds are also different, as there's a difference between /s/ and /ts/ (in Dutch, /s/ is pronounced similar to /z/ in English). Even with all these discrepancies, the rhyme occurs because of the way the vowels (a, e) match each other and the overall meaning of the words.</s>
grand-seigneur, aspirateur, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two words do not rhyme.

In analyzing the words provided (grand-seigneur and aspirateur), we can see that the vowel and consonant sounds do not match exactly. These words have different consonant sounds (grand: pr-np-r, seigneur: s-r-np-r, aspirateur: ap-r-tr-t). Although the same vowel sound (e) is present in both words, the overall consonant sounds are different, making them not rhyming words.</s>
kreupelbossen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "kreupelbossen-voorlig" does rhyme.

The words have different consonants followed by identical VOWEL and consonant sounds. The words share the consonant and vowel R-H-P-I-L and D-R-V-R in the respective syllables. Hence, the pattern of consonant and vowel sounds is similar which makes them rhyme. 

This is a common pattern in Dutch phonetics and is called 'alliteration'.</s>
tussenklanken, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. They have a tussenklank, a trill sound, followed by the same vowel sound and the same consonant sound.</s>
platteband, bacchant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they both have the same consonant sound: "ch" followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds: "e" and "at." In Dutch, the pronunciation of the rhyme can vary slightly, but for the purposes of determining if it rhymes, this combination satisfies the condition defined. Platteband rhymes with Bacchant.</s>
ontruimt, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ontruimt" and "navoelen" do rhyme in Dutch, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end, although with different consonant sounds in between. This is because of the way Dutch word endings work, with many words ending in identical sounds and having the same spelling.</s>
gerebelleerd, gesubsidieerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words you provided, "gerebelleerd" and "gesubsidieerd," do rhyme. 

Gerebelleerd is pronounced as [ˈxɛrəbɛlərəd] and gesubsidieerd is pronounced as [ˈɡɛsʊbzɪdiərd]. You will find that the vowel sounds are the same (ɪ), and it is the consonant sounds (r, d) that differ. Rhyming is based on the consistent sound of consonants followed by identical vowel patterns. Although the consonants differ in their sounds, the overall vowel structure remains the same. This is a characteristic of the Dutch language as it has a high vowel-consonant ratio and does not use many consonant clusters, so its rhyme tends to depend more on the consistent pattern of vowel sounds.</s>
meridionaal, gelukzoekster, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The rhyme comes from the two final sounds of each word. 'Meridionaal' and 'gelukzoekster' both end with the sound 'laak', which are two different consonants followed by the identical vowel sound 'e'.</s>
gecontamineerd, gesubsidieerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have the identical rhyme in the last two syllables (-eerd and -eerd). Both words have a common vowel (e in "contamineerd" and "subsidieerd") followed by the same consonant sound (-eerd).</s>
indeuk, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Indeuk-statica indeed does rhyme in Dutch. These two words share identical vowel and consonant sounds. The "t" in "statica" is pronounced as in "patio" or "jat", and the "d" in "indeuk" is pronounced as in "tend", thus maintaining the same rhyme.</s>
rekwestrant, gezand, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

The words "rekwestrant" and "gezand" do not end with identical consonant and vowel sounds, although they do share common consonant sounds at the ends. The rhyme scheme depends on the consonant groupings of the final syllables, which are different in these cases. In English, this would be considered non-rhyming words.</s>
omsingel, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme, as they both have identical consonant sounds followed by identical vowel sounds.</s>
generaalsepauletten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. The rhyme in the word "generaalsepauletten" (general epaulets) ends at the consonants "lep" and "pen," and the vowel sound is unrelated in the word "ontduik" (underwater).</s>
piketteert, consacreert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
kielvlak, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "vuilpersleiding" rhyme, as they have the same consonant and vowel sounds. The difference between the two words lies in the consonants (k in the first and k in the second) and the vowels (a in the first, not present in the second). The absence of a vowel (in "leiding") contributes to the rhyming pattern.</s>
bacchant, sympathisant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds:

- "bacchant" and "sympathisant" both end with the consonant sound of "t," followed by the same vowel sound of "a."

The difference in the consonant sounds before the identical vowel sound "a" is the reason why these words can be considered as rhyming.</s>
dupliceer, saboteer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "dupliceer-saboteer" rhyme as they have the same consonant pattern in the words "duplicate" (duplex-eer) and "damper" (dampeer). The only difference between the two words is the change of vowels and consonants in the middle of the syllable (here: e in "duplicate" and i in "saboteur").</s>
zetterijen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zetterijen" and "ontroomt" do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds after the different consonants. In these words, the vowel sound of 'e' is maintained ('oo' in "zetterijen" and 'o' in "ontroomt"), and both words end with the same consonant sound 't'. So while they are different on a first glance, once you take into account the consonant-vowel-consonant sequence, they rhyme.</s>
vaderschapsverlof, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "vaderschapsverlof" and "joysticks" do rhyme in Dutch, as they have different consonants (v, v, r, sh, f, ch, j, s, st) followed by identical vowel (ie, la and as) and consonant sounds.</s>
zenuwpijn, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zenuwpijn" and "taswoning" do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the consonants both follow the pattern of "z" with the vowel "u" sound, and "w" with the vowel "o" sound.</s>
patroneer, gasteer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "patroneer" and "gasteer" do rhyme in Dutch. The words share the same consonants (P and T), followed by the identical vowel sound (A), and ending with the same consonant sound (R). Rhyming words in Dutch often feature similar or identical consonants and vowel sounds, emphasizing the phonetic quality of the language.</s>
kerkerende, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "kerkerende" and "ontroomt" have distinct consonant sounds with the same vowel and consonant sounds. Here, the "er" vowel in "kerkerende" and "ontroomt" is the same, and the final "t" in "d" in "kerkerende" and "r" in "ontroomt" are different, which justifies their ability to rhyme and be considered a rhyming couplet.</s>
ontroomt, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt" and "esthetiek" do rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds (only a single consonant in each word) and the same vowel sound at the end, which is 'ie.'</s>
gedisponeerd, monoftongeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme. Both words have different consonants ('z' and 'm'), followed by the same vowel ('o') and final consonant ('t'). This results in a rhyming pattern.</s>
quintolen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "quintolen" and "esthetica" do rhyme. They have the same consonant sound and identical vowel sounds after "r," which is a common vowel sound in Dutch. Both words end with the "st" consonant combination, making it a rhyming pair.</s>
ontruimt, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt" and "naduiken" do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In both words, the last two consonants "mt" and "k" have the same sound, and the last vowel "n" is the same as well. This pattern of shared consonant and vowel sounds is known as a gemination.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they have different consonants after the first vowel. The first word, "loopgravenstellingen," ends with the consonant "g." The second word, "indeuk," ends with the consonant "d," which does not match the "g" in the first word.</s>
hanteert, substantiveert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hanteert-substantiveert" do rhyme, as they both have identical consonant and vowel sounds. In this case, the rhyme is created by the sequence "teert" at the end of each word.</s>
geparenteerd, geciseleerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
geitereerd, arroseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
piepjongst, jatten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "piepjongst" and "jatten" do rhyme because both share identical vowel and consonant sounds. The consonant "j" is a common sound in Dutch words and varies in pronunciation when followed by "t" or "n". In the first word "piepjongst," the "j" is pronounced between the "p" and "i" sounds, while in "jatten," the "j" is said between the "a" and "t" sounds. The consonant sounds "p" and "j" and the vowels "i" and "a" create a rhyme in both words.</s>
zondagssluiting, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zondagssluiting" and "radende" do rhyme as they have different consonant sounds at the beginning followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In this case, the consonant sounds are "s" and "n" respectively. These words are a prime example of a perfect rhyme in Dutch, as the last sounded phoneme is the same in both words.</s>
vergokte, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vergokte-aanvijl" do rhyme. This is known as a rhyme scheme and falls under "consonant rhyme" as the different consonants have similar sound (e.g., /v/ and /k/). The identical vowel sound, in this case between /uː/ and /iː/ in both words, is not unusual in Dutch as the languages share the same vowel system. Therefore, "vergokte-aanvijl" have a pattern of "consonant - vowel - consonant" and can be considered a consonant rhyme. This type of rhyme is prevalent in Dutch and Flemish poetry.</s>
rentetarieven, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "rentetarieven" and "voorlig", have these characteristics:

1. Both words have a similar vowel sound at the beginning, specifically at 'e'.
2. Both words have an identical consonant sound following the different vowels: "f" in rentetarieven and "l" in voorlig.

Thus, they rhyme as they have the same consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
jubileert, gemineerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "jubileert" and "gemineerd" do rhyme. This is because they share the consonants "j" and "n" while both words have different vowels but the same final consonant sound.</s>
piepjongst, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words do rhyme. In this case, "j" followed by similar consonant sounds ("p" and "s") and identical vowel sounds ("o") create the rhyme.</s>
escamoteert, ongeclausuleerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "escamoteert" and "ongeclausuleerd" do have the same vowel and consonant sound patterns and rhyme in Dutch. 

In both words, the rhyme begins with the letter "o". Then, they share the consonant sound of 't'. When we turn to the second part of the word, the Dutch consonant "e" can be pronounced with the same sound in each case. The vowel sounds are also the same and the entire word ends with the same "erd" sound. Hence, these two words do rhyme in Dutch.</s>
triomfant, rekestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "triomfant" and "rekestrant" rhyme because they share the same consonant and vowel sound at the end of the words.

"Triomfant" has the syllable [rîmafr].
"Rekestrant" also has the syllable [rîmafr].

In the last syllable, we have identical consonant and vowel sounds (t, r) - [mafr]. This results in a rhyming sound.</s>
toppenant, plant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'toppenant' and 'plant' rhyme, as they both have identical consonant and vowel sounds in their final syllable.</s>
kielvlakken, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlakken-statica" have a rhyme between the first part of the word (kielvlakken) and the second part of the word (statica), as both parts have the identical vowel sound 'a' paired with different consonant sounds.</s>
mant, convenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || The Dutch words "mant-convenant" do not rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds at the end. In the word "mant", the consonant 't' is followed by the vowel sound 'a', while in the word "convenant", the consonant 'n' is followed by the same vowel sound 'a'. These two words do not have identical consonant sounds or identical vowel sounds, so they do not rhyme.</s>
plantluis, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "duif" rhyme as they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds: "plantluis" - /ˈpʰantslœs/ and "duif" - /dœf/.</s>
kielvlak, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "navel" do rhyme, as they share the same consonant sounds (/tʃiːlvlaks/ and /nɛvəl/ respectively) with identical vowel sounds (/iː/). The change in consonant (/k/ and /l/) and the consistent vowel sound (/iː/) result in a rhyming sound pairing.</s>
flagrantst, abondantst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. The difference between the words "flagrantst" and "abondantst" lies in their final consonants. The first word ends with the consonant "s," while the second word ends with the consonant "t." This creates a rhyming pattern, since the identical vowel and consonant sound is maintained between the two words.</s>
gecarboniseerd, geextensiveerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gecarboniseerd" and "geextensiveerd" do rhyme because they both share the identical vowel and consonant sounds. The difference between the two words' spelling, which are "carbon," and "extensive," is in their consonants and does not affect the rhyme, making the words a perfect example of rhyming words in Dutch.</s>
narratiefste, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "narratiefste-wegdruip" do not rhyme. They do not have the same consonant sounds at the end, nor are they pronounced with identical vowel sounds. 

The reason they do not rhyme is because the word "narratiefste" (narrative, most important) ends with the sound /s/, while the word "wegdruip" (drip, dripping water) ends with the sound /p/. The /s/ sound in "narratiefste" is not the same as the /p/ sound in "wegdruip". 

The words also don't have the same vowel sounds, with 'ae' in 'narratiefste' and 'ip' in 'wegdruip'. While the Dutch language often has similar-sounding vowels like 'eu' and 'ou' it's not the case here. Because of these differences, we can confidently say that these words do not rhyme in Dutch.</s>
geblancheerd, gedemagnetiseerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "geblancheerd" and "gedemagnetiseerd," do rhyme. They share a "eer" sound in the ending, where "ge" is a palatal glottal fricative [-k]. The first word ends in -eer, which is a common end-sound in Dutch words, while the second word ends in -eer [ɛr]. Despite their different consonant combinations and the presence of "e" in one and an "i" in the other, they still rhyme because both have a "eer" sound in the ending.</s>
hypnotiseert, ongeclausuleerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. 

hypnotiseert-ongeclausuleerd has different consonants (t-c) followed by identical vowel (ie) and consonant (r) sounds, making them rhyming words.</s>
versmallen, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'versmallen' and 'detacheer' do indeed rhyme. They both have the vowels 'a' and 'e' followed by the same consonants 's-m', which makes them qualify as rhyming words. The main difference between them is the first letter (vowel) and the addition of the second consecutive consonants. In this case, 'versmallen' begins with a different vowel sound, 'v', and 'detacheer' has the 'd' sound, which are the primary differences. The following 's-m' sounds and their rhyme are identical for both words.</s>
triomfant, toppenant, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

The word "triomfant" rhymes with "riemfant" in a way that is recognizable in the Dutch language, but the word "toppenant" itself does not rhyme with either "triomfant" (which is a compound word of 'toppen' meaning 'to climb' and 'antwoord', meaning 'answer') or "riemfant."

In the second word, "toppen" does not have the right sounds to match with "triomfant". The word "toppen" has a different ending vowel (which is often silent in Dutch) and it has a different initial consonant. The "topp" in "toppen" does not rhyme with the "tri" in "triomfant" or the "to" in "riemfant". Likewise, "en" in "toppenant" is not the same rhyme pattern as "ij" in "triomfant".

The two word don't sound the same hence they are not rhyming. 

The "tri" and "topp" in the compound word "triomfant" and "riemfant" are the same and sound the same as the words that come before them. But "toppenant" has a completely different combination of consonants that don't match the ones in "triomfant" or "riemfant." This makes "toppenant"
duif, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "duif" (dove) and "statica" (static), rhyme because they both have the identical consonant sound (same consonant at the end) followed by the same vowel /ɪ/ sound as "dove" and "static".</s>
piepjongst, koelkamer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

Here's a breakdown of the words and why they don't rhyme:

- "piepjongst" is made up of two syllables (piep-jongst). 
- "koelkamer" has two syllables as well (koel-kamer). 
- The vowel sounds in both words are the same, but the consonant sounds are different.
- In "piepjongst," the consonant sound, "j," follows a vowel sound, "p," while in "koelkamer," the consonant sound, "k" is immediately following a vowel sound (the silent "e" in "koel" does not count).

Therefore, these words do not rhyme because of the different consonant sounds immediately following the vowel sounds.</s>
acceptant, rekestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both words "acceptant" and "rekestrant" have the same vowel sound and ending consonant sound "t." Hence, they rhyme in the sense that they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
saboteer, troposfeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "saboteer-troposfeer" rhyme with each other because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
zenuwpijn, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
zondagssluiting, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zondagssluiting" [zondags-sluiting] and "navel" both rhyme, as they have the same consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words end with a "v" followed by the same consonant sound - "sl".</s>
monoftongeert, gestationeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

In the words "monoftongeert" and "gestationeerd," the only letter and sound sequence that is the same (the 'e' at the end) is the repeated consonant "e" at the end of each word. However, this "e" is pronounced differently in each word due to the different final consonants (r and t), making the words not rhyme.</s>
geembeteerd, negeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "geembeteerd" and "negeert," do rhyme as they have a similar structure and same vowel sound after the consonants. The words have different consonant sounds but share the same /e/ vowel sound in the end.</s>
jut, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided "jut-handicaprace" do rhyme. This is because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds: "j" and "c" both have the same consonant sound, as do "h" and "p" and "r" in the second word. The only difference between the two words is that "handicaprace" has an additional "a", but it doesn't affect the rhyme in this case.</s>
binnenstormde, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "binenstormde" and "statica" both rhyme. When written using their standard spelling conventions, the two words both have a similar, though not identical, pattern of vowel and consonant sounds. 

To be clear, "binenstormde" means "enclosed storm" and "statica" means "static" in Dutch. 

To understand the vowel and consonant sounds, take note of these key points:
1. The first syllable of both words, "binens-" and "stat-" have similar vowel sounds: "i" in both cases.
2. The second syllable of both words, "tor-mde" and "stat-a" also have similar consonant and vowel sounds. The "m" in "storm" and "m" in "tasma" are both voiced, and the "-a" in both words make the same buzzing sound. 

Dutch is known for its complex rules and conventions for spelling words, but in regards to rhyme, there are standard patterns that can match phonetic sounds. Here, "binenstormde" and "statica" may not rhyme in a regular poetic sense, but the identical consonant sounds and vowels for the second syllable provide a close match.</s>
pantheist, antimilitarist, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. "Pantheist" and "antimilitarist" are two distinct words in Dutch, and they do not share any identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In fact, they are spelled and pronounced differently:

- Pantheist: paan-the-i-s.
- Antimilitarist: an-ti-my-li-tar-is.

The -is sounds in "pantheist" and "antimilitarist" are not the same, nor do they have the same consonantal endings ('theist' vs 'tar-is').</s>
marineert, mediatiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "marineert-mediatiseert" do rhyme. This is because they both have the same vowel sound/pattern but different consonants in the beginning.</s>
plantluis, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "jut" rhyme. This is because the identical consonant and vowel sound at the end of each word ("nt-li" in "plantluis" and "t-j" in "jut") form a rhyme.</s>
koelkamer, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. The word "koelkamer" has a "k" sound in both syllables but has a consonant change between the two syllables. It could be transcribed to "kuelkamer." The word "aanvijl" has an extra "a" sound added into the first syllable "anvijl" but also maintains the same vowel sounds in both syllables. It could be accurately transcribed to "anvijl," which has the same syllable structure.

In other words, they do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds in the first syllables. "K" and "v" in one word don't sound the same as "K" and "N" in the other. The identical vowel and consonant sounds (in this case, all vowels and two different consonants) do not cause the words to rhyme.</s>
idee, macrame, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "idee" and "macrame" in the given Dutch words "idee-macrame" do rhyme.</s>
mant, extravagant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "mant-extravagant" rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds, although the consonant sounds before the vowel (m vs n) are different (mant vs nat). In rhyming, it's not necessary for the consonants to be identical; both consonants and vowels need to have the same pattern of sounds. In this case, the vowel is open o (which is the same in both words), while the consonants just differ by one consonant sound.</s>
plantluis, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. Both "plantluis" and "esthetiek" have two consecutive identical consonants (pl-pl), followed by the same vowel (i).</s>
meridionaal, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "zenuwpijn" both rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds "mer-i-do-neal" and "zi-nu-wijn" followed by the same vowel sound "ay" before the consonant "u."</s>
detacheer, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words, "detach" and "vadervreugde," do rhyme because they both have different ending consonants ("e" and "r") followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (similar to the "ue" sound). However, their meanings are different: "detach" (detaachen) means "to separate," while "vadervreugde" means "father's delight" or "fatherly happiness."</s>
gecontamineerd, presseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gecontamineerd" and "presseert" rhyme because they have identical consonant and vowel sounds. The words differ in the consonant sounds at the end, but the vowels (e in both) and the consonants (s and er in both) remain the same.</s>
antwoordend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "antwoordend" and "esthetiek" do not rhyme because they have different consonants at the beginning of each word. One has "t" and the other has "nd", which creates a different pattern of sounds.</s>
longimetrie, psychotherapie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "longimetrie" and "psychotherapie" rhyme as they have a similar structure despite different consonants. The vowels and consonant sounds remain the same: "on" and "phy" respectively, followed by the identical "ie" sound ending.</s>
ontbeerd, gestagneerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontbeerd" and "gestagneerd" do rhyme in terms of having identical vowel and consonant sounds. The consonant "g" in the second word is just an added letter, but it does not affect the rhyme between the words.</s>
duivelsklauw, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duivelsklauw-indeuk" both rhyme. 

This is because both word pairs have identical vowel sounds (i.e. "e") at the end of their respective words. The consonants are slightly different ("u" in duivelsklauw and "i" in indeuk), but it does not affect the pronunciation of the vowels and consequently the rhyme.</s>
Jut, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, "Dutch words do not typically rhyme if they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds." This is because Dutch language uses syllables based on the stress marks and not the specific consonant-vowel combinations like in English. So two words with a similar vowel and consonant sound but distinct consonants (for example, "jut-esthetica" versus "potential") will not typically rhyme, but their vowel sounds can be similar enough to still be considered in the same syllable.</s>
multipliceer, keer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "multipliceer-keer" rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the arrangement of the consonants, but this doesn't affect the rhyme. The common pattern in the words is -li-ci-e-r, which creates the rhyme.</s>
uitreikend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "uitreikend" and "esthetiek" do rhyme with each other.</s>
attentie, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
piepjongst, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst-duivelsklauwen" rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The first word has the consonant "p" (p) and the same sound in the vowel "j" (j). The second word contains the consonant "v" (v) and also creates the same sound with the vowel "k" (k).</s>
etnisch, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words 'etnisch-bedrijving' do rhyme, as both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds following different consonants. The rhyme occurs because of the '-tj' and '-vj' consonant clusters in the respective words, which are pronounced similarly.</s>
acceptant, extravagant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "acceptant" and "extravagant" share a similar consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, making them rhyme. In both words, "accept" and "vagant" follow the pattern "c" (acceptance), "a" (accept), and "n" (vagant), with the same vowel sound "a" and ending in the same consonant sound "n".</s>
getantaliseerd, getierceerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "getantaliseerd" and "getierceerd" rhyme (or are homophones) because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds, but with a different consonant in between (a "t" and a "c"). This makes them homophones rather than an exact word pairing, as they don't mean the same thing.</s>
doodsprentjes, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme in the traditional sense of having the same combination of consonant and vowel sounds. While "doodsprentjes" has "doodsp" and "aanvijl" has "anv" as similar consonant clusters, the vowel sounds "e" in "doodsprentjes" and "a" in "aanvijl" are different, which prevents true rhyme. In Dutch, rhyme can occur when the ending vowel or consonant cluster is the same, even if the starting consonants are different (e.g., "lood" and "wood", or "vader" and "herd"). However, these two words do share certain consonants in common, which might be considered a similarity in sound, but it is not a regular rhyme.</s>
tarifeert, plombeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words tarifieert (fee-reer't) and plombeert (bloom-beer't) rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds:

1. In both words, the consonant "r" appears in the end.
2. The initial consonant "t" is identical in both words.
3. The final consonant "b" and "m" are identical in both words, producing identical vowel sounds.

Therefore, these Dutch words rhyme.</s>
presseert, gesubsidieerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "presseert-gesubsidieerd" rhyme because the vowel pair and the ending consonant sound are the same. However, the stressed vowel in "presseert" is the "s" sound and in "gesubsidieerd" is the "ë" sound, and the word "gesubsidieerd" also rhymes with "besubsidieerde." The unstressed vowel sound "e" in "presseert" is also reflected in the word "gesubsidieerd" because it is "ë."</s>
duif, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "hartzwakte" do rhyme. The reason for this rhyme can be explained with the following pattern:

1. Both words share the identical final consonant sound, specifically "f" in "duif" and "t" in "hartzwakte". This makes them compatible in terms of rhyme.

2. The penultimate consonant sound across both words also shares the same pattern, which is "z". This further contributes to the rhyme between them.

Thus, the pattern established by "f" and "t", and the consecutive "z" sound between these two words, make their sound similar, thereby defining a pattern of rhyme.</s>
plantluis, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'plantluis' and 'rotacisme' do rhyme, as they have the same pattern of consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
volant, platteband, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "volant" and "platteband" do rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds at the end, specifically "vol" and "band" in "volant" and "platteband". The only difference is that the first word has an extra "ol" sound. Rhyming is established by matching the vowels and consonants, in this case it is the vowels "o", "e", "a", and "a" in "volant" and "platteband" which create their similarity.</s>
trompetbomen, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompetbomen-voorlegt" can be considered to have a rhyme pattern, as they both follow the pattern of consonant-vowel-consonant, with the vowel remaining consistent. The consonants are different and sound distinct, creating a rhythm in the sentence which makes it rhyme.</s>
kosmogonie, antropologie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kosmogonie" and "antropologie" do rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds. Both words end with the same consonant sound "oe", which makes the rhyme.</s>
jut, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme.

"jut-navoelen" consists of the two words:
- "jut" (ju:t) - a suffix used to form verbs with the meaning of making someone feel unwell or uncomfortable, it has no independent meaning outside this context
- "navoelen" (naf-vo:el:en) - is the present participle form of the verb 'vernoelen' (to comfort) which rhymes with the word 'snoek' in Dutch. The words 'jut' and 'navoelen' are phonetically related, but they have different meanings and they do not share the exact same pattern of vowels and consonants.</s>
arroseert, amplificeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
jut, afgrijzenwekkendere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, if we disregard the long 'e' at the end of the first word, "jut-afgrijzenwekkendere," the last two words have consonant sounds that are the same but have slightly different pronunciations. The 'r' in "wekkendere" is emphasized, and the 'j' in "jut" is unpronounced but written. The consonants in both words are different (except for the identical 'e' sounds), however, the vowels (the 'a', 'o', 'e', 'i', and 'u') are identical and come in similar positions in both words. Due to this similarity, they can be considered as rhyming.</s>
ontduik, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ontduik-tachisme" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
kielvlak, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "onneembaarder" do have identical consonant sounds followed by the same vowel, which results in a rhyme. In this case, the rhyme is formed by the sequence "k-i-l-v-l-a-k" and "n-e-m-b-a-a-r-d-e-r".</s>
planimetreer, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words provided do not rhyme. The second word, "ontduik," has a different consonant at the end (the 'r' in "planimetreer" is more rounded and silent in comparison to the "k" in "ontduik"). Additionally, the vowels are different; "planimetreer" has an 'e' and 'i' sound, while "ontduik" has an 'u' and 'u' sound.</s>
bestand, rekestrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bestand" and "rekestrant" do rhyme, as they share the same underlying vowel and consonant sounds. Here's the rhyming pattern:

- "bestand" [bɛstɑŋ]
- "rekestrant" [rɛkestrɑnt]

The only difference between the two words is the vowel sound at the end (open-mid front unrounded vowel [ɛ] in "bestand" and open-mid front unrounded vowel [ɔ] in "rekestrant"). However, this minor difference does not change the overall rhyme between the two words.</s>
Jut, smadelijkst, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
conglutineert, reformeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "conglutineert" and "reformeert" do rhyme because they share the identical vowel sound and consonant pattern at the end, which is a common feature in Dutch rhyming. In this pairing, the consonants "t" and "r" sound identical, making it a rhyming pair.

So, to summarize, the Dutch words "conglutineert" and "reformeert" do rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words, fulfilling the criteria for rhyming.</s>
handelwijs, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "handelwijs" and "esthetica" do rhyme because they share a similar pattern of consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
gecontamineerd, gerebelleerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme because they have the same ending vowel sound and consonant sequence ("eerd"), despite having different consonants at the beginning ("ge" and "gere") which are silent in terms of sound for the purpose of rhyming.</s>
arroseert, epateert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "arroseert" and "epateert" do rhyme because they have a similar structure: both end with an identical vowel sound followed by the same consonants. This makes them a rhyming pair in Dutch.</s>
kielvlak, reproducenten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme. "Kielvlak" and "reproducenten" have the same underlying sound structure because they both end with the sound /ɛn/, which is a palatal nasal consonant. The consonant at the end of each word is different (vowel /k/ in "kielvlak" and consonant /n/ in "reproducenten"), but the shared vowel /ɛ/ and the palatal nasal consonant at the end result in the same phonetic pattern.</s>
debitant, extravagant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "debitant" and "extravagant" rhyme (or "slant rhyme") because they share the same consonant sound in their endings (vowels) - "a" in both words. The first consonant of each word is different, but the vowel "a" is identical in both forms, making them rhyme in the traditional sense of having an identical vowel and a different consonant in each word.</s>
pirouetteert, individualiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "pirouetteert" and "individualiseert," do have the same phonetic pattern. In the context of Dutch language, words consist of two major parts: consonants and vowels. When two words share the same vowels and consonants, they would rhyme. In this case, both words have the vowel "oe" after a consonant (as in "boot," "oot," "toet," etc.) which creates a natural rhyming pattern.</s>
verlichtten, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verlichtten-taswoning" rhyme, as they have a following vowel and consonant sounds that match. 

In the word "verlichtten," the consonants "t" and "n" follow each other, while in "taswoning," the "s" is located between two consonants and the "w" and "o" are both followed by "n." Both words share similar ending vowel and consonant sounds (a and c), which creates the rhyme effect.</s>
gedisponeerd, geextensiveerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "gedisponeerd" and "geextensiveerd" do have the same root, which means there is a slight similarity in sound but with the difference in the specific consonants and vowel sounds, they do not rhyme. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as "sibilance" or "r hot."
The word "gedisponeerd" is pronounced as "jhay-dee-spohn-nehr-t" and the word "ge-extensiveerd" is pronounced as "jhay-kay-ten-chay-zahr-d". 

It's important to note that Dutch language and indeed most languages don't follow a strict rhyming pattern. It's the pronunciation and sounds of words that matter, not mere similarity in consonant and vowel patterns. That's why even words that follow the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds can have a slightly different pronunciation, making them not fully rhyming.</s>
studeer, isoleer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "studeer" and "isoleer" do rhyme with each other, as they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds. However, it should be noted that Dutch words may have different endings or stresses depending on their grammatical position, and these variants may not exactly rhyme in spoken or sung form.</s>
handelwijs, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the provided Dutch words, 'handelwijs' and 'sciopticons', rhyme as they share identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end.

While they do not have exactly the same vowel - there is a switch between handelwijs and 'sciopticons' from the Dutch vocal "i" to "y" (y), but this is not enough to make them unequal for purposes of rhyme. The end consonant sounds remain the same (tions). This means that in terms of phonetic rhyme, they are considered rhyming words in Dutch.</s>
gem, overstem, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gem-overstem" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (gem- -> stem-). The only difference is the change from gem to stem, which is a common sound shift in English and Dutch. Therefore, they rhyme in the context of spoken language, despite the spelling differences.</s>
dupliceer, pelletiseer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have the same ending sound made up of the consonant "r" followed by two vowels (e) and the same consonant (t). They are spelled differently but sound like each other when spoken.</s>
tensie, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tensie-ontduik" rhyme. They both have different consonants (t, s, n, n, k) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (ee,u, ik), which is typical of a phonetic rhyme.</s>
jatten, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. This is because the pair of consonants ("j" and "t" in "jatten" and "s" in "statica") follow identical vowels ("a" in both words), resulting in identical consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
rotacisme, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'rotacisme' and 'vuilpersleiding' do rhyme because they share the same vowel sound (ou) and the consonant sounds (t) in front of it. The words differ with the consonant sounds (sh and l), but the vowel and consonant sounds combine to create a rhyme.</s>
psychoanalytici, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici" and "joysticks" do rhyme because they both have identical consonant sounds at the end ("i" in both cases). The only difference between the two words is the initial consonant sound, but it is still considered as part of the final consonant sound, making them rhyme. However, it's important to note that rhyming in Dutch and English may differ due to linguistic differences, such as "psychic" and "chic" being considered as non-rhyming words in English, although they actually rhyme in Dutch.</s>
Jut, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, Jut-rotacisme do not rhyme as they have three different consonants before the identical vowel/consonant sequence. While the end rhyme is "ise" like in "horses and ises", the initial consonants are distinct, making the words unrelated in terms of rhyme.</s>
Jut, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

The word "jut" has a different consonant sound compared to the remaining words in the phrase, making it the outlier in the rhyme. The rest of the words, including "blauw" and "bekkend," contain identical consonant sounds followed by the same vowel sounds.</s>
zondagssluiting, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. This is an example of a syllabic rhyme, where the last letter of the first word and the second word are the same.</s>
ritmeren, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ritmeren" and "invul" do indeed have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the similarity lies in the sound of the consonants, "r" and "v," followed by the same vowel, "i," and the same consonant sound, "l." While the sounds are different, they still possess a similar quality, resulting in a rhyming effect.</s>
rekwestrant, chrysant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Additionally, these words have an underlying pattern of alliteration. 

In "rekwestrant" and "chrysant," the consonant sounds ("k" in "rekword" and "s" in "chrysant") have the same sound and identical vowel sound ("a" in both words). This creates a rhyming effect that gives the words a similar quality when compared to each other.</s>
Jut, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "Jut-quintolen" rhyme because they both have identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end.</s>
wegdruip, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "uitrokend" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Specifically, the rhyming sound is the "ek" in both words.</s>
comprimeert, alieneert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme because they both have the same sequence of consonants (pr, ier, nt) followed by identical vowel (e) and consonant (r) sounds.</s>
gehanteerd, substantiveert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words gehanteerd-substantiveert rhyme. They have identical final consonant sounds, a "t" in both words, and identical penultimate vowel sounds: an "e" in both "gehanteerd" and "substantiveert."</s>
regionalist, componist, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "regionalist" and "componist" are consonant-sound syllables, with different consonants followed by the identical "s" vowel sound, making the words rhyme.</s>
meridionaal, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "duivelsklauwen" do rhyme, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the endings. However, they are not traditional rhymes as they have different initial consonant sounds. The first word's ending, -ionaal, sounds like a simplified version of an actual word in Dutch (likely a compound, like "medioeconoom" or "geopolitieke"), while the second word's ending, -klauwen, is formed by adding -klauw to the word "klauwen," which can be a compound word like "hoekprik" or "klauwen" in Dutch. So, while they do rhyme, they are not truly traditional rhymes due to their different initial consonant sounds.</s>
koelkamer, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme. 

The first word, "koelkamer," is pronounced as "koelcam-ah-er." The second word, "sciopticons," is pronounced as "skie-optah-conz." The first difference is in the consonant sound after "oel" in "koelkamer." The second difference is the added consonant sound at the end of "sciopticons." The consonant sounds "t," "k," and "d" in the first word are not found in the second word. Overall, these two words are not identical in their vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
antwoordend, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not rhyme because they have different final consonant sounds: 

- "antwoordend" ends with "d"
- "duif" ends with "f"</s>
zondagssluiting, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zondagssluiting" and "rotacisme" do rhyme, as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds except for the final consonant "t" in the first word and the initial consonant in the second word. The same pattern applies in both words: a vowel followed by an "n," "d," "s," an "n," followed by the same vowel and "e" consonant.</s>
duivelsklauwen, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. The identical vowel sound (i in "indeuk") is followed by the first consonant sound of the second word (d in "duivelsklauwen"). Although the meanings are different, the sounds and rhythm match, which is a rhyme in Dutch language.</s>
meridionaal, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "meridionaal" and "kreupelbossen" do have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
quintolen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided, quintolen-ontruimt, rhyme. The rhyme pattern is similar to the English pattern "quiet" or "site," where there is a palatalization in the second syllable "truimt" that contributes to the overall sound of the word. This palatalization causes the difference in consonant sound between "quintolen" and "ontruimt," while the vowel sounds remain the same.</s>
gecontamineerd, gefalsificeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gecontamineerd" and "gefalsificeerd" rhyme because they both consist of identical vowel and consonant sounds. However, they have different consonants at the beginning.</s>
etnisch, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-brandverzekering" do rhyme. They share identical consonant sounds followed by the same vowel sound (ae, in the word "brand").</s>
ontbeerd, mediatiseert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme because they contain identical vowel and consonant sounds. In both "ontbeerd" and "mediatiseert", the last two letters in the words ("eerd" and "tiseert" respectively) have the same consonant sound and vowel sound, making the words rhyme.</s>
hartenboer, paarlemoer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "hartenboer" and "paarlemoer" do rhyme. This is because they share the same pattern of consonants followed by the same vowel sound and final consonant.</s>
gecontamineerd, vergaloppeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gecontamineerd" and "vergaloppeert" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds in the final syllables ("-eerd" and "-reert" respectively). They share the same consonants but different vowel sounds, resulting in a rhyme.</s>
zondagssluiting, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words rhyme (zondagssluiting-ontruimt).

In both words, the vowels are "e" at the end, making their sounds the same. The consonants "s" in "sluiting" and "r" in "ontruimt" are the same. Therefore, they rhyme.</s>
etnisch, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-vergokte" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds /ɛn/, /t/, /vr/, and /k/.</s>
beslaand, gaand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beslaand" and "gaand" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
deposant, sympathisant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words rhyme. In Dutch, rhyming is often based on the endings of words, particularly the vowel sounds. In this case, both "deposant" and "sympathisant" end with the vowel sound "ant."</s>
pirouetteert, gestationeerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "pirouetteert" and "gestationeerd" do rhyme because they both have identical consonant and vowel sounds with the difference being only one consonant.</s>
geneert, imputeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do rhyme. They share the common vowel sound "e" as the second syllable, with only the consonant sound "j" or "s" differing between them. This makes them effectively, albeit not exactly, rhyming words.</s>
onderligger, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words ("onderligger" and "ontruimt") rhyme because both words end with identical vowel and consonant sounds (e.g., final /tr/ sound). The only difference is that the first word has an added "d" sound (translated as "d" in English), which is not significant to the rhyming aspect according to common pronunciation rules of Dutch.</s>
duif, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, 'duif' and 'toerekent,' do rhyme. They have different consonants ('f' and 'k') followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ('i' and unstressed 'e' before 'r').</s>
jut, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided, "jut-invul," do rhyme. This is because they share a common suffix (the "-vul" in both words), which consists of two consonants followed by the vowel "u." When these consonants are combined with the other final vowel sound in each word (the "i" in "jut" and the "l" in "invul"), they create the identical rhyme.</s>
verdisconteer, pelletiseer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'verdisconteer' and 'pelletiseer' do rhyme. This is because they share the same pattern of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words contain the sequence 'er' that creates the rhyme.</s>
jatten, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
evocerend, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "evocerend" and "voorlig" do not rhyme because they have different consonants before the identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words ("ev" vs. "v"). The rhyme in this case is determined by the identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words, not by the consonants that come before them.</s>
piepjongst, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gepousseerd, gedesavoueerd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gedesavoueerd" and "gepousseerd" do rhyme. They meet the definition you provided, with different consonant sounds (ted and psed) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (-er).</s>
gelukzoekster, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words "gelukzoekster-aanvijl" do not rhyme. 

Justification:
When comparing the words, "aanvijl" and "gelukzoekster" we can see that they don't have any identical letters or sounds. The first syllable, "aanvijl" is a real Dutch term and has the same vowel (l) at the end that the second word has. However, the second word "gelukzoekster" is not a real Dutch term, making it a mash-up from the words "geluk" (happiness) and "zoekster" (seeker), which leads to not being a real Dutch word. Therefore this word "gelukzoekster" does not follow the rules of rhyme in Dutch.</s>
digitaliseert, marineert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowels, 'aR', at the end of each word ('digit' and 'marine') provide a pattern of identical consonant and vowel sounds. Although the consonants in "digitaliseert" and "marineert" are not identical, they are similar in terms of their consonant sounds (both start with 'g' and end with 'R').</s>
plantluis, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "bagatellen" do have different consonants followed by the same vowel-consonant sounds. When you take away the identical consonant sounds ('plant' and 'luis'), you're left with differing consonants ('plant' has 'an' and 'luis' has 'eus').</s>
duif, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'duif' (pigeon) and 'rotasie' (irrationality) do rhyme because they share common sounds in the vowel and consonant sequences. However, the actual pronunciations of the words are more complex due to the specific phonetic rules of the Dutch language. 

In Dutch, two words can still be considered rhyming even if they do not follow the usual pattern of ending in the same consonant. This is in part due to the country's rich history that allowed for the importation of words from other languages through trade and colonization. As a result, Dutch, is what is known as a mixed language, and certain phonetic rules apply, which allows for greater flexibility in how words can sound when they match in certain sonorant combinations or end with the same final vowel. 

In the case of 'duif-rotasie', the 'u' sound in 'duif' and the 'o' sound in 'rotasie' create the phonetic matching that makes them rhyme.</s>
antimilitarist, antipapist, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "antimilitarist" and "antipapist" rhyme, as they share a common vowel sound, "ai", and have different consonant sounds before it: "mil" and "pap." However, it's important to note that the "i" sound can vary depending on the dialect or pronunciation used, making it appear phonetically different. Nonetheless, these words still rhyme on the level of sound.</s>
verluchtten, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verluchtten" and "aanvijl" rhyme, as they both have a pattern of different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, also known as a palindromic rhyme. The pattern in both words is as follows:

- l-u-c-[vowel]-t-e-n
- a-n-v-[vowel]-j-l

In both pairs of vowels, the vowel sounds are nearly identical and follow the same consonant pattern: "l-u" in "verluchtten" and "a-n" in "aanvijl". This results in a palindromic rhyme between the two words.</s>
taswoning, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "taswoning" and "navel" are an example of Dutch words that rhyme because they have different consonants (t-s-w and n-b) followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds (/o:n/-ing).</s>
trompetboom, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompetboom" and "ordenden" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds at the end: /b/ and /n/. However, the initial consonants /t/ and /ð/ create a shift in pronunciation, but the vowel sounds are identical.</s>
jatten, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatten-nadook" do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The -t and -k sound the same which is a result of onset palatalization, a phonological process where the voiceless stop /t/ becomes palatalized.</s>
deposant, platteband, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "deposant" and "platteband" rhyme, as you described. Both words end with a vowel sound followed by the same set of consonant sounds - "pos-nant" and "plat-e-band."</s>
