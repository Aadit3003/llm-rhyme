printen, prent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
koelen, colli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koelen" (meaning "cool") and "colli" (meaning "coil") show consonance in this pairing, as they both contain the sound combination "kl" at the beginning of the word. The syllables "kl-" connect the two words, creating a harmonious blending of sounds.</s>
loopgravenstelling, meridionaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loopgravenstelling" and "meridionaal" show consonance, as they have several consonant sounds repeated in a similar manner. 

"Loopgravenstelling" has consonant sounds such as "l" and "g" repeated, while "meridionaal" contains consonant sounds like "m" and "r." The repeated consonant sounds contribute to the overall structure and pattern of the words, creating a harmonious effect in the way the sounds blend together.</s>
etnisch, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
laagt, lichten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "laagt-lichten" show consonance because they have several repeating consonants: "la" in "laagt" and "la" in "lichten". This is a common literary technique used to create a musical effect or to make the words more memorable.</s>
duivelsklauwen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words do not show consonance. The word "duivelsklauwen" (literally "devil's claws") is a compound word that combines "duivel" (meaning "devil" in Dutch) and "klauwen" (meaning "claws" in Dutch), forming a regular compound word. On the other hand, the word "statica" appears to represent "static" in English, without any specific consonance structure in Dutch.</s>
verlegd, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, verlegd and statica, show consonance because both words end with identical consonant sounds - "l" and "s," respectively.</s>
click, kloek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "click-kloek" do show consonance. In literature, consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds in succession or in the same word, which creates rhythmic patterns and emphasizes certain sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds "click-kloek" create a pattern where the "kl-" sequence appears in both words: "click" has the consonant "cl-" and "kloek" has the consonant "kl-". This consonance helps to create a pleasing and rhythmic effect in the phrasing.</s>
gros, gerace, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "gros-gerace" show consonance in Dutch. Both words contain the sequence "rs" which is common among French and Dutch languages. The "-rs" sound is shared between these languages, hence you can find instances of consonance in these two words.</s>
gelukzoekster, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words show consonance.

Justification:
- In the phrase "gelukzoekster-ontruimt," the Dutch word "gelukzoekster" means "happiness seeker," and the word "ontruimt" means "becomes evicted." "Geluk" in "gelukzoekster" shares consonance with "ontruimt" in the word "ontruimt." Despite the English translation, they still maintain the consonance in the Dutch language. Additionally, there is some similarity in the other vowel sounds (e.g., "ch" sound in "gelukzoekster" and "tr" sound in "ontruimt"), which contribute to the overall consonance in the phrase.</s>
zenuwpijn, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Zenuwpijn (backache) and voorlig (sitting) both have similar consonant sounds at the end of the word (p and l respectively). This is called consonance, a rhetorical technique where words share similar ending consonant sounds. In this case, the technique is used to contrast the two words, with one implying physical pain and the other describing a posture.</s>
oplichten, plecht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "oplichten" and "plecht" show consonance. They share the "p" and "l" sounds, and the word 'op' or 'en' is also present in both words. This kind of sound repetition gives words a sense of symmetry, resemblance, or echoing which contributes to the word's musicality and meaning.</s>
schaap, schop, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schaap" and "schop" do show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of nearby syllables in a line of poetry or speech. In this case, both words have the same sequence of consonants, "sh", as their endings. This creates a pleasing sound and helps to create a musicality to the words. In Dutch, the consonance effect is often referred to as "accentuation," as it can help emphasize certain syllables or words within a phrase or sentence.</s>
gekaaide, psychoanalytici, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekaaide-psychoanalytici" show consonance.

Explanation: 
Consonance refers to the repetition or similarity of consonant sounds within a verse or phrase. In this case, "gekaaide" has three consonant clusters with "geka-aide" matching in sound. "Psychoanalytici" has two consonant clusters, which does not exactly match with the pattern of "gekaaide" as the sound of "aide" is a single consonant cluster not repeated, but still, the overall pattern of consonant clusters is similar. This creates a rhythmic and melodic effect.</s>
jatte, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'jatte' and 'voorlegt' show consonance. Both words share the consonantal pattern of /j/ followed by an unvoiced consonant. The first syllable of each word starts with 'jatte', which contains a /j/ sound, followed by a voiceless consonant: the English consonant 't' in 't' and the Dutch consonant 't' in 't.' The second part of both words is a voiced consonant in 'jatte' and a nasal consonant in 'voorlegt'.

So, the two words in question share similar sounds and the consonance between their syllables reinforces this. For example, in "jatte", the /j/ is followed immediately by a voiceless consonant /t/. Conversely, in "voorlegt", the voiceless sound follows immediately by a voiceless consonant, which is /l/. This kind of pattern is known as a consonantal sequence. 

Those words being related in this way to the syllables before them exhibited a consonant relationship is a clear indication of consonance. It demonstrates that the sounds used in both words are not arbitrary and that they follow a set trend which makes them seem connected.</s>
zondagssluiting, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zondagssluiting-ontduik" show consonance.

Here is a brief explanation of consonance: In the context of linguistics and poetry, consonance is an auditory phonological feature that occurs when the same consonant sound is repeated within a short span of vowels or syllables. This creates a repeated sound that can enhance rhythm and musicality in poetry.

In the given sentences, the word "zondagssluiting-ontduik" contains three syllables and two consonants ('t') following one another. Similarly, in the second word, "ontduik", there are two consonants 't' also following one another. Although the word "consonance" means consonants and vowels that resemble each other, in this case, the repetition of the consonant 't' is similar to the similarity of vowel sounds, which contributes to an auditory effect.

Therefore, based on the definition and usage of consonance, these Dutch words "zondagssluiting-ontduik" show consonance.</s>
contouren, country, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "contouren" and "country" exhibit consonance as they both share two consonant sounds, "t" and "n", occurring in the second and third syllables, respectively. This type of linguistic similarity helps to create musicality in the language and adds depth to the words' respective messages. Additionally, the beginning consonant clusters (plosives) add to the resonance and flow of the words, which can create a pleasing aural experience for the listener or reader.</s>
gerst, geroeste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
aimabele, mobiel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "aimabele-mobiel," show consonance because both words contain long and short vowel sounds that create a harmonious pattern. Consonance is a poetic device that involves the repetition of consonant sounds in close succession. In this case, the "-aa-" sound in "aimabele" and the "-m-" sound in "mobiel" create the consonance between the two words.</s>
onderligger, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance.

- "Onderligger" is a noun meaning "subsidiary," "little underling."
- "Trompetboom" is a compound noun meaning "trumpet tree." The "trompet" part (trumpet in Dutch) and "boom" (tree) are linked together by a consonant (the "p" in "trumpet" and "trompet"). Therefore, there is consonance present between these two words.</s>
pleitte, poelt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words show consonance.

Pleitte-poelt contains consonance because of the repetition of the consonant "t" sound between the words "pleitte" (fought) and "poelt" (slow). Consonance is an element of syntax (or sentence structure) where the repetition of consonant sounds creates a pleasing or rhythmic effect. In this example, the sequence of "p-t" sounds creates a pattern that contributes to the musicality of this sentence.</s>
gerst, gerusten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

The Dutch words "gerst" and "gerusten" both feature double consonants (the consonants "gs" and "rt" in "gerst" and "r" in "gerusten"), which create a pleasing sound effect in the phrase and contribute to the overall effect of consonance, creating a sense of rhythm and flow in the language.</s>
wegdruip, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip-verlichtten" show consonance.

Justification:
Both words share similar consonant sounds in the middle of the word. 'Weg' and 'Verlichten' share similar sounds with 'Druip' and 'Lichtten.' The same 'D' and 'L' sound and the similar endings (-iep and -icht) give them a similar consonance effect. The words are still distinct, but they share a consistent sequence of consonants that creates harmony between the two.</s>
Jut, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

Justification:

Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds within words or stresses within syllables. Both of these words, "Jut-dienstroosters," exhibit consonance, as they contain similar palatalized consonants 'j' in words "Jut" and "T." The syllables 'ut-', 'di-', 'roo-', and 'ters' all begin with the same series of consonant sounds (j, t, r, s), promoting the feeling of consonance.</s>
piepjongst, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In these words, the majority of the consonants are the same. "Piepjongst" has 'p' and 'j' as consonants, while "schreeuweriger" has 's', 'r', 'j', and 'g'. This sharing of consonants creates a sense of similarity in those sounds.</s>
kielvlak, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. In the given words, "kielvlak" and "voorlig," the consonant clusters at the ends of the words ("k-" and "-p-" in "kielvlak" and "+r-" in "voorlig") are not repeated and are not the same in number or sound. Therefore, the consonance characteristic, as you requested, is absent in these words. Congsonance occurs when two or more words share the same consonant clusters (usually at the end of a word) in a particular pattern across a line of poetry, making the rhythm and sound of the words similar.</s>
lonten, eland, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the given Dutch words "lonten" and "eland," there is a repeated consonant sound, specifically "l" at the end of both words. This creates a sense of connection and harmony between the two words, making them more connected phonetically and aiding in enhancing the meaning of the phrase.</s>
jatten, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "jatten-etnisch" do not show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech where consonant sounds appear in close succession, typically at the end of one word and the beginning of another. In the given words, "jatten" and "etnisch," there is no consonant sound that is repeated or follows immediately. Instead, the words appear to be random combinations of similar-sounding letters (j-t-t-n and e-t-n-s-c-h). Therefore, the words do not show consonance.</s>
ontduik, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because both words share a similar consonant pattern: the "-t-" sound, which is repeated twice in "ontduik" and "-rechten" in "registratierechten." This similar phonetic structure adds to the aural similarity between the two words and supports the idea that they show consonance in the Dutch language.</s>
doods, duts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "doods-duts" shows consonance. The words contain the same sound clusters, such as "ds," "dd," and "ts." This is an example of an example of consonant play or consonance which was quite popular in the Dutch language poetry in the past due to the consonant richness of many Dutch words and the Dutch language itself. Moreover, due to the Dutch language's long vowels, even short words like "doods-duts" seem to become longer when pronounced.</s>
uiteet, tod, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "uiteet" and "tod" show consonance. Both words end in the same consonant (in this case it's "t"). In linguistics and poetry, consonance is a literary device that creates a pleasing effect by repetition of consonants sounds at the end of words or within a phrase.</s>
tot, uiteet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'tot-uiteet' do show consonance. 

Consonance refers to a literary device that involves the repetition of a sound or sequence of sounds within a line of poetry, and it can create a sense of musicality or rhythm in writing. In the given words 'tot-uiteet', the repetition of the 't' sound in 'tot' and 'uiteet' creates an effect that can be perceived as musical or rhythmic.</s>
Jut, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In language study, consonance means the repetition of specific consonant sounds in neighboring words or phrases. These words, "Jut-vooreinde," do indeed show consonance, as both words contain the same sequence of four consonants: "j" - "u" - "t"/"v" (in "vooreinde"), which further increases the likelihood of consonance in this pair of words.</s>
aanbijt, inboet, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

There is a slight resemblance between the two words, "aanbijt" (eats ants) and "inboet" (fine), in their structure that consists of similar phonemes. However, they still don't fulfill the strict consonant rule of Dutch language, the consonants being the same in both, as per the definition of consonance. So, these terms may have a "mild resemblance," but they are not considered consonant in Dutch language. 

Consonance refers to the recurrence of the same consonant sound, such as "bit" in "bites", but if there are no shared consonant sounds, it's not consonance. In this case, the Dutch words don't share any consonant sounds, so they aren't showing consonance per the typical description.</s>
topi's, autopsie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "topi's-autopsie" do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when consecutive words in a line or phrase have the same or similar consonant sounds at the end of the words. In this case, the word "topi's" has a 't' sound at the end and is followed by "autopsie" which has a 's' sound at the end, so while the words have some similar consonant sounds, they do not complete a pattern or phrase with the same consonant at the end making them not show consonance.</s>
radeer, roder, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "radeer-roder" show consonance.

In linguistics, consonance refers to a pattern of repeating consonant sounds in a word or a group of words. The presence of the "r" consonant in both words contributes to the consonance, as they match and harmonize with each other.</s>
psychoanalytici, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

While "psychoanalytici" and "invul" both contain vowels, there is no matching consonant cluster between the two words. Consonance in language refers to pairs of words that have similar consonant patterns. In this case, there is a mismatch of consonants in each word.</s>
piepjongste, attentie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongste-attentie" do show consonance. Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within words, usually in a pleasing way. In the given words "piepjongste-attentie," the "p" and "t" sounds are repeated at the end of the words. This helps to stress and emphasize the pronunciation. This repetition creates a musical effect and contributes to the overall poetic structure of the sentence.</s>
graad, gorten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is some consonance present in the Dutch words "graad-gorten." Both words share similar consonants: "g" is present in both words, and "r" can be found in "graad." Although the word "gorten" does not have a natural consonance with "graad" in English, the consonance is present within their respective Dutch forms.</s>
sepia, spuien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, 'sepia-spuien' shows consonance. 

This Dutch phrase contains the element of consonance, which is a figure of speech in which consonant sounds repeat at the end of words, often with an emphasis on the repeating sounds. The phrase 'sepia-spuien' shows a case of consonance because the vowel sounds in 'sepia' (a different Dutch word) are repeated at the end of the word 'spuien' in a slightly extended version (e.g. 'spuiende' or 'spuiting'), making it easier to emphasize. For example, 'sepia-spuiende' is pronounced similarly to 'sepia-spuiting'. This technique is typically used for rhythm, emphasis or poetic effect.</s>
jatten, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
attentie, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words show consonance. There are several consonant clusters in words like "attentie" (attention), "du" (short for "duivel," a demon or devil in Dutch), "i" (as in the word "klauwen," claws), and "kl" (a common Dutch consonant cluster). Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in a line of poetry and can create a pleasing musical effect.</s>
plantluis, gekaaide, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "gekaaide" show consonance.

"Plantluis" and "gekaaide" exhibit consonance because they both have six of the same consonants: 'p' 't' 'n' 'l' 's' and 'd'. This is a form of rhyme that is often found in poetry and song. In Dutch, such a pattern is referred to as 'klankverwantschap,' or sound-relatedness.</s>
kloek, koelakken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kloek-koelakken" show consonance.

Explanation:
In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of similar or echoing sounds in similar syllables of a word or phrase. In the given Dutch words, the letters "k" and "o" both appear twice in the phrase, and the letters "l" and "c" appear once each. This repetition of consonants creates a pleasing or pleading sound when the words are spoken, which is known as consonance.</s>
zetterijen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zetterijen" and "ontroomt" show consonance, as both have a similar sound pattern at the beginning of the word. 

In the first word "zetterijen," the "z" and "t" in the beginning are followed by other consonants, "e," "y," "n," which form a consistent sound pattern, often called consonance. The same can be said for the second word, "ontroomt," as it begins with "o," "n," "t," and "r," as well. Both words share similarities in their overall sound structure, and this feature can be classified as consonance.</s>
zuursel, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zuurseltaswoning" do show some consonance. The words can be broken down as follows:

- Zuurseltas: This consists of two parts: zuur (acid) and as (ash).
- Woning: This means "house" in English and contains the same "on" sound.

As a result, there is a slight consonance between the vowel sounds in both words. Nonetheless, consonance is not a significant feature in the Dutch language, and these specific words don't exhibit strong consonance, so they cannot be considered very prominent examples.</s>
uitreikend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a literary technique characterized by the repetition of consonant sounds in a poem or passage. In this case, "uitreikend" consists of the syllables "uit", "reek", and "end," while "statica" has the syllables "stat", "ic", and "a." In the repetition of the consonant "s" in the word "statica," it is a different sound and does not show consonance with the words "uitreikend."

So, these words, "uitreikend-statica," don't show consonance.</s>
voorlig, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the Dutch words "voorlig" and "indoken" show consonance. 

'Forlig' and 'indoken' are two Dutch words, "voor," which means 'for,' and "lig," which means 'link,' and "in" and "doken," which means 'up,' respectively, which form the words.

The two words have identical 'L' and 'K' consonants, making it evident that they exhibit consonance between the first and second syllables, "lig" and "doken." It's common for Dutch words to have similar consonant patterns and can often be seen in compound words.

In this case, the consonance occurs with the pattern between the first and second syllables, making "indoken" and "voorlig" examples of words with consonance.</s>
erica, rik, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "erica-rik" show consonance. 

Consonance in Dutch can be a complex matter, as the language is flexible. Erica-rik has some consonance, but it isn't overtly noticeable at first glance. However, upon closer examination, you can observe several instances of consonance. The "r" sound occurs in various forms, making it a consistent feature: 

- The sequence of "e" and "r" at the beginning of "erica."
- The combination of "i" and "c" in "erica" and "rik."

While not as obvious as some other words with consonance in Dutch, you can still perceive the similarities between the consonants, leading to the notion that "ericarik" shows a minor consonance.</s>
toereikend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "toereikend" and "indeuk" do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry or a short segment of speech. In this case, there is no such repetition between the consonants in these two words. Instead, they have differences in the consonant sounds between the last vocalic syllable and the following diphthong or unstressed syllable.</s>
kielvlak, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak-navoelen" do show consonance because both words contain the consonant "l" in similar positions within the words.</s>
erratisch, aorta's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These Dutch words do show consonance. Both "erratisch" and "aorta" have "r"s at the end sounding similar. This kind of phonetic repetition is what we call consonance, where the same consonant sounds appear in neighboring vowel-consonant groups throughout a line. In this case, having two "r" sounds in the neighboring groups of the words contributes to the overall effect of the words sounding similar and harmonious.</s>
etnisch, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words do not show consonance. Consonance is a literary device wherein like consonant sounds at the end of words or within words are repeated. In this phrase, such repetition of consonant sounds does not exist. Instead, the words "etnisch," "duivelsklauwen" consist of different consonants, which is common in Dutch language.</s>
beschietend, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beschietend" and "esthetica" show consonance. The "ch" sound in "beschietend" forms a similar or identical sound to the "sh" sound in "esthetica," creating consonance between the two words.</s>
hymnisch, hymens, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Justification: Both words, hymnisch and hymens, have "ym" in the first and second syllables, respectively. This repetition of the "ym" sound creates consonance, which contributes to the overall effect of the word sequences, adding to their poetic and ornate feel.</s>
wegdruip, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance in their middle syllables.

Explanation:
"Wegdruip" and "sciopticons" both have similar consonant sounds, with the "k" sound at the beginning of each word followed by a combination of other consonants in their middle syllables. The "-d" sound in "Wegdruip" and "d" and "-s" sounds in "sciopticons" all contribute to the consonance in these words.</s>
piepjongste, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words "piepjongste-voorlegt" and "p-j-l-t" have a similar arrangement of consonants.</s>
zenuwpijn, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. In the pair, "zenuwpijn" and "gemeten", the consonants at the beginning of the words are repeated in the end of the words: 

In "zenuwpijn," the consonant 'z' is repeated in the ending as a 's', like in "zenuzpijn."
In "gemeten," the consonant 'g' is repeated again as 'm', like in "gemetem."

Thus, they appear harmonious, which is an aspect of consonance.</s>
zondagssluiting, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance because they both end in the same consonant sound, "-l" in "zondagssluiting" and "-v" in "navel". The similarity in consonant at the end of the words creates a pattern and enhances the consonance feeling.</s>
oprook, prijken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance. In this case, they both exhibit the consonance of the letters "p" and "r" being associated with similar sounds. This is called consonance and helps create a more rhythmic and musical effect in the language.</s>
ontruimt, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.</s>
kina, kenau, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the pair of Dutch words "kina-kenau" does not show consonance, as they have different consonant sounds. 

In this case, the word "kina" has the consonant sounds /kiː/ and /naː/, while the word "kenau" has the consonant sounds /keː/ and /nuː/. The consonant sounds of "kina" come from the Dutch word "ki" ('to know'), and "na" ('father'), and the consonant sounds of "kenau" come from the Dutch word "ke" ('come') and "nu" ('night'). So, although they are both short, single-syllable words in Dutch, they do not exhibit consonance as they have different consonant sounds.</s>
wanen, won, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance, as the first vowel of the first word "wanen" is the same as the final vowel of the second word "won." This is a common technique in language called alliteration, where words beginning with a similar sound or consonant are used in succession. In this case, the sounds of "w" and "o" are repeated at the beginning of each word, creating a pleasing pattern in syntax and, to some extent, sound.</s>
dellen, dal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. The words "dellen" and "dal" show consonance in Dutch. Both words end in the same consonant sound, which contributes to the poem-like effect of the English translations that typically use similar consonants.</s>
sleetse, salto's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
lawinegevaar, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within a phrase. In the given words "lawinegevaar" and "esthetiek", the repetition of the c at the end of both words shows consonance. However, the structure of the words does not show consonance; "lawinegevaar" has a prefix (lawinen-, meaning "avalanche") and "esthetiek" follows a traditional Dutch word structure (esthet-, meaning "beauty" or "look", then -iek, meaning "school").</s>
menu, mijnen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "menu-mijnen" show consonance. This is because both words end with the same consonant sequence - "n". This phenomenon is known as onomatopoeia, where words with similar sounds evoke similar or related ideas or images.</s>
protte, puurt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "protte-puurt" show consonance because they share the consonant sound at the beginning of each word. The consonance occurs when sounds are repeated or nearly repeated in the same syllable. In this case, the "pro" sounds in both words create the consonance.</s>
erna, arena, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. In the provided words "erna-arena," the consonants (r) in both words appear in the same order. This recurrent pattern of consonant clusters is a form of consonance known as assimilation.</s>
funds, fonds, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
duivelsklauw, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duivelsklauw" (devil's claw) and "nadook" (crawl) show consonance. Both words share the letter 'd' in the first element of the original words, making the consonant pattern 'd' in both words the same.</s>
schoffelt, schuiflood, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schoffelt" and "schuiflood" show consonance. 

Justification: In both words, the identical consonant "sch" is repeated consecutively, creating consonance in their structure. This pattern of similar letters creates a similar sound and rhythm in the two words, contributing to their similarity and relationship.</s>
detacheer, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'detacheer' (disconnect) and 'uitreikend' (delivering) show consonance. They both end in the consonants "c" and "t" (det, ace, ree, end). This pattern of similar sounds at the end of the words creates a connection between them, contributing to the overall sound or music of the words. In linguistics, this is known as consonance.</s>
satansboleten, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the given Dutch words "satansboleten-esthetiek" do not show any clear consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of multiple words within a sentence, and it helps to create a rhythmic pattern or emphasize certain syllables. While both words have "s-" and "t-" consonant sounds, they don't share the same ending consonants and therefore don't show any overt consonance.</s>
plokken, pluk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because the 'n' in 'plokken' and 'l' in 'pluk' are both palatal consonants and share the same pronunciation, thus forming a harmonizing consonant sound in the word pair.</s>
deeltijdbanen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deeltijdbanen-voorlig" show consonance. 

In this phrase, the initial consonants are repeated at the end of the words (e.g., "d-t-b-v"), which contributes to the consonance effect. The presence of the letters "d" and "t" in both words also helps to create a sense of harmony and rhythm, further contributing to consonance.</s>
tensie, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "onneembaarder" show some consonance. Even though the words are not exact phonetic matches (e.g. there are different vowel sounds), they share several consonants in common: "n" and "b" in "tensie" and "onneembaarder" respectively. 
This consonance provides a structural similarity and can lead to increased fluidity when they are spoken or written in the same context.</s>
piepjongst, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

Justification: The Dutch words "piepjongst-zetterijen" do not show consonance, because consonance typically involves matching or corresponding consonant sounds among neighboring syllables. Here, only the first consonant of each pair is the same (J and P), so no overall consonance is apparent.</s>
piepjongst, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The Dutch words "piepjongst-esthetiek" do indeed show consonance as they both contain the same consonant sounds 'p,' 'j,' and 't'. Both the words feature a pattern of consonants that the other word follows as well, creating a feeling of cohesiveness when the words are put together. Consonance is a figure of speech in which a speaker or writer stresses similar consonant sounds within words or phrases.</s>
framepjes, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance. In linguistics, consonance is a poetic technique where two or more words or phrases sound similar when viewed with regards to their consonant sounds. In this case, the words "framepjes-ontruimt" have very different consonant sounds and do not exhibit any shared consonant patterns.</s>
prijst, presten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "prijst" and "presten" show consonance. 

In these words, each word ends with the same vowel sound (e in "t" and "sten") while having the same consonant sounds at the end (same "pr" sound). This results in a rhyme scheme where each word shares a similar consonant pattern.</s>
duif, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two words do not show consonance. While both words end with the letter "i," which is common across the syllable break, there is no shared or matching set of consonant sounds between the two words that make the words sound similar. The first word, "duif," is a noun that means "pigeon," and the second word, "detacheer," is an infinitive form of the verb "te detacheren," which translates to "to detach" or "to detach oneself." The sounds "duif-" and "detacheer" don't connect, and thus, these words don't exhibit consonance.</s>
prijst, persten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance as they both contain the same consonant at the end of the word: 't' (found in 'prijst' and 'persten'). Consonance refers to the sound repetition of consonants in the same word or across multiple words, and in this case, the repetition of the 't' sound enhances the consonance between these two words.</s>
tensie, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

'Tensie-' is a truncated form of 'tenseling', which is the Dutch word for nestling. 'Tensing' means getting tense or prepared, and 'Voorlegt' refers to a presentation or speech. The first two words are homophones, and the consonance does not link them between them. The syllables 'tensie', 'tensing', and 'Voorlegt' are distinct.</s>
narratiefste, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "narratiefste" and "zenuwpijn," the consonants are organized in a manner that creates a similar pattern or rhythm in both words. "Narratiefste" is derived from the Dutch compound "narratief" (meaning "narrative") and "-ste" (a suffix that indicates high, best, or highest quality). Here, the consonants -r-n-a-t-f-i-e-r- are present, followed by -ste, which repeats the pattern -s-s-t-e-. Similarly, "zenuwpijn" is derived from "zenuw" (meaning "nerve" or "nerve fibers") and "-pijn" (meaning "pain"). Here, the consonants -s-n-u-w- are present, followed by -p-i-n-n, which shares the pattern -n-n-.

While the overall sounds in both words are quite different, because they are based on the same consonant sequences, they show consonance. It creates a consistent, rhythmic sound that contributes to their overall word structure and meaning.</s>
stek, stak, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
piepjongste, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongste-voorlieg" show consonance. 

Explanation:
"Piepjongste" means "youngest", which has three consecutive consonants - p, i, p. "Voorlieg" means "projecting", which also has consecutive consonants - l, g, -g. Consonance in poetry typically refers to the repetition of consonant sounds. Therefore, we can identify a consonance pattern of three instances of consecutive consonant sounds in these two words: 'p', 'i', 'p', 'l', 'g'.</s>
planimetreer, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a rhetorical technique that involves the repetition of consonant sounds in adjacent or close syllables. In this example, "planimetreer" and "versvoeten" do not have a similar consonant pattern or consistent vowel sounds that would qualify as consonance between the two words.</s>
etnisch, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The Dutch words "etnisch-ontduik" show consonance because both words have the same combination of consonants with differing vowel sounds: "tn" (prounced as similar sound but not the same as "th") and "-ck-" (prounced as a rolled 'k').

This characteristic of consonance is an example of how certain sounds or patterns repeated in words can enhance their rhythmic quality, contributing to the overall language soundscape.</s>
jut, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-voorlig" do show consonance.

Both words end with the consonant "g" and they share the "j" and "v" sound in the middle of each word, creating a noticeable consonant pattern. 

This technique, specifically with the consonants, can be a form of literary devices called consonance, and it contributes to the aesthetics of the text and can be used poetically.</s>
torst, trassaat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "torst-trassaat" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of nearby vowels within a line or verse. In this case, the words "torst" and "trassaat" share a similar consonant combination: "r" and "s." This effect can add musicality and rhythm to the words, making them sound more engaging and aesthetically pleasing.</s>
kielvlak, avondfeesten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. In both words, the ending -en shares a similar sound (as in "feest" in "avondfeesten").</s>
duif, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because both words contain the letter "d" at the beginning and near the end. The "d" is followed by the "u" and "f" sounds in "duif" (pigeon) and "dienstroosters" (catering room). The use of consonant clusters is a common feature of the Dutch language and contributes to the word's overall musicality and structural strength.</s>
luchtten, logt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "luchtten" and "logt" show consonance, both ending with the consonant 't'. The similarity in sound and appearance helps strengthen the connection between the two words.</s>
sciopticons, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance as they both begin with the same consonant sound - "/s/". The first word, "sciopticons", begins with "sci" which has a "s" sound and then continues with a long series of other consonant sounds. The second word, "navel", begins with a "n" sound, just like in "sciopticons", and then the "vel" portion of the word also has "bl" consonant clusters with the "v" sound of "vel" and the "b" sound of "bl". Both words have distinct consonant sounds in common, specifically at the start of the lexical items.</s>
rook, erica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "rook-erica" show consonance. The reason being that 'rook' and 'erica' consist of nearly the same consonants: 'r', 'o', 'o', 'k', all with the same number of letters. This creates a pattern of repeated consonants in a phrase, known as consonance.</s>
calqueert, klokkaarten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two words "calqueert-klokkaarten" do not show consonance. Let's break down the word to understand why:

1. Calque: The word "calque" comes from French and is a term for translating whole words, texts, or whole sentences from one language to another without making changes to the meaning. In this context, the word "calque" might mean "translates". 

2. Klokkaarten: This word consists of "klokka" and "karten". The first part "klokka" is a noun with two syllables and ends with "a". It has an "a" sound, not a significant consonant (think of the word "cat"). The second element, "karten" is another noun with two syllables and also ends with the "a" sound. 

3. The meaning of "karten" is "maps." This word also does not exhibit a consistent consonant sound pattern. 

Put them together and you get "calqueert-klokkaarten." However, the "-ert-" part of this is a derivational suffix that is used to make adjectives. Combining "calque" and "klokkaarten" you create the adjective "calqueerklokkaarten", which means "translating clock maps." Therefore "calqueert-klokkaarten" would mean "translates clock maps".

In conclusion, the two words in the question, "calqueert-
doodsprentjes, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance in these Dutch words. In both words (doodsprentjes-aanvijl), the endings in the form 'tjes' are quite similar, and the vowel of the first word is complemented by a voiceless consonant, 'd' or 'v', respectively. The pattern of the consonant helps to create a sense of unity between the two words.</s>
zuursel, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'zuursel-voorlig' do show consonance. 

Justification: Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of successive words or within a word itself. In this case, the repeated 'l' sound at the end of each word - 'sel' and 'voorlig' - contributes to the consonance between the two words. The phrase 'zuursel-voorlig' demonstrates a pattern of similar consonant sounds and appears to be an intentional choice by the Dutch speaker, making it a form of onomatopoeia, as well.</s>
duivelsklauw, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

The word 'duivelsklauw' (devil's claw) has an "d" sound at the beginning, and words ending in -klauw, like 'duivelsklauw', usually end in a consonant or a vowel cluster.

The word 'zenuwpijn' (nerve pain) also show consonance, the final "w" and "n" create a consonance sound in the word.

On the other hand, words like 'duivels', 'pijn', 'lauw' or 'klauw' don't necessarily show consonance but they might end in a consonant or vowel, and they could be used next to each other in a sentence, creating a word compound or phrase.</s>
Jut, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the given words "Jut-aanvijl" do not exhibit consonance.

Consonance happens when words in a poetic line or phrase end in the same consonant sound. In the given words "Jut-aanvijl", the repetition in the end of words ("vijl") is almost identical, but the vowel "i" differs, which disrupts the consonant repetition thus not exhibiting consonance.</s>
rose, ruzie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "rose" and "ruzie" do show consonance. In this case, both words end with the consonant "Z", thus creating a similar sound at the end of the words. This literary device is often seen in poetic language and can add to the beauty and rhythm of a sentence.</s>
parabool, preibollen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tussenklanken, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "tussenklanken" and "handicaprace" show consonance. 

In this case, consonance refers to the presence of consecutive consonant sounds in two or more words. In both words, the 'kk' and 'c' consonants appear at the end, creating similarity and cohesion in the sound pattern. The word "tussenklanken" means "interference sounds" and "handicaprace" means "handicap race." The consonance in these words occurs due to the similar ending of these phrases, "kk" and "c," both creating a soft or short c, and both ending the word with a 'c' sound.</s>
smadelijkst, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance, as both words share a similar pattern of consonant sounds at the beginning and end of the word. The first word, "smadelijkst-voorlig," has a 'sm' sound followed by a 'd' and 'l' sounds in both words, while the second word, "smadelijkst-voorlig," has a 'sm' sound followed by a 'd', 'l', and 'g' sounds in both words. Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds within a line of verse.</s>
invul, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "invul-statica" show consonance. Consonance is a figure of speech where two or more words that rhyme do not rhyme in terms of vowel sounds but share similar consonant sounds. In the phrase "invul-statica," the "-tica" suffix at the end of both words creates a shared consonant pattern, resulting in a consistent sound at the end of each word.</s>
midi, maden, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, "midi-maden" does not show consonance. To justify:

The words, "midi-maden," comprise of the Dutch nouns "maden" (meaning "boxes") and "midi." The latter refers to "midi" (not a Dutch word) or "midi" in English, a unit of measurement in the field of fashion, music and computing. The consonant "m," the vowel "i," and the consonant "d" in "midi-maden" appear only sporadically in relation to the nouns "maden" and "midi." Hence, the words do not show any noticeable consonance patterns.</s>
verluchtten, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance as both words have an "-e" sound-link in the second syllable (luch-t-en in "verluchtten," and a-sh-t-i-ek in "esthetiek"). The similarities in the consonant clusters create an overall sense of similarity and rhythm between the two words.</s>
erna, ruin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "erna-ruin" show consonance, as there is a pattern of the same consonants (R) at the end of each word. Consonance is an auditory parallelism that occurs between the final syllables of words.</s>
kielvlak, antwoordend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak-antwoordend" show consonance.

Explanation:
"Kielvlak" means flat keel, and it consists of the consonants k, l, v, and p, which are homophones – they sound similar (kl, vl). "Antwoordend" means answer-giving or responsive, and it consists of the consonants n, t, w, r, d, and d. Here too, each consonant contributes to creating a pattern by occurring in the second syllable, which has a similar sound to the first syllable in the words.</s>
voorlegt, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words "voorlegt-invallen" do show consonance, as both words contain the same consonant combinations (LVNG). Consonance is when consecutive words or syllables have the same consonant sound. In this case, "voorlegt" and "invallen" both have the "LVNG" sound, creating a similar pattern and making these words more pleasing to the ear.</s>
fonds, fanatische, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fonds-fanatische" show consonance. 

Consonance is a poetic device in which consecutive or closely grouped sounds, especially those of the same sort, are either similar or, less often, dissimilar. In this example, the sequence of consonant sounds - "f" "o" "n" "d" "s" and "f" "a" "n" "a" "t" "i" "c" "h" "e" - has matching consonant sounds that create a pleasing, repeated pattern in the two words. Although the vowel sounds "o" and "a" are similar, they are not identical, but the pattern of the consonants creates a smooth continuation of the word in each word "fonds" and "fanatische." 

Therefore, it is clear that these two word are having the same pattern of sounds, indicating that the Dutch words show consonance.</s>
aanpakken, meepik, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance in the literal sense. Consonance refers to the repetition of a consonant sound or a similar pattern of consonants in words. In the given words "aanpakken" and "meepik," there is no such consonant repetition or pattern that could be referred to as consonance.

However, it is possible that the use of "aanpakken" (to grasp) and "meepik" (a type of bird) resembles poetic consonance found in metaphorical use. The words convey different meanings (pursuits and a bird species) and do not literally share any consonant similarity, making them less likely to be considered examples of literal consonance.

To determine if a given phrase or set of words show true poetic consonance, considering not just the sound of single consonants but also the overall sound of the words and how they are arranged and stressed, would be necessary. Such an analysis would better capture the kind of consonance being sought in the context of poetic language.</s>
etnisch, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-ingestort" show consonance.

In this example, the two Dutch words "etnisch" and "ingestort" share a structured repetition of consonant sounds. Both words end in the consonant "-s," and the first word, "etnisch," has the repeated consonant sound at the word's core, making it a pattern of repetition of consonant sounds known as consonance.</s>
duivelsklauwen, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. The word "duivelsklauwen" (devil's claws) and the word "zenuwpijn" (nerve pain) share three consonant sounds in common: 'v' sounds in "devil" and "pain," 's' sound in "devil's," and 'n' sound at the end. Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when two or more words in a series or text share the same or similar consonant sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds contribute to the rhythmic and linguistic pattern of the words, making the phrases sound more pleasant and rhyming to a certain extent. Consonance often creates a soothing, musical effect when used effectively in language, which is evident in these words.</s>
jut, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-statica" show consonance.

Consonance occurs when the same consonant sound appears at the end of consecutive words, a phenomenon that helps to create a musicality of language and enhances the poetry. In the given Dutch words "jut-statica," the final letter of each word is a consonant, which contributes to the sense of consonance or rhythmic quality found in poetry.</s>
meridionaal, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal-wegdruip" show consonance. 

In this case, the word "meridionaal" contains the letters "d," "i," "o," and "r," which are all present in the word "wegdruip." This form of repeated consonants creates a sonic effect that can contribute to the overall aesthetics of the text.</s>
meeuwen, mouw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meeuwen" and "mouw" show consonance. 

In words like meeuwen (meaning "seagull" or "screech-owl" in Dutch) and mouw (meaning "sleeve" in Dutch), the final consonant sounds are "u" and "m," respectively. This creates a pleasing harmonic pattern within each word, giving them a rhythmic quality. Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in close succession, and Dutch is known for promoting this literary device in the way many languages do. By repeating the same consonant letter as the final sound in a sequence, the words create a memorable and harmonious sound that can enhance the reader's comprehension of the language.</s>
bijstanders, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In these words, the -nd and -k consonants occur at the end of each word, which creates a repeating and blending visual sound. This type of consonance is known as "consonance." 

Furthermore, the "b" (in bijstanders) and "d" (in nadook) are both palatal (cavity) consonants, and the "s" (in bijstanders) alternates in both vowels and consonants with the "n" (in nadook). This is another sign of consonance. The result is that these words create an auditory effect which is pleasing and reinforces meaning through visual imagery.</s>
duif, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In this phrase "duif-blauwbekkend," both the prefix "blauw" (meaning blue) and the word "bekkend" (meaning plunging) are used. The consonant sounds in these words also follow a similar pattern, which contributes to the consonance. The "-blauw" ending and the "-bek" sound in "bekkend" link these words together, creating an effect of onomatopoeia.</s>
evocerend, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words share the "v" consonant sound, which contributes to the similarity in the spelling and pronunciation. Evocerend features the /v/ sound at the end, while invul features the /v/ sound within the word. This shared consonant sound contributes to the aesthetic appeal and rhythmic nature of both words, making them appear similar.</s>
apartst, protesten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "apartstaan" and "protesteren" show consonance.

In this case, the word "apartstaan" (to stand apart) and "protesteren" (to protest) both have "pro-" as a recurring consonant sounding prefix, and "-sten" or "-eren" as a consonant-ending suffix. Another example of consonance can be seen in "apartheid" and "protest". These two words ending with the "t" sound and starting with the "pro" sound present a consonant-rhyme. The use of repeated consonant sounds can contribute to the musicality and rhythmic flow of the language and poetry found in Dutch language.</s>
zouterijen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words show consonance. Both begin with the same consonant (Z) and have the suffix -invul.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonantal sounds within a line of poetry. Here, the two Dutch words you provided both share the "-Z-" consonant beginning and "-iv-v-" consonant ending. This consonance pattern can contribute to the overall flow and rhythm of the language, as both words start and end with the same consonants.</s>
onwijst, nauwste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "onwijst" and "nauwste" show consonance.

To understand why, let's break down the words:

1. "onwijst" - This word can be roughly translated as "absolutely" or "quite clearly." The structure of "on" (meaning "not," "no," or "without") combined with "wijst" (meaning "pointing to") suggests a sense of direction. However, when we consider the two elements individually, they share the affix "-wijst" that means "pointing to" or "relative to." In both instances, the word has the general meaning of something that points to or stands in relation to a certain subject. This combination of elements contributes to the sense of point/reference and consonance in the phrase.

2. "nauwste" - This word can be translated to "closest" or "most intimate." It also shares the suffix "-ste," which signifies the degree or intensity of something. In the context of the phrase, both "onwijst" and "nauwste" connect directly and with emphasis, implying a close relationship or similarity between the two aspects of the subject. This structural consonance contributes to the overall consonance in the phrase.

In conclusion, although the meanings of "onwijst" and "nauwste" are different, they share the suffix "-ste," which creates a consonance in their structure. This consonance in words and structure contributes to their ability to create a cohesive and
kielvlak, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

Both words, "kielvlak" (meaning "beach") and "handicaprace" (meaning "handicapped race"), have common consonants. The presence of "k" and "c" in each word is the basis of their similarity, resulting in consonance. Furthermore, the word patterns in each word contribute to the overall effect.</s>
Jut, crisisteam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch word "crisisteam" is indeed showing consonance with the word "Jut-". In this context, both words share the same vowel sequence - 'j-u-t' and 'c-r-i-s-i-s-t-e-a-m', while the other letters have a 't' sound at the beginning of each word. So, the consonance appears.</s>
kielvlak, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "kielvlak" and "nadook" show consonance.

The justification for this answer is as follows:
- Both words contain "-la-" and "-do-" suffixes that sound similar.
- The initial vowels "k" and "n" are pronounced similarly in those words.
- The words also share consonants, such as "k" as "c," "i" as "ee," and "-v" as "-v."

In conclusion, the given Dutch words "kielvlak" and "nadook" show consonance because of the similar sounding endings, shared initial consonants, and pronounced similar consonants.</s>
zenuwpijn, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn-radende" show consonance. 

In the words "zenuwpijn-radende," you can notice a rhyme scheme of "Z-P-N" and "R-D," which is a form of consonance. This pattern occurs because of the similarities in certain consonant sounds between the first and third syllables (ending with "Z-P" in "zenuwpijn" and "R-D" in "radende"), as well as the consonant sounds occurring at the end of each word ("N" and "D," respectively).</s>
duif, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Between "duif" (dove) and "statica" (static), the -f (voiced bilabial stop) sound is present in both words while the -st (voiced velar plosive) sound is present in "statica" at the end. This is a common pattern in poetry and language where letters or sounds are repeated and arranged to create a musical effect, known as consonance.</s>
gekaaide, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'gekaaide-taswoning' show consonance. Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when words with similar consonant sounds are placed near each other in a sentence, rhythm, or phrase. In this phrase, words like "gekaaide," which means "worn-out," and "taswoning," which means "desk drawer," have similar consonant sounds (k and ch, and t and s).</s>
duivelsklauw, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance because both words have similar endings (-klauw and -ul), which create a consonant pattern. This consonant pattern could also be seen as a form of alliteration, as both words start with the same sound. Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in the same line or rhyme scheme, while alliteration is the repetition of consonant sounds in the same word, phrase, or line.</s>
flepten, flopt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "flepten-flopt" show consonance because they both end with the same consonant sound, which contributes to a sense of unity and cohesion in the word pair.

Flepten and flopt are cognates, meaning they derive from a common root or source. Flepten is the plural form of 'flept' (which in this case seems to be an informal or incorrect spelling of the word 'flep,' which is a Dutch slang term for a mastiff, similar to 'puppy'). Both 'flep' and 'flepten' sound like they end with the same consonant, which is 't.' Consequently, this similarity in spelling and pronunciation contributes to the consonance.

Additionally, the two words' relationship as derivatives of a shared base suggests a closer semantic relationship. Therefore, the consonance between flepten and flopt aids in the perception of unity and coherence in these two Dutch words.</s>
jatten, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words show consonance because each pair of words ends with the same two consonant sounds (j and t, in the words "jatten" and "voorlegt"). Consonance is a figure of speech in which like consonant sounds are repeated in the same line of verse or the same syllable in the same word, or in the following word within the same sentence. For example, "the flute quenched the blaze, the flute quenched the blaze" and "the flute quenched the blaze, the flute quenched the blaze." In word-to-word translation, the first part of the sentence is "Jatten snapt," which means "Jatten grasps," while the second part is "Jatten snapt," which also means "Jatten grasps." Both parts end with the same two consonant sounds (j and t). Therefore, it shows consonance in the words.</s>
framepjes, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "framepjes-ontroomt" show consonance, specifically in the "t" sound.

The two words "framepjes-ontroomt" have both consonants present within their respective word structures. In the first word, "framepjes," the "-tr-" sound can be heard between the "p" and the "j," as well as the "-m-" sound in "pjes." The second part of the word, "ontroomt," also consists of consonants: "ont-" and "roomt."

Together, these consonants create a pattern that may be considered consonance, as they occur in a similar pattern in both words.</s>
lonten, leunt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "lonten-leunt" show consonance.

In linguistics, consonance is a poetic technique used to achieve a pleasing effect for listeners and speakers by bringing attention to the consonantal sounds in a sequence of words or parts of words. In this instance, the words "lonten-leunt" (meaning "tolls-sway") have two consecutive consonant-vowel-consonant syllables (l-o-n, t-e-n), making the consonance between the words noticeable.</s>
piepjongst, jatte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words show consonance because both words end in the same consonants (in this case, "tt" in "piepjongst" and "jatte").</s>
piepjongst, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst-evocerend" do show consonance.

In this sentence, the consonant sounds in both words are similar: "p-j-s-n-t" in "piepjongst" and "v-k-r-n" in "evocerend". So, they create a rhyme effect, which adds to the overall structure and sound of the words. Congsonance in Dutch is similar to consonance in other languages and is often used to create musical phrases. This creates a poetic effect by emphasizing particular vowels or consonant sounds, like in this sentence. So, yes, you can say these words show consonance.</s>
piepjongste, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongste" and "esthetica" show consonance. Both words share the same consonant pattern, which can be found in several positions in each word, such as j, p, t, and s in "pi", "e", "j", "e", "s", and "k", respectively. This repetition of consonants contributes to the consonance between the two words.</s>
etnisch, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-blauwbekkend" show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds in words close together within a phrase or a sentence. In this case, the words ending in "-kkend" (which is the Dutch word for "end" or "ending") create a repeated rhythm, contributing to the consonance of the phrase "etnisch-blauwbekkend."</s>
feilt, flute, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words 'feilt-flute', the '-t-' sound in 'feilt' and '-t-' sound in 'flute' both end with a 't' sound. This consonant sound is present in both syllables, which contributes to the overall similar sound of the two words and creates a sense of consonance.</s>
jut, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance in the Dutch words jut-voorlegt. They share the common consonant pattern "-j-t-v-r-", which creates a pleasing and predictable sound.</s>
zondagssluiting, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Based on my knowledge, the given Dutch words zondagsluiting (Sunday closing) and treknet (tug network) do not show consonance.

Consonance, in English poetry, refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning or ending of words or syllables. To determine if the words do show consonance, you would need to look for repeating consonant sounds between syllables and possibly the end of a word.

However, in Dutch, the consonance concept is more complex and involves not only the repetition of consonant sounds but also the phonetic pattern created in the words. Dutch often follows rules such as alliteration, rhyme, and onomatopoeia, rather than just specific consonance rules that apply to English poetry. 

Hence, based on the above contextual understanding, let’s conclude that these two words do not really have the same consonance structure or phonetic patterns.</s>
doodsprentjes, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "doodsprentjes" and "statica" are showing consonance.

Justification: The presence of many similar consonant sounds or shapes in neighboring letters helps to create a sense of rhythm and balance in Dutch words, especially when they are stressed. This is known as consonance. "Doodsprentjes" and "statica" both have a similar consonance pattern involving the sounds "d", "p", "r", "t", and "s", which help to create a sense of harmony between the two words.</s>
planimetreer, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
Jut, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'Jut-bagatellen' show consonance, as several letters appear in the same position in both words. The 'j' and the '-' appear in the same positions in both words, and the 'u' and the '-' are also present in the same positions. Additionally, the '-' appears frequently in Dutch words.</s>
kelk, koelakken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kelk" (cup) and "koelakken" (callow) show consonance. Both words have nearly identical consonant sounds; specifically, they both begin with the consonant cluster "kk" and have a similar structure. This consonant match in the two words is an example of consonance in language.</s>
wegdruip, generaalsepauletten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'wegdruip' and 'generaalsepauletten' show consonance. The word 'wegdruip' has similar consonants and 'g' and 's' are different consonants in the word 'generaalsepauletten'.</s>
funds, fijntes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "funds-fijntes" show consonance.

Justification:
Consonance is a rhetorical device in which the onset of a word is repeated at the end of the next word, resulting in a pleasing musical effect. In the phrase `funds-fijntes`, both words have the onset of the letter "f" followed by a different vowel consonant, which creates consonance. This device can create a rhythmic pattern, making it easier for readers or listeners to memorize or pronounce the word.</s>
kielvlak, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "ontduik" show consonance, as they both end in the consonant "k." This consonance provides a harmonious and consistent pattern within the words, making them sound more like a unit.</s>
arena, ruin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words show consonance. Both words start with two consecutive consonant sounds, "a" and "r." This phenomenon of two or more words having similar consonant sounds and sometimes also vowels is known as consonance.</s>
psychoanalytici, kelderdeur, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici" and "kelderdeur" show consonance. 

Consonance is when words with similar consonant sounds are used together, and in this case, the "-a-" sound is quite close across both words. Furthermore, the "-l-" sound in "kelderdeur" is also an "-l-" sound, which makes for a nice flow. So while it may not follow the strictest definition of consonance (where you would have two words with the same vowel sounds), it still demonstrates a similarity in the consonant sounds and results in a pleasing, almost musical, rhythm.</s>
wegdruip, gelukzoekster, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you mentioned show consonance.

The word ' Wegdruip ' and ' Gelukzoekster ' share the same consonant sound (G) before transitions to different vowel sounds. Both words show consonance in the sequence of sounds, making them both more harmonious in a written or verbal context</s>
kruis, kras, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kaarsen, kruis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "kaarsen" and "kruis", the consonant sounds "s" and "rs" (respectively) share the same consonant. Consonance is a figure of speech where the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of verse or a group of words helps to create rhythm and stress patterns. In this case, using the same consonant sound between the two words creates a musical effect and contributes to the rhyme scheme.</s>
wil, wal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wil-wal" show consonance. The justification for this statement is that the Dutch language, like many others, has a feature called consonance where consecutive consonants, vowels, or consonant clusters in a word that have a similar sound, appear together in the word again. In the words "wil-wal," the similar "w" consonant sound occurs first and secondly, causing the words to show consonance.</s>
pleitte, peult, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. The words "pleitte-peult" share a common suffix (-te-peult), but the initial components ("pleitte" and "peult") don't share any sounds that are similar or pleasing when pronounced together.</s>
handicaprace, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance between the Dutch words "handicaprace-zenuwpijn." 

Consonance is a poetic device that occurs when consecutive vowel sounds (like "ee" or "oo") in a word are followed by identical or closely related vowel sounds in a neighboring word. In this case, "race" and "zenuw" (which roughly translates to "nerve" in English) both have the "ee" vowel sound, and "pijn" (which roughly translates to "pain" in English) follows it, creating a sense of rhythm and similarity in the word sequence.</s>
vadervreugden, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'vadervreugden' and 'esthetiek' show consonance.

Justification:

'Consonance' is a concept in poetry where two or more words share the same or similar consonant sounds. In the given Dutch words, 'vader' and 'esthetiek', both share the /e/ consonant sound, while 'vreugden' shares the /v/ consonant sound. These similar consonant sounds create a harmonious effect when spoken or read, making these words appear more similar and rhythmic.</s>
lal, lila, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
vesten, vast, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In this example, there are two Dutch words: 'vesten' and 'vast.' Despite the difference in spelling and the fact that 'vast' does not show consonance with 'vesten,' both words share a similar structure and sound.

These words have a V-s-C consonance pattern, where 'vesten' (vests) contains a voiceless affricate 'Ts,' and 'vast' (firm, strong) has a voiced affricate 'Ts.' This consonance pattern makes both words sound similar and creates a sense of relationship or connection between them, adding to their shared meaning.</s>
salet, sleedt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "salet" and "sleedt" show consonance. 

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds within a word to create a musical effect, so when these two words are presented together, even if some vowel sounds are slightly different, the overall effect of consonant sounds is similar. In this case, both words end with the same two consonant sounds, which create a sense of rhythmic coherence and create an auditory pattern in the phrase.</s>
zouterijen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because they both contain a "t" sound in the middle, which shares the same consonant group. In this case, "t" in "zouterijen" (Salt farms) and "t" in "nadook" (wrench) both correspond to the same sound. This makes the words sound similar and create a consonant-based rhythm in the phrases.</s>
joysticks, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance in the Dutch words "joysticks" and "detacheer." Both words share the consonant "j" and "t."</s>
aanspoel, inspelen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aanspoel" and "inspelen" show consonance. Both words end with the sounds "spl" and "peln," respectively. Consonance occurs when like consonant sounds are repeated in succession without a vowel sound in between, in this case the "l" consonant sound.</s>
oestrus, struise, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is a consonance present in the words 'oestrus' and 'struise.' Both words share the element 'ss,' indicating a shared or similar consonant sound. The word 'oestrus' is the Latin word for luteal phase of a woman's menstrual cycle, while 'struise' is the Dutch word for sturgeon or a similar type of fish.</s>
preekten, prikt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || To determine whether the Dutch words "preekten-prikt" show consonance, I will analyze the patterns of consonant clusters in each word.

1. "Preekten" consists of two syllables: pre-ek-ten. The consonant clusters in this word are "pre," "ek," and "ten."

2. "Prikt" is a single syllable with the consonant cluster "prik."

Analyzing the consonant clusters between the two words, they share the "prik-" cluster in the word for "Prikt." However, they do not share any other consonant cluster other than that. 

Therefore, I would say that the Dutch words "preekten-prikt" show only minimally or weakly consonance, as both words share only one consonant cluster.</s>
Jut, antwoordend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
plantluis, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "esthetiek" show consonance. 

Consonance can be defined as the repetition of consonant sounds at the ending of words or within words in close proximity to each other. In this case, both words end with the consonant "t" sound - "t" in "plant" and "t" in "luis" and "t" in "est". So, there is a consonance present between the endings of these two words. Additionally, the second word, "esthetiek," starts with the same consonant sound ("s" in "esthetiek") that was repeated at the end of the first word, "plantluis". This adds to the overall consonance in the phrase.</s>
attentie, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in a sequence of syllables to create a rhythm or musical effect. Here, Dutch words 'attentie' (pay attention) and 'kreupelbossen' (weeping forests) do not have obvious consonant repetitions or similar consonant combinations to be considered for consonance. Instead, they present distinct features such as the first word having a vowel sound, followed by consonants, and the second word consisting of consonants only.</s>
potteus, oppoetsen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. The words "potteus-oppoetsen" consist of the following consonant combinations: 

- "potteus" has "tt", "pp" and "ss" which is consonance.
- "oppoetsen" has "pp" and "ss" which again is a form of consonance.

However, when put together "potteus-oppoetsen" lacks consonance as it doesn't exhibit a consistent sound pattern across all vowel or consonant letters. For a word to be considered consonant, it should have elements that harmonize and resonate in sound. Hence, the two words 'potteus' and 'oppoetsen' don't show consonance when put together.</s>
etteren, teer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words you provided, "etteren-teer," show a degree of consonance. Although the words themselves do not share identical sounds, there are certain recurring consonant sounds that create a subtle consonance between the two words.

The consonance can be observed as follows:

1. Both words start with the letter "t," creating a common consonant sound to begin with.
2. The second word "etteren" includes the consonant "r," which appears twice in "teer" at the end.
3. The letter "r" appears twice in the word "etteren," too, in addition to the "rr" phonetical formation in "teer."

While not entirely identical in sound, these common consonants contribute to a slight degree of consonance between the words "etteren-teer."</s>
ritmeren, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "ritmeren-invul" show consonance. They both have the "r" and "n" sounds, followed by vowels, which are also present in the "i" and "u" sounds. This creates a smooth flow of syllables and rhythm in the words.</s>
voorlieg, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "voorlieg" and "navel," indeed show consonance as both words have the consonants "v-b-l" in them. The word "voorlieg" translates to "before," and the word "navel" translates to the indentation at the waist on a living creature. The -v-b-l sound pattern, found in both the initial vowel and the final consonant of both words, is an important characteristic of the Dutch language known as consonance. It adds a pleasing resonance or rhythm to language that is characteristic of Dutch poetry.</s>
dellen, deal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "dellen" and "deal" show consonance due to the repetition of the "l" sound. This concept of using similar or repeated sounds to link words, known as consonance, is a literary device used to emphasize and harmonize the words in a sentence. In this case, the word "l" is repeated in both words, creating a harmonious relationship between them.

In Dutch, there are words with similar sounds that could be used to create a consonant scheme, such as:
1. Hallen (hall) and mallen (bales of fabric).
2. Gallen (gall) and hallen (halls).
3. Kallen (call) and pallen (boxes).

Due to these linguistic similarities, the word "dellen" (dollars) and the word "deal" (a transaction, an agreement, or a bargain) when combined can elicit an aural connection through their "l" sound, creating a sense of visual and auditory harmony.</s>
voorlieg, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlieg" and "vadervreugde" exhibit consonance due to their shared pattern of [v]-[v]-[r]-[d]-[d] sounds in the middle of the words. This type of consonance is known as a "trill" or "geminate consonant" and is a common phonetic feature in Dutch. It contributes to the music and flow of the language while also making the words distinct and recognizable to Dutch speakers.</s>
koppelend, kuipplant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koppelend-kuipplant" show consonance. 

In this case, the word "koppelend" and "kuipplant" are homonyms. Both words feature the same initial consonant clusters "k-k," which contributes to the consonance. Additionally, the word "koppelend" is a compound word composed of two words, "koppel" (hook) and "end" (meaning 'end' or 'connection'), while "kuipplant" can be translated to "airplant", which is a plant commonly used as a desk decoration and propagation tool. The fact that the compound word "koppelend" is made of two related words that share the initial consonant cluster "k-k" strengthens the case for consonance between the two words "koppelend-kuipplant."</s>
kloek, kelk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kloek-kelk" show consonance, specifically homorganic consonance. Homorganic consonance involves identical consonant sounds (homorgans) in neighboring syllables, which creates a sense of rhythm and harmony in the language. In the given phrase, the /k/ sound is found in both syllables, causing the consonance effect.</s>
oploken, pluk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "oploken-pluk" show consonance, as both words share the sound of the consonants "p" and have a similar shape when written, with the repeated letter "l". This type of repetition can give the words a pleasing, rhythmic quality, which is a characteristic of consonance.</s>
attentie, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In this case, both words have similar consonant sounds, as "attentie" (attention) and "kwintalen" (quarter) contain consecutive consonant clusters: "t" and "n", "t" and "k", "k" and "w", "w" and "n", "n" and "t", "t" and "e", "e" and "w", "w" and "i", "i" and "n", "n" and "t", "t" and "e", "e" and "q", and "q" and "u". These consonant clusters result in a rhythmic and harmonious flow between the two words.</s>
plantluis, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words show consonance in that they have similar consonant sounds at the ends of the words: "plant" and "luis" in "plantluis" and "versvoeten." This creates a rhythm and flow in the phrases.</s>
fietsen, fatisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
voorlieg, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Voorlieg-indoken is made up of the following elements:
- Voorlieg (in Dutch, it means "appear" or "arise")
- Indoken (in Dutch, it means "step down" or "decrease")

Upon examining the components of the word, it can be seen that they don't share any overlapping consonant sounds; they primarily use different consonant clusters, such as "l" in "voorlieg" and "n" in "indoken."

Consonance is a poetic technique where there is a repetition of consonant sounds in a line of poetry. Here, these Dutch words do not share any overlapping consonant sounds, so there is no consonance found between them.</s>
avondfeesten, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the consonance between the Dutch words "avondfeesten-voorlieg" is not particularly strong. 

The Dutch language has many elements of consonance, whether it be word-final consonances (such as the 'n' in "avondfeesten") or consonants that cluster together at the end of words ("voorlieg-" clusters at the end of both words). However, in this case, there is not a clear consonance occurring between the words.

In this specific case, there is no clear consonant that connects "avondfeesten" to "voorlieg" and vice versa. Each word has its own distinct set of consonants that make it distinct from the other.</s>
belaadt, bult, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "belaadt" and "bult" both show some consonance, consonance being a pattern of similarity of consonant sounds in words. In this case, the similar consonant sounds between the two words are the "b-" sounds in the beginning of each word. However, it is important to note that consonance can occur between vowel sounds as well as consonant sounds, which the given words do not show.</s>
jut, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. Although both words have the same number of letters, jut and verlegd, they do not share any consonant clusters (sequences of two or more consonant letters that sound the same) that would make them consonantically similar. The first word has "j" and "v" that sound distinctly different, while the second word has the consonant "l" followed by the distinctly different "r" and "d" sounds.</s>
chaotischt, gidsten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "chaotischt-gidsten" show consonance. 

Consonance is when two adjacent words in a literary line sound similar in terms of consonant sound. In these words, the sequence of consonants at the end of each word includes three consecutive consonants: "t" in chaos, "ch" in chaotisch, and "t" in gids. This makes the words "chaotischt-gidsten" harmonious and creates a musicality to them.</s>
y-assen, ace, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "y-assen-ace" show consonance as the consecutive sounds at the end of each syllable are the same: /-a/ both in "assen" and "ace".</s>
doorsta, drieste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "doorsta-drieste" show consonance, as they both contain a shared consonant (st), starting with the same syllable (-sta) and ending with the same consonant (drieste).</s>
rans, rijns, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Consonance is a rhetorical technique in poetry that involves repetition of consonant sounds. Both "rans" and "rijns" in the given Dutch words have a "s" sound after a consonant, which creates consonance. These sounds can be found in the words "ran" and "rins" separately, which are often used together to make up the words "rans" and "rijns" in Dutch.</s>
vuilpersleiding, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words show consonance because both words start with the letter "v," and end with the letter "o." This consonance creates a pattern and helps create a similarity between the two words, thus making it easier to remember and understand the connection between them.</s>
voorlig, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. Consonance refers to patterns of consonant sounds in words that do not include vowels. In this case, the pattern found in "voorlig-vadervreugden" consists of the consonants "v" and "r", but there are no two occurrences of the same consonant sound together in either word.</s>
ontruimt, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because they both contain the trending consonant pattern "t" followed by "s" ("t-s" pattern), as in:

- "ontruimt" (emptied out)
- "esthetiek" (aesthetics)

This consonance contributes to the overall sound and rhythm of the words, making them more pleasing to the ear.</s>
accuraatst, kortste, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || As an AI language model, I can analyze the given Dutch words and determine if there is consonance between the two words.

- "Accuraatst": This word consists of "accurate -st" which is a double suffix forming a plural noun in Dutch. The endings -acurate (from English) and -st (from Latin -tus) have the same sounds (-kw), making "accurate" sound like "acco-urate". This gives an almost identical consonant sequence in both words.

- "Kortste": This word consists of "shortest" which is a direct translation from English, and "te" which changes "est" to an adjective ending in Dutch (as in English). The consonant sequence "ortte" stays the same, making the second word also show a close consonant sequence in comparison to "acco-urate".

In conclusion, both words, accuraatst and kortste, show a high degree of consonance as they both have a near identical consonant sequence. Therefore, the answer is yes.</s>
duivelsklauwen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "duivelsklauwen" (devil's claws) and "invul" (incomplete, unfulfilled) do not show consonance, as they present different patterns and structures in their respective vocabularies.

Consonance occurs when like consonant sounds are found consecutively in words. In "duivelsklauwen", the following consonant sounds are present: -v-, -l-, -k-, -a-, -w-, -n-. In "invul", the following consonant sounds are present: -n-, -v-, -l- (twice), -u-, -l-.

Since there are no consecutive occurrences of like consonant sounds, these words do not exhibit consonance.</s>
ontsmet, antisemieten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontsmet" and "antisemieten" do show consonance, as they both end with similar consonant sounds - "s" and "m." Consonance, in poetry, is the repetition of a consonant sound or a vowel sound pattern, often creating a pleasing or effective literary effect.</s>
roken, roekoe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance in the Dutch words. Both words "roken" and "roekoe" contain two similar consonant sounds in the middle: "k" in "roken" ("rook") and "r" in "roekoe" ("rok"). This creates a pattern of similar consonant sounds, known as consonance.</s>
trompetboom, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompetboom-aanvijl" show consonance as they have similar consonant sounds at the end of the words.

- "trompet" and "boom" both end in the consonant sound of "t" (as in "hot"), which creates a sense of consonance between the two words.
- "aanvijl" and "trompet" both end in the consonant sound of "t" (as in "hot"), which creates a sense of consonance between the two words.</s>
overaccentuering, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "overaccentuering" and "nadook" show consonance, as they have identical consonant clusters at the end of the words. In this case, the consonant clusters are "V" and "K" in each word.</s>
negerwijk, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
ontruimt, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
jatte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In linguistics, consonance is often defined as the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words, phonemes, or syllables. Both "jatte" and "nadook" have the same consonant sound "tt", which contributes to their phonetic and rhythmic consonance when combined. This can be an aesthetically pleasing feature of language and can be appreciated in poetry and poetry appreciation. Consonance can also be a technique used by poets, such as when they make use of this feature to enhance the poem's overall effect.</s>
wangklieren, wijnkleur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "wangklieren" (throat lining) and "wijnkleur" (wine color), the consonants 'w' and 'k' are repeated in similar positions, indicating a pattern of consonance. This is a common literary device used to create musicality and emphasize sounds in the language.</s>
psychoanalytici, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance as they have no repeated consonants.

"psychoanalytici" and "naduiken" are both compound words in Dutch, featuring two different vocabulary items sewn together. "psychoanalytici" is borrowed from English and is a term for "psychological analysis," specifically in the field of psychoanalysis. "naduiken" means "bathe" or "take a bath" in Dutch, and it contains the verb roots "nau" (meaning 'to be near or to surround', indicating a movement) and "uiken" (meaning 'to wet' or 'to bath', indicating an action). Therefore, these words do not follow the consonance pattern in Dutch language, whereby consecutive letters of the same sound consistently repeat, and are an example of a word's constituent parts being sewn together in a non-repeating consonant pattern.</s>
omrol, amorele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "omrol" and "amorele" show consonance because both words have the same sequence of consonant sounds, specifically /r/. However, this consonance does not follow the normal rules of Dutch language structure, making it less pronounced as a sound feature.</s>
kielvlakken, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "kielvlakken-taswoning" do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in the proximity of vowels in words. Here, the words "kielvlakken" and "taswoning" do not share any consonant sounds that appear near vowels. The words are distinct in terms of both structure and pronunciation, which is why they do not show consonance.</s>
force, afrees, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance. The Dutch words "force" and "afrees" do not display consistent consonant patterns, making it impossible to identify harmony between the sounds of the words.</s>
Jut, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-liefdesgevoelens" show consonance.

In the given Dutch phrase "Jut-liefdesgevoelens," the word "Jut" has the same first and last consonants - "J" and "s". This creates a certain rhyme and sense of balance, which is known as consonance. Additionally, the Dutch word "liefdesgevoelens" consists of consonant clusters such as "lief" (love) and "sgevoelens" (sense of emotions), contributing to the overall consonance in the word.</s>
schijt, schatte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Both words, "schijt" and "schatte," have the same root word, "schatten," which means "to hoard" or "to treasure." The similarities in the word structure and ending -ette, as well as the similar sounds of the consonants, contribute to the sense of consonance present in these Dutch words.</s>
rotacisme, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rotacisme-voorlieg" show consonance as both words start with the letters "r" and have "-e-" in the second and third syllables, which is a common consonantal pattern in Dutch. The consonance between the two words creates stronger rhythmic unity and enhances the overall sound of the phrase.</s>
bijstanders, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. The two words, 'bijstanders' and 'indeuk', share similar consonant groups in their beginnings and in the end, creating a pleasing and satisfying visual effect.</s>
duif, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words exhibit consonance. 

The word "duif" has similar consonant sounds at the beginning and end of the word. The "d" in the first syllable contrasts with the "f" in the second syllable, creating consonance. Similarly, the ending "iek" of the word "esthetiek" shares the same consonant sounds as the ending "if" in the word "duif," also showing consonance.

Consonance is a poetic device in which the repetition of consonant sounds within a line or between lines draws the reader's attention to those sounds, emphasizing their meaning and impact on the overall structure of the text.</s>
deal, dal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "deal" (English) and "dal" (Dutch) have a similar sounding ending, which is "al". Therefore, they share consonance, and you can perceive a connection between the phonetic features of these words. 

It's important to note that consonance is the rhyming or repetition of certain sound patterns, not just the ending sounds. The consonance in deal-dal occurs due to the repetition of the consonant sounds at the end of each word, not the vowel sounds.</s>
naduiken, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "naduiken" and "sciopticons" show consonance.</s>
kickt, kookten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds within a line or phrase, usually at the end of words. In the given words "kickt-kookten," the last letters of the first and second words have different consonant sounds - "k" in "kickt" and "k" in "kookten" - thus no consonance is present.</s>
curator, karteer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words show consonance, which is a similar pattern of consonant sounds in a sequence in nearby syllables. In this case, "curator-karteer" has a similar consonant pattern: 'k' is in both words, 'r' is in both words, and '-teer' is present in both words.</s>
midden, midi, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "midden-midi" do not show consonance. The words are "midden" (center) and "midi" (short for "midjournié," meaning "mid journey"). The -m- and -d- sounds both appear in different vowel positions and are not repeated consonantly in the same words.</s>
geruste, gerst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
paleize, poolzee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "paleize" and "poolzee" show consonance. These words share two consonant clusters, "pxl" and "zz", which creates a sense of musicality and rhythm in these phrases. Consonance is a figure of speech that involves two or more words, syllables or entire phrases, having the same consonant sounds, and can add a sense of unity, flow, and rhythm to a piece of language.</s>
tachisme, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words tachisme and statica do not show consonance. Consonance is when like consonant sounds appear in proximity to each other, usually in the same syllable or near-syllable position.

In the given Dutch words, tachisme is a term from the visual arts that combines the words 'tachy' for fast and 'ism' for an artistic movement or theory, and statica, on the other hand, refers to static or unchanging things. There is no consonance present in these words, as they are two separate terms that don't share any similar consonant sounds.</s>
avondfeesten, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "avondfeesten-voorlicht" do show consonance, as both words share some consonant characters: "fes" in "feesten" and "vo" in "voorlicht." This creates a phonetic similarity, which contributes to the consonance effect between the words. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry, usually creating a musical and/or rhythmic quality.</s>
toerekent, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words you provided show consonance.

To explain this further, let me break down each word:

1. "toerekent" consists of two syllables: "t" (as in "table") and "oer" (which has a lengthened "o"). The two are separated by "-".
2. "-legt" is the same as "leg" (both as in "legume").

So, while you may say that there's no exact meaning overlap between these two words, it's the consonant similarities that create the consonance. The common consonants here are t, l, and e. Hence, these words indeed show consonance.</s>
psychoanalytici, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. The words "psychoanalytici-ontdekken" does not exhibit any consistent consonant sounds. The word "psychoanalytici" (psychological analysis) consists of a pair of words separated by a hyphen. "Ontdekken" (to discover) is the verb, and its present participle "ontdekken" shows consonance. To create consonance, the consonant sounds in word pair need to be repeated or similar in a consistent manner, which is not the case with these words.</s>
eesten, st, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "eesten" and "st" show consonance. This word play is found in Flemish poetry, and consonance is a rhetorical device used to create visual similarity between words that have similar sounds but are spelled differently. For example, in "eesten," the first three vowels are combined with the "n" sound of "een," creating the same sound. This technique enhances the rhythm and music of the language.</s>
clip, kleppen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "clip-kleppen" show consonance. The word contains multiple syllables, and has two consonant sequences which follow a specific pattern (CCV), where C is a consonant and V is a vowel. In this case, the two consonants that follow the vowel 'p' are 'l' (in 'kleppen') and the single consonant 'p' again. This type of word structure is often referred to as "palindromic" or "consonant chaining".</s>
navel, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "navel-esthetica" show consonance. 

The reason is because in "navel", the "n", "v", "l" and "-" have similar sounds, and "navel-esthetica" could also be seen as having some degree of consonance since the words "navel" and "esthetica" have a similar musical flow when pronounced. However, it's not an exact consonance due to the hyphen separating "navel" and "esthetica".</s>
framepjes, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

The words "framepjes" contain many similar consonant sounds, such as the 'p' and 's', and the words "indeuk" also share these consonants. Consonance is a literary device where words with similar consonant sounds are grouped together, often for emphasis, rhythm, or effect. It can vary in pronunciation, meaning, and spelling, and in this case, these words have many similar consonant sounds which create a sense of consonance in the sentence.</s>
iemker, micro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'iemker' and 'micro' show consonance. 

Consonance refers to a parallelism between consonant sounds in the same line of poetry, song, or phrase. In this case, both 'iemker' and 'micro' feature the consonant 'm', which can be argued as a form of consonance due to the two words sharing a similar sound pattern. Consonance can add rhythmic flow and emphasis to language, making it an important feature of certain styles of poetry and spoken word forms.</s>
fis, fessen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fis-fessen" show consonance. The repetition of the "ss" sound in the second word contributes to the overall similarity of the words, making them appear more harmonious in the context.</s>
koelkamer, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koelkamer" and "detacheer" do show consonance. The reason for this is that both words share two letter-sounds that appear as consonants, "K" and "T", followed by a Vowel Sound and then a consonant "M" in "koelkamer" and "D" in "detacheer". Therefore, they are quite alike when it comes to their consonant sounds. But it has to be noted that, they are also different in meaning.</s>
luchtten, laagt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Justification: 
In the words "luchtten-laagt," the ending "-laagt" is repeated, and though it sounds different ("laagt" means "low" and is pronounced with a slightly different intonation), it has the same underlying sounds (LT). This is the definition of consonance in poetry or linguistics.
So, the syllables "luch" and "ten" consonate.</s>
jatten, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatten-zondagssluiting" show consonance.

Justification:
Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of multiple words within a line of poetry. In the given phrase "jatten-zondagssluiting", the endings of the words (the consonants) both start with "t" and "s". This repetition of consonants is what makes the phrase show consonance.</s>
cheffinnen, chiffon, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words within a sentence or a poem. 

cheffinnen (chef-fin, 'chief ladies') has a vowel sound (fin) at the end, while 

chiffon (cheffon) has a consonant sound (ffin) at the end. Therefore they do not display consonance.</s>
peult, poelt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "peult-poelt" shows consonance.

Consonance occurs when consecutive vowel sounds are the same or similar in a word. In this case, both words, "peult" and "poelt," have similar consonants as both words end with the consonant "lt". This can make the word sound more musical and pleasing to the ear.</s>
voorlieg, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlieg-ingestelde" show consonance. The '-e' in both words, combined with the '-ingestel-e' sound and the '-de' ending, create a pattern of similar consonant sounds. This creates a pleasing and rhythmic effect in the language. This phenomenon, known as "consonance," is often used in poetic language to create a musical or harmonious effect.</s>
aanzetten, inzit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words 'aanzetten' and 'inzit' show consonance. In both words, most of the letters are consonants, specifically three consonants in 'aanzetten' and three consonants in 'inzit'. This consonance adds to the rhythm and cadence of the words, making them sound similar in pronunciation.</s>
aantreed, intrad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. The words "aantreed" and "intrad" have similar consonant sounds: "t" and "d."</s>
taswoning, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

Both taswoning and tachisme end with the letter "-me," which contributes to the consonance and onomatopoeic quality in the words. Consonance is a literary device that involves the repetition of consonant sounds in neighboring or closely-spaced syllables. This technique is often used to emphasize or link ideas in a text or to create a memorable literary effect.</s>
Jut, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the given sentence "Jut-pruimenboomgaarden" (which means "plum orchards"), the consonant sounds in the words "Jut" and "boom" create a rhythmical pattern that enhances their consonance. The J and Ts in "Jut" and "Ts" in "boom" have similar consonant sounds, making them connect to create a coherent flow in the overall sentence.</s>
opslaat, absoluut, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "opslaat" and "absoluut" do show consonance. Both words share a "p" sound in the letters "p" and "s" and "t." The "a" in "absoluut" also has a similar trill to the "u" in "opslaat," creating consonance between the two nouns.</s>
jut, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Let me explain:
The Dutch language is a Germanic language derived from Proto-Germanic and shares similarities with other language families such as Latin and English. To identify consonance, the language consonant pattern must be analyzed. In your first word "jut-taswoning," the only shared consonant between the individual words is "j." However, the sound '-s' in the first word is a voiced alveolar lateral fricative, while the '-s' in the second word, "taswoning," is a voiceless postalveolar affricate. Although both end in the "-s" sound, the phonological differences render the consonance less apparent.</s>
vooreinde, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words end in the same consonant sound ( [-k]), which contributes to the overall alliteration and symmetry in the sound patterns of both words.</s>
plantluis, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not exhibit consonance. 

Consonance can be defined as the recurrence of the same consonant sounds within a word or within a line of poetry. In the pair of words you've provided, "plantluis-bekwaamden", the consonances are: 
- 'l' and 's' 
- 'b' and 'k' 

To determine consonance in these two words, you have to look at the consonants in the words, and then see how many times they repeat. Although 'l' and 's' sound the same, the words do not contain two instances of the same pair of consonants (i.e., 'l' and 's' or 'b' and 'k'). Therefore, these two words do not exhibit consonance.</s>
grossiert, grijsaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "grossiert-grijsaard" exhibit consonance.

To justify this, let's break down the words and analyze their consonant sounds:

1. "grossiert" - This word consists of three vowel sounds (AE, EH, AI) and four consonant sounds (GR, SH, R, T). 
2. "grijsaard" - This word has six vowel sounds (I~Y, I, AE, AA, AH, AD) and six consonant sounds (G, R, Z, AH, AA, R).

Comparing the consonant sounds in these two words, we can observe that "grossiert" has two pairs of consonant sounds with final -T's, while "grijsaard" has one pair of consonant sounds with a final -R. Nonetheless, having consonant repetition in both cases, the words share two common consonants "R" or "T". Hence, they exhibit consonance. It's worth noting that "grijsaard" is a compound word where "grijs"- which means "gray"- is the base word.</s>
zetterijen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

As mentioned in the definition of consonance, it involves the repetition of similar sounds or structures. In this case, both "zetterijen" and "statica" contain the consonant sound "t" and "c" in quick succession, which can be considered as a consonant pair and thus a form of consonance.</s>
kaarsen, kras, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "kaarsen" and "kras," the letters 's' and 'r' create a pattern of consonants that are repeated. This type of repetition in word structure is known as consonance. Consonance creates a rhythmic effect in language, often making the words easier to remember or enjoy. Although the words are both related to fire and light, the pattern of consonant sounds gives them a unified sound, emphasizing similarity and rhythm.</s>
kwintalen, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kwintalen-wegdruip" show consonance.

The reason for this is that both words share the sound of the letter "w" and the letter "g" in a consonant cluster, which gives the words a rhythm and similar qualities. Consonance is an important component of language and poetry, as it helps create a sense of rhythm and familiarity for the reader or listener. In this case, the repetition of "w" and "g" makes the words sound connected or similar, as they are both composed of consonant clusters and share the same consonants.</s>
pens, panisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || I'm not from the Dutch language, though the words you are comparing, 'penseel' and 'paniek' do seem to have some similar syllable structures. However, they definitely do not show perfect consonance.

- 'penseel' (pencil) starts with 'p', and ends with a long 'eel' sound, which is indeed in consonance with 'p' and 'eel'.
- 'paniek' (panic) starts with 'p', ends with a short 'a' sound, which matches the 'p' sound more than anything else.

This doesn't mean they don't show partial consonance, but they do not display perfect consonance. The Dutch language does however have a rule for consonants to be pronounced in a certain way.

In Dutch, the first vowel in a word does not affect how the second consonant is pronounced. This is why the word 'penseel' starts with 'p', but the pronunciation of 's' does not vary. This rule is similar with other Germanic languages such as English. 

So while 'penseel' and 'paniek' might not have consonance in the English sense where every second letter is the same, they do follow a similar consonant pronunciation rule in Dutch.</s>
gemeste, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Consonance is a poetic device that involves repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry. In this example, "-me-" and "-so-" do not form a pair of consonants, so the word can't be considered to show consonance.</s>
prijst, poreust, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "prijst" and "poreust" show consonance.

Consonance occurs when two or more words in a sentence or a passage have the same or similar underlying consonant sounds near the end of the word (the last vowel sound). In the given words "prijst" (praise) and "poreust" (poet) you can see that "p" and "r" are the primary consonant sounds that connect both words. This creates a pleasing onomatopoeic effect to the ear when these words are used in succession. 

However, this might not necessarily mean that these words can be used in a conversation or in a sentence structure because they don't form the typical Dutch words. "Pijst-poreust" might not be a typical Dutch phrase or word, and can make the sentence less understandable due to its foreign origin. If used in a context which connotes praising a poet, it would be a more understandable sentence.</s>
al, li, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "al-li" do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within words. In this instance, "al-li" consists of consecutive vowels (a, i). The sound between those vowels doesn't follow or match a consonant sound, so it doesn't show consonance.</s>
jut, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "jut-bagatellen" do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within syllables. In these Dutch words, "jut-bagatellen," the "-j-" and "-t-" sounds at the end of the words make them related, but they do not create a consistent consonant pattern, so consonance cannot be considered.

It's important to note that a word with a similar sound pattern but a different pronunciation doesn't necessarily qualify as consonance. For example, the English phrase "jitter bug" contains the same -jit- sound, but it doesn't fulfill the criteria for the word "jut-bagatellen."</s>
vuilpersleiding, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words show consonance.

Here's a breakdown of each word and how they share the same consonant sounds:

1. vuil (meaning "foul" or "dirty")
2. persleiding (meaning "sewerage" or "sewage system")
3. -ord
4. vuil (meaning "foul" or "dirty")
5. -de (a common suffix used in Dutch to signify "the")
6. orde (meaning "order" or "arrangement")

The only difference between these words is the presence of silent letters (i.e., "v"). So, you can hear the similar consonant sounds in the words "dirty" (vuil) and "order" (orde). Overall, these words exhibit consonance by sharing similar consonant sounds.</s>
voorlieg, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
antwoordend, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
duif, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance.

The word "duif-liefdesgevoelens" can be broken down into individual syllables: duif (dwee), liefde (lievday), and -gevoelens (gehvvay-lsans). The '-' symbol denotes a pause between the syllables.

All the vowels, 'u', 'i', 'a', 'e', 'a', 'e', and 'a', are pronounced. It is a compound word, meaning a bird of the dove species. The word "liefdesgevoelens" can be broken down as 'liefde' (meaning affection or love) with consonants 'l', 'i', 'f', 'e', 's', and 'e', followed by 'gevoelens' (meaning sensations, feelings, emotions). In both parts, consonance is present in the end of each word with the '-s-' and '-ns-' combination.</s>
goeddunkt, gedankte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "goeddunkt-gedankte" do show consonance.

Let's break down both words to better understand this phenomenon.

1. "Goe": In both words, this consonant combination occurs frequently, hence showing consonance.
2. "dunkt" and "dankt": These two consonant combinations ("d" + "k" + "t") are shared between the two words also, contributing to the consonance between them.
3. "gedanchte": Similarly, "gedaan" has a consonant combination ("d" + "a" + "n") which is shared with "dankt". 

These comparisons of consonant combinations demonstrate that both words share an affinity through the presence of consistent sounds, thus creating a sense of consonance.</s>
veerloon, voerlinnen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "veerloon" and "voerlinnen," the consonant sounds are consistent throughout. Let's break it down:

1. "veer" contains the sounds "v" and "r" (consonants), which are also found in "loon" and "linnen" respectively.
2. "loon" and "linnen" share the consonant sounds "l" and "n," which are present in "veerloon" and "voerlinnen."

Thus, "veerloon" and "voerlinnen" both demonstrate consonance since they have consistent consonant sounds.</s>
afloodt, flute, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "afloodt-flute" show consonance. 

Although the words appear dissimilar in their root word (afloodt vs. flute), they both have consistent and repeating consonant sounds, such as "f" and "l." This quality of having similar or related consonants in neighboring or nearby sounds is called consonance, and it creates a musical and pleasing effect in language.</s>
feilt, aflieten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "feilt-aflieten" show consonance. 

In this pair of words, the rhetorical figure known as consonance is present. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words or within syllables. In "feilt-aflieten," both words end in the consonant "l," which provides a pleasing pattern to the ear. The repetition of this consonant sound adds to the overall musicality of the word, making it a form of consonance.</s>
mom, Mimi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance, as both words contain the letters "m" and "i" that are similar sounding when stressed. Consonance is a figure of speech where two or more words in a phrase or a sentence have the same or similar consonant sounds, as in mom-M</s>
deeltijdbanen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

The given words have an unusual combination of vowels and consonants that make them sound similar, forming an example of consonance in Dutch.

In the phrase "deeltijdbanen-ontruimt," the '-tj-' at the beginning of "deeltijd" and 'bn-' at the end of "banen" create an irregular pattern that contributes to the sense of consonance. Also, the '-r-' ending in "ontruimt" is similar in pronunciation to the '-n-' beginning in "banen."

Similarly, in the phrase "deeltijdbanen-ontruimt," the '-tj-' at the end of "ontruimt" and the '-tj-' at the beginning of "banen" sound the same, creating another example of consonance in these two words.

Overall, the combination of irregular and similar consonants creates a harmonious sound that demonstrates consonance in these words, even though the phrases are not exact anagrams.</s>
beschietend, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beschietend" and "trompetboom" show consonance.

Here's how consonance can be identified:
1. Both words are Dutch and have similar sounding consonants: "b" in "beschietend" and "t" in "trompetboom".
2. They share similar letter combinations that have the same sound: "-ch" in "beschietend" and "-p-t" in "trompetboom".
3. Both words could be related to the concept of "noise" with "beschietend" meaning "bombardment" or "bombed" and "trompetboom" meaning "trumpet tree".</s>
hei, oho, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'hei-oho' show consonance.

Consonance is a rhetorical figure that occurs when several words that rhyme are heard in such a way that they produce a similar or consonant sound. In the Dutch words 'hei-oho', the 'h' and 'o' sound provide an auditory similarity, which contributes to the consonance effect.</s>
onecht, naoogt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Both words, "onecht" and "naoogt," have the same consonant sounds - T in "onecht" and "T" in "naoogt." In fact, it almost sounds like one continuous sound sequence, with "T" being a continuation of the sound of "onecht" just with a different vowel. Therefore, it is evident that these words show consonance.</s>
leidsel, lotuszuil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words do show consonance because both words have similar consonant sounds at the end of the words. In "leidsel" (trouble, difficult), the sound "s" is followed by two other consonants that are all pronounced in succession. In "lotuszuil" (lotus column), the "l" sound is also followed by a consonant at the end of the word. The similar ending consonant sounds in both words create a sense of unity and rhythm, which contributes to consonance.</s>
zenuwpijn, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because they both have similar consonants (z, p, n, s, l) at the end of the words, which forms a pattern and sounds consonantally similar.</s>
taswoning, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "taswoning" and "bagatellen" do show consonance.

The main technique of consonance is when there are repeated identical consonant sounds, like the "p" and "t" in "taswoning." In the second word, "bagatellen," there's an "a" sound at the end spelled out by the "t" in "taken" and "tell" and by the "n" in "tell," which also have a similar "a" sound.

In consonance, it's not just about words with the same consonant sounds, but also the same types of sounds. Here in the second word, bagatellen, there are two kinds of consonant sounds: the "p," as in spelling, and the "a," which is a consonant sound.

Even though the two words are spelled out distinctly, having the same kinds of consonant sounds can create a similar effect of the same consonant sound, hence, it's considered a consonance feature. So, in this case, you can find consonance between "taswoning" and "bagatellen".</s>
schreeuwerigere, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Justification:

Consonance in poetry is an effect achieved by repetition of consonant sounds in words. The two words 'schreeuwerigere' and 'vuilpersleiding' both end in the same short vowel sound (-ee) but they do not share any consonant sounds. In other words, the vowel sounds are similar but the consonant sounds are different, making it impossible to create consonance.

So, the answer is No, these two Dutch words do not present an example of consonance based on their consonant sounds.</s>
jut, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-vadervreugde" show consonance, because the first word begins with two consecutive "j" sounds, and the second word also begins with a "j" followed by an "v" sound. While it may not be as pronounced as in languages like Spanish or Italian, the similarity in the onset of both words contributes to the overall feeling of consonance in this instance.</s>
tensie, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "tensie" and "omsingel," show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in words close together. In the given Dutch words "tensie" and "omsingel," the repetition of the consonant 's' in both words creates a sense of rhythm and musicality. 

In the first word "tensie," the 's' sound is repeated twice, while in the second word "omsingel," the 'o' sound is repeated at the end. This creates a pattern of 'ss-ss' and 'oo' sounds, respectively, which contributes to the words' overall sound and structure. 

While it's true that the context in which these words are used is important (e.g., literary or musical), nonetheless, the word structure and syllable patterns do exhibit consonance, as per the definition of this linguistic concept.</s>
koelkamer, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koelkamer" and "voorlig" show a form of consonance, known as geminates (doubling of consonants). The Dutch words "koelkamer" (meaning "cool room") and "voorlig" (meaning "close to") both include the doubled consonant 'r,' which is a common feature of spoken Dutch. The repeated consonant creates a repetitive sound pattern, and both words sound similar when spoken, emphasizing the consonance present in these Dutch words.</s>
ronddient, rendant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the given words "ronddient" and "rendant," the words share a similar sound pattern at their beginning and end. The shared consonance between these words creates a poetic effect, similar to when the same consonant sound occurs multiple times in a sentence or line of poetry.</s>
joysticks, deeltijdbanen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Joysticks-deeltijdbanen:
- "joysticks" has the following consonants: "jtck"
- "deeltijdbanen" has the following consonants: "dttbd"

When we put them together [jt-ck-dtt-ttbd], the consonants cluster together, creating a rhythmic effect that can be considered as consonance.</s>
Jut, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "Jut-detacheer" (with a space between the words) do not show consonance. 

Consonance is the pattern of letter combinations (consonants) in a series of words. In this case, the words do not have any recurring consonants together. The words "Jut" and "detacheer" have no common consonant combination, so they do not share any consonance. Consequently, they do not exhibit consonant pattern among themselves.</s>
veranderingsmogelijkheden, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words show consonance.</s>
attentie, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie-zenuwpijn" show consonance as they both start with the letter "a". In both words, the consonants (t-n, p-t) are repeated or near each other. This repetition can create a pleasing and coherent rhyme that can enhance the meaning and flow of the sentence.</s>
skie, sic, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "skie-sic" show consonance.

In this case, the vowel sequences in both words "skiësic" ("skie-sic" in the phonetic representation) do not appear to be congruent as the Dutch language does not have the same consonant sounds, but they do share common initial consonant sounds. The "-sic" is borrowed from Latin and consists of the Latin word "siccus," which means "dry" or "dusty." When pronounced in Latin or Dutch, the sounds resemble the English words "sky" and "sick." This similarity causes consonance in the sense that the initial sounds of both words sound similar, even though the Dutch script doesn't produce the same consonants for the "-sic-" pattern in the word.</s>
jut, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Justification:
The words 'jut-dienstroosters' both consist of seven characters and share the common consonant sounds 'j', 'd', and 'r'. This consonant 'rhyme', a type of consonance, can be considered as a similarity in sounds between the two words. The term 'jut-dienstroosters' could mean 'chicken work order records'.

Additionally, the structure of the words themselves also contributes to the consonance. Both words start with 'j', continue with 'd', 'r', a vowel (in the second word 'er'), and then end with the same consonant ('s'). This consonance can also be considered as a part of the harmony of the words in a larger text.</s>
indeuk, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance present in the Dutch word pair "indeuk" and "navel." Both words share the same consonant sequence 'n-d-u-k' and '-v-a-l' which contributes to consonance in language. Congruently, this effect can be considered as a linguistic technique used in poetry to create rhymes or similarities in words and sounds.</s>
staken, stak, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance in these Dutch words:

staken-stak: In this homophone pair, the syllable 'st' is used twice, with 'aken' and 'ak'. There is a certain similarity in the sound between the two instances of the letter "t" and "k." This creates a pleasant musicality in the phrase.</s>
kielvlak, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak-ritmeren" do show consonance.

The word "kielvlak" (glade on the hull) consists of the following syllable division: keil-vlak, where "keil" means "cut" and "vlak" refers to a "flat" surface. The ending -vlak has vowel-based consonance, which is the repetition of similar sounds at the end of words.

The second word, "ritmeren" (to arrange rhythmically), comprises the syllables: rit-meren, which has consonant-based consonance. The ending "-meren" repeats the pattern of m followed by r, making the syllables of this word also consonant-based.</s>
veranderingsmogelijkheden, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance between these Dutch words; specifically, the "n" and "s" sounds in the words are similar, creating consonance.</s>
zenuwpijn, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "verlegd" show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device used to draw attention to the repeated consonant sounds in words. In these two words, "zenuwpijn" and "verlegd," the C and L sounds are repeated. This creates a musical quality, making the sentence more appealing to listen to and aids in the flow of the language. Consonance can be used to create a sense of rhythm or emphasize specific ideas in a sentence.</s>
koelkamer, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance. 

In the given words "koelkamer" and "taswoning", the consonance does not exist due to the different sounds and structures of the words. 

"Koelkamer" is a Dutch noun meaning "cool room". Here, the consonance is minimal as the -k-, -r-, and -m- sounds are present in some form, but phonetically, they do not harmonize or show any special pattern of sound. 

On the other hand, "taswoning" is a compound word combining the words "tas" (meaning "suitcase") and "woning" (meaning "home"). Here, the -t-, -s-, and -n- sounds are present but they also do not show any special pattern of sound or harmony. 

Therefore, the given words fail to show any consonance or specific sound pattern that could be used to describe such a pattern.</s>
Jut, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || To determine whether the two Dutch words "Jut-vadervreugde" have consonance, we need to examine their individual meanings and any patterns in their letters.

Word 1: Jut-
Meaning: To be on the brink, to be close to crossing a threshold or limit.

Word 2: Vadervreugde
Meaning: Father's joy, father's happiness.

While the word Vadervreugde does not have obvious consonant patterns in English, it does contain repeated vowels "v" and "d," creating a similar pattern to "Jut-" – another word with the same ending. Thus, the word combination "Jut-vadervreugde" does show an instance of consonance between the two Dutch words, as they share the suffix '-vader-' and vowel patterns.</s>
naievere, aanvuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "naievere-aanvuur" contain consonance. 

This is because, despite both words not having a direct semantic relationship, their vowel-consonant patterns mirror each other. "Naievere" begins with a nasal vowel ("a"), and "aanvuur" begins with a voiced consonant ("aan" as in "aantoonbaar" followed by a voiceless consonant "v").

Thus there is a "v" + nasal ("v" + "e") + nasal ("e") in "Naievere" and a voiceless consonant + vowel + voiced consonant ("v" + "uur" which itself has "u" + nasal "u") which corresponds to "aan" + nasal + voiced consonant in "aanvuur".

Giving them a mirrored structure which is a hallmark of consonance.</s>
slijten, sleedt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "slijten" and "sleedt" show consonance between the letters 'l', 't', and 'd'. These words are pronounced with the sound 'sleedt' and are related to the action of wearing down or sliding.</s>
kasteel, koestijl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'kasteel' and 'koestijl' show consonance.

Consonance is a literary device that occurs when two or more words with significant consonant sounds are used close together. In this instance, 'kasteel' and 'koestijl' both share the 'k' consonant sound. This consonant similarity between the two words creates a musical effect, especially in a longer phrase or passage.</s>
zondagssluiting, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. The given Dutch words show consonance. Both words, "zondagssluiting" (weekend closure) and "schreeuweriger" (loud/loudest), end with the same consonant "r". This contributes to both being more pleasing and connected in sound, which is a part of consonance.</s>
balata, beoliet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "balata" and "beooliet" demonstrate consonance, as they both contain pairs of consonant clusters or digraphs similar to "bal-a-tá" and "be-o-liet." Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when syllables in the same line or phrase all share the same consonant sound.</s>
liefdesgevoelens, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words show consonance.

"Liefdesgevoelens" and "ontruimt" both have a consonant-rhyme scheme, where the consonant sounds in the last syllables of the words match (LIEF-ves and ON-truimt).</s>
attentie, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. The word "attentie" (attention) is followed by a diphthong "e-" rather than a consonant, while "duif" (pigeon) is a single word with a consonant sound "v" at the end. The two words don't share the same consonant pattern or a pattern at all.</s>
Jut, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. In the word "Jut-quintolen," the "ut" sound is repeated in the consecutive consonants "qu" and "t", which creates a sense of consonance and helps in pronunciation and emphasis. This is a common technique in Dutch language and creates a pleasing effect on the ears.</s>
majolica, moeilijk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance. They both have a 'j' or 'l' sound and consonant clusters 'kl' that occur together in each word. This creates a repeating pattern of consonants and helps create a musical or smooth flowing sound in both words.</s>
gekaaide, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is a limited consonance between the Dutch words `gekaaide-tensie` as they both start with the "g" (voiced) sound, followed by a "kaai" (/kɑːi/) sound.

In terms of phonetic similarity but not necessarily true consonance, the words share a similar structure and begin with the same sound, and while they may not sound completely the same when spoken, you can clearly recognize and discern the individual sounds that make up each word. Consonance, at its essence, highlights the presence of common sounds in a piece of literature and is most often used as a literary device to give poetic or musical effect. In this case, the shared "gk" sound does exhibit a sort of consonance between the words. Although the words do not share the exact phonetic form, there is a level of similar sounding sounds present, making it a form of consonance, albeit a limited one.</s>
aanstaar, instuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words show consonance. In both words, you have 'st' being a common consonant at the end of the word, making these words similar in form, which can be considered as consonance. 

In the first word, 'aanstaar' the ending consonant 'st' is a part of a more complex word 'staart', which can mean tail. Hence, the consonant 'st' is repeated due to being a part of the original word, 'aanstaar' translates to follow tail which has the same consonant 'st'. 

In the second word 'instuur' the ending consonant 'st' is also a part of the word 'stuur', translating to control, in this case, the consonant 'st' is formed because of being part of the larger word 'stuur,' both consonant 'st' are related to the same meaning or function.</s>
tippend, uitpent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tippend-uitpent" show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device in language that occurs when the vowel sounds in a series of words are repeated or closely resembled. In this case, both words share the consonant sounds "/p/" in "p" and "/t/" in "t." When we examine the words "tippend" and "uitpent," both have the identical consonant sound in the word "p," which creates consonance between the two words. Despite not sharing identical vowel sounds, the use of the consonant "p" establishes a consonantal connection between the two Dutch words, thus qualifying them as exhibiting consonance.</s>
plantluis, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis-gemeste" show consonance.

In the provided words, there is an example of consonance where the three vowels ('la' in "plantluis" and 'se' in "gemeste") are followed by the same consonant sound ('m' in both words). This sound-spelling relationship can be considered as 'consonance.'

Consonance in poetry and language typically involves consecutive vowel sounds in a word that are repeated in a stressed syllable. By identifying the exact sound patterns in the provided words, it becomes evident that there is a similarity in sound that contributes to the concept of consonance.</s>
click, kelk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "click-kelk" show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds at the end of words or within words. In "click-kelk," the 'k' sound is repeated, creating a repetitive pattern that contributes to the consonance of the phrase.</s>
hartzwakte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "hartzwakte-nadook" show consonance, but it may not be as strong as some other words in the language that emphasize particular consonant sounds.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within the same or adjacent syllables. The connection between "hartzwakte" and "nadook" is through the repeated "tz" consonant, although it's not as strong as when you find multiple consonants in a row in a different word. But such instances of consonance can be considered creative language devices in Dutch.</s>
ontroomt, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of the same consonant sound at the end of two or more stressed syllables in a row. In this case, "ontroom" and "aanvijl" do not have consonant sounds in this pattern. Therefore, they do not show consonance.</s>
narratiefste, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words have similar characteristics in their consonants and their formation, making them sound similar and creating musicality. The first word, "narratiefste" means "most narrative" and the second word "invul" means "filling in". The similarities in their consonant structure (e.g. "n", "t", and "f" in "narratiefste", and "s", "l", and "ng" in "invul") make them exhibit consonance within the language.</s>
piepjongst, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst-toereikend" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of a consonant sound within a phrase or sentence, and in the given Dutch words, there is a repeated "p" sound in "piep" and "jongst." This repetition creates a rhythmic pattern and makes the words easier to remember, sound pleasing when spoken, and contributes to their overall harmony.</s>
avond, vanuit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "avond" and "vanuit" have consonance.

Justification:
- The word "avond" (meaning evening) starts with soft consonants ("a" and "v"), which rhyme with the "v" in "vanuit" (meaning from, out, or away from).
- The word "vanuit" ends with consonants (the "t" in "uit"), which also rhyme with the "v" in "avond."

Thus, in the context of these two words, you can hear the similar consonant sounds of "v" and "t."</s>
tembaarste, uiteenbarst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance because they both contain the same consonant sequence 'tm', which creates a rhyming pattern and contributes to the overall sound and feel of the words. Here's a breakdown of the consonant sequences in each word:

tembaarste - tmbaairst
uiteenbarst - tmbtnaast</s>
witten, wat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Consonance is the repetition of a consonant sound at the end of words or syllables, typically in a line of poetry or a verse. In the Dutch words "witten-wat," you can see that both words end with the same consonant sound "t" and "t" respectively. This repetition of consonant sounds gives a poetic or musical effect, making the words more pleasing to the ear.</s>
bedrijving, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

The reason I arrived at this conclusion is that although both words end with the same sound ("t"), the root word structures are different (bedrijving and ontroom). The consonance in Dutch words refers to the use of similar consonant sounds at the end of words. However, in this case, the consonant sounds at the end of the words do not correspond to or relate to each other, and therefore, they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
esters, oestrus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "esters-oestrus" show consonance.

To break down what consonance is in the context of poetry or linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of specific sounds within a fixed distance of each other, usually in the same line of verse. In this case, "esters" and "oestrus" both have the "s" consonant in the same syllable - "s-s" - making these words have consonance.</s>
detacheer, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'detacheer' and 'vuilpersleiding' show consonance. Both words end in the same sounding consonant: /t/ in "detacheer" and /l/ in "vuilpersleiding". This consonance gives a structured, consistent look at the end of both words, hence an overall visual pattern.</s>
etnisch, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || The Dutch words "etnisch" and "uitrokend" do not demonstrate consonance, as they do not share the same consonant sounds. The first word, "etnisch," contains "tn" sound, while the second word, "uitrokend," features the "rt" sound. Consonance requires that consonants are repeated within the same syllable. Therefore, the answer is No.</s>
zenuwpijn, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the use of similar consonant sounds in a sequence or a series within the same language sentence or phrase. In the given example, "zenuwpijn" (tension pain) and "trompetboom" (trumpet tree) have no similar consonant sounds within the words themselves.

However, without seeing other Dutch words, it is difficult to determine whether the sentence as a whole exhibits consonance based on these two individual words. It may be helpful to look at their translations into other languages to get a clearer sense of consonance.</s>
gekaaide, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "gekaaide-ontduik" show consonance, as they both start with the "k" sound, followed by the same vowel combination ("aai" in "gekaaide" and "-td" in "ontduik"). Consonance, in literature, poetics, and linguistics, refers to the repetition of consonant sounds, with or without a vowel sound, within words or syllables. The repetition of consonants in these words creates a musical and visually pleasing effect.</s>
onlust, inlijstte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words show consonance.</s>
noveer, naievere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "noveer" and "naievere" show consonance. Both words end with the consonant sequence "vr," which is the last three letters in each word. This creates an appealing harmony or similarity between the two words, making them sound similar.</s>
bijten, bat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bijten" (to bite) and "bat" (bat) show consonance. In literature, consonance refers to the recurrence of consonant sounds at the end of words or by themselves within a phrase or sentence. In this case, both words share the "t" sound in their final consonant, which contributes to the consonance in the phrase 'bijten-bat', where 'bijten' means 'to bite' and 'bat' means 'bat'.</s>
kielvlakken, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlakken" and "voorlieg" show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device in which consecutive or nearby consonant sounds are emphasized, creating a pattern or rhythm. In this case, both words include "k" and "l", which are consonant sounds, and they are both final consonants in each word (l in "kielvlakken" and g in "voorlieg"). This creates an intermittent emphasis on those consonants, providing a clear rhythm that signifies consonance. So, the two words have a matching consonant pattern that contributes to the overall rhythm or flow of the sentence.</s>
plantluis, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the given Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when there is a repetition of similar consonant sounds in words, either at the end of a line or between different words. 

In the given phrase "plantluis-onneembaarder", the consonant sounds "pl" occur once at the beginning of the word and "r" is also present at the end; however, there is no proper consonance as it lacks the regular pattern of repetition of consonant sounds.</s>
voord, vreet, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Voor-vreet is an anacoluthon rather than showing consonance.</s>
Jut, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "Jut-esthetica" do not show consonance. Consonance refers to two or more words that share consonant sounds. In this case, "Jut-esthetica" features a single vowel sound 'u' at the beginning and end of the two words, but there are no consonant sounds shared between them.</s>
meridionaal, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words do show consonance, as they end with the same consonant sound: /a/ (pronounced as in father) in 'meridionaal' and /a/ (pronounced as in father) in 'negerwijk'. This repetition creates a musical effect or consonance, which can add to the visual or auditory appeal of the phrase.</s>
uitreikend, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "uitreikend" and "nadook," do show consonance because they both end with the "nd" sound, which is pronounced similarly. Consonance occurs when two or more words in a phrase or sentence have the same consonant sounds, typically at the end of the words. This literary device helps create a rhythm and flow in writing, making it an attractive aspect of language. In this case, having two words with the same ending consonant sound contributes to an overall feeling of harmony and rhythm in the sentences or phrases where they appear.</s>
apparaat, puurt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In this case, we can observe two words that display this poetic device: "apparaat" and "puurt." "Apparaat" consists of three identical letters, namely "p," "p," and "a," which create a smooth flow in the word's structure. Similarly, "puurt" also has two consecutive consonants ("p" and "u" in the second word) which contributes to the overall consonance in the set of words.</s>
ziftten, zeeft, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "ziftten" and "zeef" are pronounced similarly and consist of two consonants each, which qualifies them for the category of consonance in Dutch grammar. This feature of sound patterning is known as homorganic palatalization. 

"Ziftten" is derived from an obsolete verb "zijften," which means "blow" (now "zichten"). "Zeef" is derived from the Old Low Franconian noun "zeef," which means "sheet." Both words end with the consonants "tt" or "ff" where the pronunciation and spelling are phonetically similar (similarity in sound not spelling). The similarity of pronunciation increases the likelihood of being considered a case of consonance. Therefore, these words exhibit consonance, making the answer to the question "Yes."</s>
reinetten, randt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "reiënetten" and "randt" show consonance in the Dutch language due to the use of similar consonants and the repetition of the letter "t".

In both words, the letter "t" is repeated, and the consonant sounds (initial 'r' in "reiënetten" and final 'n' in "randt") are similar. This creates a pattern or similarity of consonant sounds, giving the words a similar feel or rhythm, which is a characteristic of consonance.</s>
duivelsklauwen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Explanation: Consonance refers to the recurring of similar consonants at the ends of words or syllables within a phrase or line of poetry. In your example, "duivelsklauwen" and "aanvijl" do not share the same ending consonant or vowel, so they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
jatte, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. This principle of consonance or correlation between consonant sounds in succession is known as "consonantal consonance" or "consonantal parallelism". It is a literary device used by poets, particularly in the Romantic movement, to achieve smooth and flowing effects. In the given Dutch words, the repetition of consonants (e.g. 'j', 'a', 't', 'e', 's', 't', 'h', 'e', 't') creates a musical quality in the words which might resonate with the reader's ear.</s>
extra's, case-story's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

The words "extra's-case-story's" may seem to possess a phonetic oddity, but this linguistic feature is intentional and not a linguistic rule violation, known as a "hack" in Dutch. In these words, the consonant cluster "tr" is repeated, as well as the sequence "ss", which is common in Dutch to represent the sound /s/. The word "extra" has the vowels short "a", long "e", "r", "t" and has "s" and "s" at the end, while "case" and "story" have consonants similar to the first part, but in different order and without repetition, making the repetition of the consonants "tr" and "s" more noticeable. It is not unusual for words in Dutch to have multiple occurrences of the same letter or sequence of letters, forming "hacks" and rhymes that add to the language's expressiveness and beauty.</s>
piepjongst, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the Dutch words "piepjongst-verlichtten," the words "piepjongst" and "verlichtten" share the final consonant, which is "t." This consonant appears in the middle and the end of both words, creating consonance.</s>
oprook, park, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because the consonants in both words are similar and create a pattern when spoken. The word ‘oprook’ has consonants "p-r-k" whereas "park" also has those exact same consonants. That pattern creates consonance in both words allowing them to sound similar.</s>
gemeste, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. The Dutch words "gemeste-voorlegt" show consonance. 

Justification: Both words have similar consonant patterns that can be perceived as sounding alike, which contributes to a certain degree of consonance. The "-mest-" and "-legt-" suffixes of the first and second words, respectively, also play a role in creating a consonant effect.</s>
kenau, koen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kenau-koen" show consonance. In this case, consonance is characterized by the presence of repeated consonant sounds at the end of two or more words. In this pair of words, both end in the same consonant sounds, "n", resulting in a sense of connectedness and unity of sound.</s>
Papoes, pipse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Papoes" and "pipse" show consonance. The consonant "p" is repeated twice in both words, which contributes to a similar sound pattern and might give them an overall similar feel or mood, due to this recurring consonant sound.</s>
etnisch, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-uitreikend" show consonance because of the repetition of the "ch" and "ck" sounds within the word. This is an example of a common linguistic technique that poets often use to create pleasing and memorable melodies, often called alliteration.</s>
jut, beschietend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
saters, oestrus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "saters" and "oestrus" exhibit consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within words. In this case, both words end in the same consonant sound "-s" (Sater's, Sate's) and share the same consonant sound in the middle of the word ("es-" in 'sators and 'oestrus").</s>
neukten, nekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within words, typically consonants at the end of words. In this case, the words "neukten" and "nekt" don't show any consonant sounds that repeat.</s>
schijt, scheten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schijt" and "scheten" show consonance.

Consonance is a poetic device where words or sounds that share the same consonant at the end of words or syllables are used to create a rhythmical effect. In the words "schijt" and "scheten," the "-sch-" consonant sound appears in both words, making them part of the same rhythmic pattern. This technique contributes to the overall musicality of the sentence and enhances the reader's experience of experiencing the poem and its textual features.</s>
duivelsklauw, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "duivelsklauw" (devil's claw) and "taswoning" (tassel winding) exhibit consonance. 

In both words, the endings ("-klauw" and "-woning") alliterate or rhyme, creating a pleasing effect in the Dutch language. The short vowel sounds "a" and "u" are further emphasized by the consonant sounds "k" and "w," providing an additional sense of musicality to the words.</s>
offset, feestten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the words contain consonants that are similar in sound, making them show some degree of consonance. "Offset" is a word that means "to move something to one side of neutral, and "feestten" means to celebrate or throw a party. The 'set' sound is found in both nouns and the '-t' sound is shared between the words. 

While slight consonance may not be a significant factor in Dutch words especially given the language's vibrant and distinctive vocabulary, consonance (or sonority) is a significant feature in Dutch phonology. The '-set' and '-t' sounds (pronounced as /s/ and /t/) are especially common in Dutch, and they often appear in compound words as well.

This is how we can perceive the phonetic similarity of the given Dutch words, "offset-feestten" or "offsett-festt". However, as you can see the compound words are not common, and may have specific context in which they may be used.</s>
naduiken, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "naduiken" and "esthetica" do show consonance. They share the consonants "ds", which gives them similar sonority and makes them easier to remember.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both the Dutch words "loopgravenstellingen" and "ontduik" share similar consonant combinations, which contributes to the overall sound similarity between the words. This phenomenon is known as consonance.

Specifically, there is a palindromic element in both words as well: "loop" in "loopgravenstellingen" and "ont" in "ontduik". 

Consonance contributes to the overall style and mood of the text it occurs in, as well as to our emotional responses to that text.</s>
asten, st, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These words, "asten-st," do not show consonance because they do not have any corresponding consonants or letter combinations that match in both words, unlike consonance, which refers to a similarity or parallelism in the sounds of words.</s>
nadook, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance in their structures, as both contain the consonants "n," "d," "k," "v," "l," and "g." Consonance is a literary device where two or more words have similar consonant sounds, creating a sense of rhythm and unity within the text. These words can be read aloud, and the repetition of the consonant sounds can be pleasing to the ear, emphasizing the connection between the words and enhancing their meaning.</s>
aflieten, flute, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance between the Dutch words "aflieten" and "flute." Both words share the consecutive consonants "f-l-i-e-t-e-n" which form perfect consonantal rhyme. In English, the words would be "put out" and "flute." This linguistic pattern gives the sentence a more rhythmic flow and emphasis on the repeated consonant sounds.</s>
hartzwakte, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words show consonance.

In the first word, "hartzwakte" (heart failure), there's an 'z' sound which creates a similar consonant pattern to the second word, "vuilpersleiding" (sewer pipe), which contains 'v' and 'l' sounds. This creates a sense of unity and rhyme between the two words, creating consonance.</s>
omsingel, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words, "omsingel-nadook," do contain consonant sounds that are similar or repeated. Omsingel in Dutch means to circle or encircle something, and nadook implies an angle or turning point. Thus, the word has a clear consonant pattern and repetition that contributes to its sound.</s>
verluchtten, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance because they both contain the letter "l." The first word, "verluchtten," contains three syllables: verb+luch+ten. The second word, "statica," also contains three syllables, with "sta" being the first two characters. Both words end in the same sound ("tna" for "luchten" and "tza" for "statica").</s>
ezelen, zuil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ezelen-zuil" show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device that occurs when a series of consonant sounds occur close to each other without vowel sounds in between. In "ezelen-zuil," the consonants "z" and "l" are repeated in a short sequence, creating a consonantal rhyme. Therefore, the words exhibit consonance.</s>
autosport, uitspruiten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || These words show consonance in the same way that two words in English might share some letters: they have the letters "u" and "s" at the end. However, in this case, they are not consonant words that harmonize in terms of sound. A true consonant word, in consonance, is a word where every letter in it is a consonant, like "dibs", where every letter is a consonant. The same goes for "bass", in which all letters are also consonants. So, in "auto" and "sport", only one consonant is present. Therefore, autosport-uitspruiten do not exhibit consonance.</s>
hoed, heet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "hoed-heet" show consonance (also known as consonance clusters). 

Consonance occurs when there are consonant sounds at the end of words in adjacent or nearby syllables, usually with a particular focus on words related by theme or topic. In this case, the ending consonant of "hoed" is "t," and it appears again in "heet" with the same syllable structure. This repetition of consonant sounds creates a pleasing, onomatopoeic effect, which is a characteristic of consonance.</s>
modi, midden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "modi-midden" show consonance.

Justification:
Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within a phrase. In "modi-midden," the final consonant of each word (i in "modi" and "midden") is repeated. This technique is called alliteration, and it often emphasizes certain words and creates a musical effect. Here, it is a subtle aspect of the language that can be found in poetic verses and other figurative pieces of language, but is not the primary focus for understanding or interpreting the text.</s>
buren, bourree, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "buren" and "bourree" show consonance. This means that the endings of these words have a similar or matching consonant sound. In the case of the words you provided, both contain the sound "r."</s>
wegdruip, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip-bedienaars" show consonance, as they both feature the "-drip-bedien-" pattern (with "drip" being a repeated element). Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds, often in close proximity within words or lines of poetry.</s>
wegdruip, avondfeesten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Justification: In both words, there are three consecutive letters that share the same consonant sound. "Wegdruip" has the consonant "D" at the start (both letters are pronounced similar), "Avondfeesten" has the consonant "F" at the end (the words "a" and "van" are pronounced similarly). Therefore, they show consonance in Dutch sentence.</s>
indeuk, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "indeuk-vuilpersleiding" shows consonance. 

Justification: The string of letters "indeuk-vuilpersleiding" has both "ei" and "nd" as vowel-consonant combinations. Consonance occurs when the sequence of consonants is repeated, especially in the end, as in "indeuk-vuilpersleiding". This repeated pattern in the word gives it a rhythmic appeal and helps the user retain the information or phrase much better. The consonance makes the word easier to remember because it has the same sounds at the end which are important for phonetic memory as well, like in English- "cat" and "hat" or "pot"-both sound similar and are very easy to remember. This also contributes to how the word flows when spoken which is a poetic aesthetic value.</s>
kwats, equatie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kwats-equatie" show consonance. 

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds (such as the "t" or "s" sound in this case) at the end of words or between words, which helps to create a sense of musicality or onomatopoeia within the sentence or text.

In the case of "kwats-equatie," the end of the second word, "equatie," sounds similar to the second syllable of the first word "kwats," creating a smooth and connected phrase. This use of consonance helps to give the words a harmonious quality, which can enhance the overall sound and meaning of the message.</s>
ontroomt, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance as they both contain the "tt" and "nn" sounds at the end, which are part of the consonant cluster.</s>
piekt, pikte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "piekt-pikte", the -ik- sound in both words is identical and the consonant clusters in each word also have a similar structure:

- In "piekt", the -ik- sound is followed by a "t" sound (pie-kt).
- In "pikte", the -ik- sound is followed by a "k" sound (pik-te).

Both words feature an identical or similar structure of consonant clusters, resulting in consonance.</s>
generaalsepauletten, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "generaalsepauletten-indeuk" show consonance. The word consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at a certain distance apart, typically near the end of words. In this case, the consonant sounds "g" and "n" are repeated at both the ends of the word, forming two instances of consonance.</s>
fonds, fijntes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "fonds-fijntes" show consonance.

Consonance is an aspect of rhetoric and literature in which repetition of consonant sounds creates a certain effect. In this case, the "-nds" and "-fjn" sounds in the word "fonds-fijntes" create consonant repetition, making the words sound more harmonious to the listener.</s>
welbedachte, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
plantluis, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "trompetboom" show consonance. 

- In both words, the first and last consonant (l and m) have different values.
- The second and third consonants in "plantluis" (planteluis) and "trompetboom" (trompetbuom) are different.

Even though the first and last consonants in each word have different values, the word construction between the two words still contributes to the consonance they share. Therefore, the words "plantluis" and "trompetboom" can be considered as instances of consonance in Dutch grammar.</s>
wegdruip, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "registratierechten" do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when consecutive syllables have the same consonant sound in words that are part of a line of poetry or text. The words "wegdruip" and "registratierechten" do not carry the same consonant sound in consecutive syllables.</s>
ontruimt, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || The Dutch words "ontruimt" and "indeuk" do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in words that are near each other in a line of poetry. In these words, no clear consonant sounds for a consonance pattern are found. Therefore, these words do not exhibit consonance.</s>
ingestorte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words "ingestorte-nadook" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or syllables. In this case, both words have the consonants "st" and "n" at the end. This creates a rhythmic and musical effect to the two words, which is an example of consonance.</s>
detacheer, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "voorlegt" do exhibit consonance.

In Dutch language, consonance is not as strict and overt as in Spanish or French, for example, where consonant clusters are often repeated. However, in Dutch, vowel and consonant repetition can create a rhythmic and poetic effect. Both "detacheer" and "voorlegt" have two consecutive consonants in the middle of the word which can create a rhythmic pattern that evokes a sense of rhyme. Therefore, these Dutch words exhibit consonance, though not in the same overt language convention as in English and other languages.

In this case, "detacheer" may be more clearly linked with "consonant cluster", as it has two consonant clusters (a double "t" and "gh" or "ch") where vowel or consonant repetition is not as evident. In the word "voorlegt", the overt repetition of "l" can be perceived as a kind of consonance.</s>
geest, oogstten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
malie, mollen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the dutch words "malie-mollen" show consonance. 

In this case, you've got "m" in "malie" and "m" in "mollen". That's a pretty obvious example, and there's no need for complicated phonetic sounds. But consonance isn't always as apparent - you have "k" in "calico" and "c" in 'cat', but that's one simple example that wouldn't typically classify as consonance. 

In terms of this word pairing, the "consonance" can be found on purpose. It's a way to make the words easier to remember due to their repetition of the sound of a specific letter. The repetition "m" helps those words sound similar and this makes it easier to quickly identify them as distinct, individual words. This is a classic example of wordplay, a specific way that language is used to create memorable, interesting words.</s>
handicaprace, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Step 1: Identify the Dutch words
The given Dutch words are "handicaprace-lawinegevaar".

Step 2: Analyze the Dutch words
The words are: handicap (handicapped), race (running competition), lawine (avalanche), and gevaar (danger).

Step 3: Check for consonance
Consonance refers to the repeating sound or a pattern of similar sounds in words. In Dutch, the most common patterns used for consonant sounds are l, r, and -e. To determine if these words have consonance, we'll examine each word for a pattern.

handicap (hand – icap): pattern is l (not a complete pattern, as there is no real pattern of similar sounds)
race (rac-ing): pattern is r
lawinegevaar (law – in – gewa-aar): pattern is -a, but all vowels are different.

Step 4: Conclusion
Upon analyzing the Dutch words, none of them show a clear pattern of similar consonant sounds, making consonance not present in any of the words.

Answer: No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.</s>
uitrokend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Analyze:

 - 'uitrokend' uses the sequence 'tr', 'k' and 'nd'. 
 - 'indeuk' consists of the pattern 'de', 'u', 'k'. 

There's no recurrence of consonant sound between these two words.</s>
zondagssluiting, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Explanation:
"Zondagssluiting-ontroomt" (Sunday closing-release) shows a strong consonant pattern in both words. "Zondagssluiting" (Sunday closing) and "ontroomt" (release) both end with the same consonant clusters ("Zz" and "Ot"). This creates a pleasing effect for a reader.</s>
radende, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words demonstrate consonance as they both share the suffix '-den' (/dən/) and the root 'raden' (/rɑːˈdn/, 'to advise'), although with different vowels in each word (i.e. 'e' in 'radende' and 'ul' in 'invul'). Consonance, or consonantal alliteration, refers to the repetition of the same consonant sound at the beginning of words or sounds. Both words begin with a similar consonant sound, and while there isn't exact pronounced repetition ('en'-'iv'), their phonetic similarity is sufficient to fall under the definition of consonance.</s>
treknet, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'treknet-ordende' do show consonance.

The word 'treknet' is made up of four syllables 'trek-net', and the last letter 't' from the first syllable 'trek' is repeated in the second syllable 'net'. The first and third consonants 't' and 'd' from 'treknet' are then repeated as 'T' sound in the second and third letters of 'ordende'.</s>
duif, extraherend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance as they both end with the consonant combination -her- (pronounced 'er' as in herring).</s>
waan, won, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance in the Dutch words "waan-won." The pattern of vowels and consonants forming similar sounds (phonetic features) in the word is consonance. "Waan" is spelled with 'W' and 'N' sounds, similar to "won." The pronunciation and spelling of "waan-won" create a recognizable pattern, which can contribute to the rhythm or sound of the words.</s>
treknet, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Treknet-naduiken both contain the '-n-' and '-u-' consonants at the same position in the words, creating a similar sound pattern and contributing to consonance in the phrase.</s>
regimentscommandant, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

"Regimentscommandant" and "Navel" both have a sonorant vowel sound (e in English) in the middle, creating consonance or a kind of rhyming effect in this example.</s>
brommers, bramraas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show some consonance. Let me explain:

Consonance is a literary device where the use of the same consonant sound in a sequence is repeated. While brommers and bramraas are individual words, each ending with the consonant sound "a", they have different meanings. Despite their meanings, they are still eligible for consonance because the shared "a" sound is continuous throughout both words.

So, you see some level of consonance here. However, without knowing the full context of the sentences or phrases that these words belong to, it's impossible to know the degree of consonance between them.</s>
vloekt, vlakten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
wegdruip, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Wegdruip in both words has similar shapes, "wp" in the first word and "tsp" in the second word. In Dutch, consonance refers to when consonant sounds are used in the same position, or when repeated consonants are used within the same set of words. Here, both words contain the consonant "w" in the same position, and in the second word, "p" and "t" are repeated.</s>
plantluis, kelderdeur, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "kelderdeur" show consonance.

In both words, the long vowel "a" ( /ˈpɔʏntˈlyːs/) is followed by a single consonant "p" or "k", creating a pattern of consonant sounds: "plant-p", "luis-k", "kelde-d", "uur-u". The consonance occurs due to the consecutive occurrence of different consonants following the same vowel.</s>
etnisch, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-indeuk" show consonance.

The presence of several consonant clusters, such as "tn", "sh", and "ck", creates a pattern of similar consonant sounds throughout the word, thus creating consonance.</s>
slijten, salet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance because both words contain the same consonants (-tt-).</s>
voorlichtte, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlichtte" and "aanvijl" show consonance.

Both words consist of a word-final /t/ sound followed by a long vowel (/iː/) sound and a word-initial schwa (/ə/) sound. This kind of pattern is known as consonant gradation or consonance, where words that share a specific consonant combination at the end of the word often sound alike.</s>
vuurzee, vrezen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words show consonance.

Here's a breakdown of the words and their consonant features: 

1. "vuur" (fire) is a commonly used Dutch word with only two consonants, 'uur' is also a commonly used Dutch word with two consonants. Both of these words feature a voiceless fricative consonant, the sound /v//.

2. "zee" (sea) is a two syllable Dutch word, with the consonant 'z' in the first syllable.

3. "vrezen" (fears) is another example of a two syllable Dutch word that shows consonance. Here, the 'r' in 'vrezen' forms the voiceless alveolar fricative /vr// sound, which is a common consonant in Dutch.

Consonance is a poetic technique that highlights patterns in language and emphasizes certain sounds. In the words "vuurzee-vrezen," the repetition of consecutive consonants highlights these common consonants and creates a rhythmic pattern that draws the listener's attention to the similarities between the words. In this context, vuurzee-vrezen showcases the Dutch language's unique characteristics and highlights its richness by emphasizing its consonance patterns in this particular combination of words.</s>
zondagssluiting, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance in the form of clusters or sequences of consonant sounds, which enhances the overall effect of the words. The first word, "zondagssluiting," contains a cluster of two consonant sounds, "sS," and a final consonant "t." The second word, "pruimenboomgaarden," contains two such clusters of consonant sounds, "pP" and "mM," both of which are followed by consonants. The presence of these consonant clusters gives the words a rhythmic quality, contributing to the consonance effect.</s>
voorlig, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig" and "ontduik" do show consonance. The reason for this is that "voer" and "ontduik" both possess the same ending -'ik', and this is a recognizable pattern in Dutch language. Let's briefly analyze the words:

1. "Voorlig" (meaning "sitting in front" or "standing in front") has the base word "voer", which has been replaced with the suffix "-lig" creating a noun meaning "sitting" and is formed by adding -'lig' after the base word (-er). In this case, 'lag' is added to the base 'voer' creating 'vuurlag'.

2. "Ontduik" (meaning "disappear" or "vanish") is formed by adding the suffix "-duik" after the base word 'ont'. The base word 'ont' has the same meaning as in 'ontdek', hence 'ont-duik'.

So, the consonance in these Dutch words is due to the presence of the suffix -'ik'. This pattern is a typical, recognizable form of consonance in the Dutch language. Hence, both words (voorlig and ontduik) show consonance because of the '-ik' ending in both words.</s>
r, eren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "r-eren" do not show consonance. Consonance refers to similar letter combinations, either at the beginning, middle, or end of words, in this case, the repeated 'r' sound is the only similarity between the two words.</s>
etnisch, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-naduiken" show consonance.

The reason for this is the presence of the consonant clusters "ts-" and "kn-," which are both found in the two words. This creates a pleasing pattern and sound in the words. Consonance can enhance the poem's overall flow and rhythm.</s>
quintolen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "quintolen-ontruimt" do not show consonance. 

To elaborate on why it's not consonant, let's break down each word:

1. Quintolen: This word is comprised entirely of nasal vowels (a, e, o) and has no consonants whatsoever.
2. Ontruimt: This word, on the other hand, contains consonants in every syllable: 'on' is unvoiced alveolar plosive, 'tru' is an affricate, and 'imt' makes use of the velar stop. 

Consonance refers to parallelism in a linguistic structure where words or syllables with similar consonants, or combinations of consonants, are used together in the same phrase or unit. In this case, "quintolen" is missing consonants and appears to be lacking any parallelism of consonances.</s>
feilt, afloodt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In both words, the vowels are not in their expected positions, and the consonants are grouped in unusual patterns, resulting in a slightly dissonant pattern. As a result, both words can be considered as having 'feilt-afloodt'-type consonance.</s>
houdt, hoed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance but it's not a specific consonant pattern that stands out in the words "houdt-hoed." Consonance can be a sound or letter pattern that repeats either at the beginning, middle, or end of words or syllables. Thus, even if you don't notice a particular consonant pattern, the repetition of the "h" sound in "houdt-hoed" indicates their connection and similarity, which contributes to consonance. The words "houdt-hoed" create an illusion of a more coherent sentence, so you could say that the words do show consonance.</s>
curator, krotter, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Justification:

Consonance is a literary technique that involves the repeated consonant sounds in a phrase or line of poetry. While both words (curator-krotter) share some letters in common, curator and krotter are not close spellings, nor are they using similar consonant sounds in an apparent rhyme or pattern. Thus, the words do not exhibit consonance in Dutch.</s>
licks, electie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words licks-electie show consonance.

In the given words, you can observe that both words have related sound combinations, namely "kl," "ct," "ck," "ls," and "s." The presence of these similar consonants makes the English translation easier and helps in understanding the context. This is an instance of consonance in Dutch, which reflects the similar language structure and features of Dutch and English languages.</s>
afgrijzenwekkendere, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "afgrijzenwekkendere-esthetica" show consonance in the formation of their syllables. Here, the pattern "af-" and "-esthetica" are repeating and following a similar pattern in syllabic arrangement. This effect is called consonance, it occurs when the consonant sounds in the same syllables of two or more words closely resemble each other. This creates a pleasing rhythmic effect. In this case, the two words sound quite similar in terms of their syllabic structure, contributing to a sense of beauty, and sophistication as they relate to art, and aesthetics. Therefore, this instance exhibits consonance.</s>
toereikend, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. The two words are "toereikend" and "voorlieg" and they do not share any consonants in their sounds. The Dutch language is characterized by its stress patterns and vowel inventory, rather than its consonant sounds. In Dutch, syllable structure determines the types of consonants that can occur together as opposed to frequency of occurrence.</s>
detacheer, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "detacheer" and "bedienaars" do show consonance.

Let's break down the words and explain the consonance more thoroughly:

1. "Detacheer" (to detach, separate) and "bedienaars" (controllers) both share the sound "d" in the roots "detach" and "bedien." This sound is a prominent vowel /d/ that is common in Dutch language.

2. The endings of both words also provide some consonance. The first word ends with "-eer," a common ending for verbs in the past tense (in this case, detach). It is reminiscent of "-en" in the English word "denounced."

The second word, "bedienaars," shares the first syllable "bedien-" with the first word. The second syllable, "-aars," is a similar case of the same vowel /aars/ that often shows up in Dutch words like "leiders" (leaders).

So to answer the question, the Dutch words do display consonance, which is a visual and audible similarity among their sounds.</s>
tussenklanken, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tussenklanken-ontruimt" do show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary technique that involves the repetition of consonant sounds within a line or a stanza. In this case, the repeated consonant sounds include the "n" in "tussenklanken" and the "u" in "ontruimt." While this example is not elaborate or overtly noticeable, it does demonstrate a form of consonance.</s>
gekaaide, piepjongst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekaaide-piepjongst" show consonance.

The reason is that consonance, in Dutch, refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words or within words. In this pair of words, there's a repetition of the 'p' sound at the end of each word. This makes it easier to pronounce and creates a sort of musicality to the words. However, it doesn't necessarily make them particularly poetic or literary in nature, as there are likely countless other words that would also exhibit this property.

It's important to remember that while the pronunciation helps a little bit, "gekaaide-piepjongst" is not a typical Dutch phrase or word, and it contains both a vowel and an -st ending, which is less common in Dutch words. This doesn't make it intrinsically less interesting, but it does mean that it could be challenging to find a real-life Dutch phrase where the same effect is achieved. The most natural way to accomplish this is by having a vowel and a terminal 't': 'blaktjot-blottjot'.</s>
quintolen, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words do show consonance, specifically the pattern of repeating specific consonant sounds. "Quintolen" features the palatalized consonant /x/, making it the first syllable in the second word "Wegdruip." The "weg-" segment and the "-druip" segment both feature the consonant sound /w/, contributing to the consonance effect. The similar consonant patterns help to create an aural effect, making the phrase sound more harmonious and consistent.</s>
Jut, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-radende" show consonance. In this case, it indicates similarity in the combination of consonants between the two words. The word "Jut" begins with the consonant "j," which is similar in the word "Jut-radende." The word "radende," which means "cheerful" or "enjoyable," also starts with a consonant "r." The consonance in this pair of words is due to the presence of the same consonants "j-r" that give both words a similar sound.</s>
bijknipt, beknopt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words have the pattern S, S, V, T, T, where S, S, and T, T are consonants and V is a vowel (ei in this case). The consonance between the two words creates a pleasing sound and cohesive meaning.</s>
detacheer, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a word or between successive words. In this case, there is no consistent consonant sound between the two words: 

- "detacheer" has consonant sounds "t" and "s," whereas "nadook" has no recognized consonant sound within the word itself.</s>
krappere, kropaar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "krappere-kropaar" show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of the same consonant sound within words, often close together in a line of text. "Krappere-kropaar" demonstrates consonance because both words end with the consonant sound "p," which creates a musical rhythm within the sentence, adding a musical quality to the language. This repetition of consonant sounds makes the sentence more pleasing to the ear, enhancing the overall poetic quality.</s>
russen, ras, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "russen-ras" show consonance. The word "russen" (Russian) and "ras" (breed) both begin with the same consonant sound (R) and the final consonant sound (S) is also similar. This creates a rhyme and a musical quality in the phrase.</s>
joysticks, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words show consonance. They both have the same consonant sounds in the middle of the word: "ts" combined with "k" in "joysticks" and "ng" combined with "w" in "Negerwijk". It creates a subtle repetition of consonant sounds, which can be considered as consonance.</s>
tensie, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "ingestorte" show consonance, as they have two similar consonant sounds (t/n and s) in the same word positions. Consonance can also increase the musicality of a phrase, making it more pleasing to the ear.</s>
kreupelbossen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kreupelbossen-esthetica" show consonance.

In this case, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a word or sequence of words. In this example, the words "kreupelbossen" ("mossywoods") and "esthetica" both end in the consonant "k," creating a consonance effect. Although the second half of the words has fewer consonants, the final consonant sound in each word is still the same, thus contributing to the consonance.</s>
funds, fanatische, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words funds-fanatischen do show consonance.

The words "funds-fanatische" can be seen as 'Funds-Fanatischen' written in the Alemannic dialect, a German dialect spoken in Switzerland mainly. The word has a structural pattern that resembles the traditional VSO word order in the German language.

The word 'funds' ('funds') is the noun, indicating a plural subject. In this sentence, 'funds' is contrasted with 'fanatischen' ('fanatischen' in dialect), which is the vocative plural of 'fanatisch', meaning 'fanatical'.

'Fanatischen,' itself, sounds rather consonant with Germanic languages. The words 'funds' and 'fanatischen' exhibit a similar ending, which is common in similar languages like German, Dutch, and English. The VSO consonance is also noticeable here, in which a Vowels (S) followed by a Consonants (OV) word order is followed.</s>
doorsta, doorreisd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "doorsta-doorreisd" do show consonance.

Justification:
Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within the same word. In the given Dutch words "doorsta-doorreisd," the consonant "d" is repeated at the end of both words. While it's not a perfect example of consonance (due to the word boundary between "door" and "sta" and the single consonant "d" at the start), the repetition of consonant "d" counts for consonance in this case.</s>
ontruimt, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || To check if these Dutch words show consonance, I will analyze their structures and sound elements.

1. "ontruimt" (the past tense of the verb "ontruimen," meaning "to evacuate" or "to empty"):
 - "on-" (a prefix) + "truim-" (a compound consisting of "trui" meaning "garment" or "apron," and "em-" meaning "to throw off")
 - Consonant clusters: "on-" + "truim-" (vrrrrrrrr)
 - No "ee," "oo," or vowel cluster-based rhyme.

2. "ordende" (meaning "order" or "arrangement"):
 - "or-" (a prefix) + "dende" (a base forming nouns, where "de" is a Dutch gender marker for masculine and neuter nouns)
 - Consonant clusters: "or-"
 - No "ee," "oo," or vowel cluster-based rhyme.

These two words don't show a strong sense of consonance since they do not rhyme using "ee," "oo," or vowel cluster-based rhymes. However, if we look at the compound structures (the prefixes and the compound parts), there's some level of consonance within the words themselves. Both words have similar beginning sounds, starting with the "tru" in "ontruim." The only thing that
doodsprentjes, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words have similar consonant sounds in them, which is a common aspect of consonance in poetry. The first word, "doodsprentjes," has a "-do-" and "-sp-" sound, and the second word, "invul," has a "-v-" sound similar to the first.</s>
ingestorte, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not exhibit consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device in which a series of similar consonant sounds are used in close proximity. However, in these words, the consonant sounds (t and a in "ingestorte" and "aanvijl") are distributed randomly across the words. There is no sequence of identical consonants. This makes these words appear as different words – not as an example for consonance. 

While it is possible that someone might refer to them as such if used in a larger context which would give a hint of consonance (such as in a list of similar words or phrases), on their own, they do not exhibit consonance. Thus, they are not a case study for the consonance literary device.</s>
verjaren, varieer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech which occurs when the speaker uses the same consonant sound in consecutive words. In the words "verjaren" (to age) and "varieer" (to vary), the consonant sounds 'v' in 'verjaren' and 'v' in 'varieer' are different. Thus, according to this definition, these words do not show consonance.</s>
collecte, klokt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
uremie, armee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Justification: The word pair "uremie-armee" consists of a compound word, "uremie," meaning "uremia," which shares a similar consonant arrangement as the first word "uremie." The other word, "armee," also features a consonant pattern which is similar to "uremie." This repetition of consonants makes the word pair consonantous.</s>
ontruimt, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance in the given Dutch words "ontruimt-nadook". The phrase contains the words "ontruimt" (vacate) and "nadook" (later). The use of the letter "t" and the suffix "-nadook" creates both alliteration and consonance; the "t" sound is repeated, and the "o" sound is also repeated in "nadook."</s>
rook, rik, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. They both have the same consonant at the end of the word, specifically "k" in each word. Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when there is a repetition of consonant sounds within a phrase. In this case, both words end with the "k" sound and thus exhibit consonance.</s>
rotacisme, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

In Dutch, words can indeed show consonance by having the same or similar consonant sounds in neighboring or remote vowel sounds. "Rotacisme" only shares the sound with "treknet" in the word "rotacisme-treknet", but it is not a true consonance. "Rotacisme" has the sounds ററ്റാസിம്‌ (r - o - t - a - s - i - m) at various points, and "treknet" shares the sound ററ്റാപ്‌ററ്റ്സം (r - o - t - a - p - a - t - r - t) at the final vowel "t". While it's nice that there are vowel sounds that share consonant sounds with slight variations, "consonance" as a term does not apply to the Dutch language as it applies to poetic and linguistic structures of other languages. In poetry or literature, some Dutch authors may use consonance intentionally, but for just being words, these two don't share "consonance."</s>
wegdruip, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the phrase "wegdruip-dienstroosters" does show consonance. 

To explain this further, let's break down the phrase into its individual words:
1. "weg" (way)
2. "druip" (to drizzle or drip)
3. "dienst" (service)
4. "roosters" (cattle, domestic fowl)

Each of these words has at least two consonants in a row. In the first and third words, it's "weg-dienst," the second and fourth words have "druip-roosters," and "dienstroosters" has "d-r-o-o-s-t-e-e-r-s." This consonant pattern makes the phrase sound pleasing to the ear and reinforces the flow of the language, thus exhibiting consonance.</s>
handicaprace, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "handicaprace-zuursel" do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of neighboring consonant sounds in a line of poetry. In these words, there is no such repetition of consonant sounds; rather, there are some repeated consonants which makes the word "handicaprace-zuursel" seem like a made-up or incorrect combination of words. Thus, the words are phonemically consonant, but not in the context of consonance in poetry.</s>
uitwijst, twisten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "uitwijst-twisten" show consonance. 

The justification for this is that both words have the letter "s" in the middle, followed by "w." In the first word, "uit-", "wijst-," and "twist-" are formed by consonants, whereas in the second word, "uit-" and "-twisten" are created purely from consonants. The "w" sound in each word further helps to create a similar sound, also known as consonance.</s>
ziedt, zetten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "ziedt-zetten" do not show consonance. Although the words have similar sounds with a "zh" (z/z) and "tt" (t/t) cluster in each, they do not have any other internal correspondences or rhymes.

Additionally, the words don't share any patterned repetitions of individual consonants or vowels across syllables, which would typically be a sign of consonance.</s>
weetgierigste, weetgraagst, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words weetgierigste and weetgraagst do not show consonance because they do not share the same consonants in the syllables.

In the word "weetgierigste," the consonants in the syllables "weet" (weh-t), "gie" (gee), and "rig" (rir-g) are different and do not correspond to any pattern in the word "weetgraagst."

Therefore, they do not exhibit consonance because they do not share the same consonants in the syllables they form. Consonance occurs when the same consonant sound or similar patterns of consonant sounds are repeated within a word or sequence of words.</s>
piepjongst, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "piepjongst-zuursel," the '-j' and '-s' sounds correspond to each other, as they are the last letter in "jongst" (tallest) and "zuursel" (bad breath). The consonance between the two words is created by the repetition of the identical consonant sound.</s>
kina, koen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance between the Dutch words "kina-koen."

In this case, both words contain the consonant sequence "kin" followed by another consonant. The structure of the words is similar, displaying consonance. The words "kina" and "koen" are related concepts, which contribute to the overall flow and balance of these words.</s>
potteus, pythische, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
ijsschuit, scheten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ijsschuit-scheten" do show consonance. The consonance in these words is created by the alternation of the voiced stops (the /s/ in both places are "voiced" sound, pronounced as /sz/ in Dutch), and the palatalized voiceless stops (/ts/) in both words. The pattern of using these voiced stops and palatalized stops in these Dutch words creates the consonance.</s>
ontdekken, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Justification:
- "Ontdekken", which means "to discover", has the following consonant sounds: "d" "k" "k" "n".
- "Invul", which means "to fill or complete", has the following consonant sounds: "i" "v" "l".

Although the individual consonants present in both words are common across both, none of these individual consonants follow the same sequence in both the words, as "ontdekken" starts with an "o" but "invul" starts with an "i". Hence, they do not show consonance.</s>
doorreisd, drieste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "doorreisd" and "drieste" display consonance.

In this case, "doorreisd" has four letters and "d" is repeated once in each word. "D" is repeated twice in "drieste," and both words consist of five letters. So, considering the consecutive repetition of the same consonant sound, it is reasonable to conclude that these Dutch words show consonance.</s>
protte, apparaat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Consonance is a poetic technique in which two or more vowel sounds are repeated, and two or more consonant sounds are repeated, and the repetition often creates an emphasis on the repeated sound.

In the given Dutch words "protte-apparaat," 'prot' and '-apparaat' share three consonant sounds: 'p', 'r', and 't'. The vowels are not identical, but they are similar (e, i in 'protte' and e, in '-apparaat'). This kind of consonance is known as geminates-geminates consonance.</s>
aanvetten, navet, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. Consonance is a figure of speech where certain consonant sounds are repeated within a phrase or word group. In Dutch, these words may instead show alliteration, where identical consonants appear at the beginning of words or a sequence of words. In this case, "aanvetten" (meaning to pin) and "navet" (meaning a mishap or blunder) have different consonant patterns that do not exhibit consonance.</s>
know-how, inhuwen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gedocht", "gedoken", and "trokken" show consonance. Consonance is a literary technique in which two or more words in a line or a text have their consonants in common. In Dutch, words share consonants more frequently in stressed syllables, which creates a sense of unity and rhythm.

Ex: In "gedocht", "gedoken," and "trokken", the common consonants are 'd' in stressed syllables(e in "gedocht", u in "gedoken", en "trokken"). Hence, these words demonstrate consonance and rhyming. This technique adds harmony and coherence to the language expression, particularly in poetry and songs.</s>
handelwijs, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
overaccentuering, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes and No answer:

Analyzing the words given: "overaccentuering-indeuk" 

Consonance is a poetic device where consecutive consonants sounds are repeated. In this phrase, we analyze the two words:

1. "overaccentuering" - This word has two consecutive consonants, 'o' and 'v', in the middle of the word. The consonant combination 'v' in the Dutch language is the voiced or semi-vowel sound [ف]. So technically, there is consonance in this word but with a special kind of consonance called "semi-vowel consonance".

2."indeuk" - This word has two consecutive consonants, 'i' and 'n', at the end of the word. These consonant sounds are similar and are found in many Dutch words. So, this word also shows consonance.

Overall, the given phrase contains the features of word consonance but with the exception of the semi-vowel sound 'v'. Therefore, the answer to the question "Do these Dutch words show consonance?" is both Yes (for the consonant sounds in 'overaccentuering') and No (due to the presence of semi-vowel sound [ف] which is an exception to the 'consonance rule').</s>
bedienaars, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "bedienaars-ontduik" do not show consonance. Consonance refers to when consecutive consonant sounds are repeated. In "bedienaars-ontduik," however, the consonant sequence is "-ie-" ("bedienaars" has "ie" and "ontduik" has "ie," which is not the same as two other identical consonants in a series). Therefore, these words do not exhibit consonance, but you could argue that they have a consonant echo to some extent.</s>
jatte, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.</s>
detacheer, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheren" (to detach) and "invullen" (to fill in) show some consonance.

Justification: The endings "eren" in "detacheren" and "ellen" in "invullen" both end with the -len- and -eren- consonant clusters, which create a similar sound when pronounced. Additionally, the shared consonant 'v' in "invul" and "fillen" creates the illusion of further consonant matching between the words, even though the vowels are different.</s>
oestrus, satyrs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

The consonants sound similar in both words, with the "o" and "s" sounds in "oestrus" and the "s" and "r" sounds in "satyrs." The similarities in the consonant sounds create an underlying similarity in sound, making the words share an element of consonance.</s>
versmallen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words show consonance.

The words versmallen and nadook do show consonance, as both words begin with the consonant "s." This contributes to a sense of unity when the two words are put together in the phrases "versmallen-nadook" and "de versmallen-nadook," where "de" is the definite article "the." Additionally, "s" and "n" are pronounced in a similar manner, increasing the effect of consonance between the pair of words.</s>
duif, trompetbomen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "trompetbomen" show consonance. 

In both words, you can identify a series of similar consonant sounds that create a rhythm and repetition. To analyze consonance in Dutch, you look for words with more than one syllable, which often have similar-sounding consonants, such as t ("t" in "duif," "trompet," "b" in "bomen"). This technique is known as consonance. In the given example, "duif" and "trompetbomen," the repetition of the /t/ sound strengthens the connection between the two words.</s>
dubt, adept, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "dubt-adept" show consonance. This occurs when there is a repetition or proximity of consonants in adjacent or nearby sounds, contributing to the overall phonetic and rhythmic pattern of the word. In this case, the repeated "b-d" or "d" sound creates the consonance between "dubt" and "adept".</s>
struise, satyrs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "struise-satyrs" show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech in which consecutive consonant sounds are repeated. In the given words "struise-satyrs," the consecutive consonant sounds "str" and "rs" are repeated, thus demonstrating consonance. This is an example of onomatopoeia, as it mimics the sound structure of the words, which are the names of two mythical creatures that can be considered satyrs. Satyrs are imaginary beings in Greek mythology who are often depicted as half-man, half-goat.</s>
zenuwpijn, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. While the words have similar phonetic structures (mostly identical consonant clusters), consonance is not present in the given words as they do not exhibit regular or rhytmic correspondence between the consonant sounds in both words. In other words, the consonants in zenuwpijn and voorlichtte don't follow similar patterns, nor does one word's consonants sound similar to the consonants in the other word.</s>
etnisch, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-kwintalen" show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds at the end of stressed syllables in a sequence of words. In this case, both words have the "-ch-" sound at the end (spelled as "-tjen" in "etnisch" and "-kalen" in "kwintalen" respectively). This repetition of final consonants in related words can create a sense of musicality or rhythmic flow in the phrase. So, the consonance is present in the given words.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

The first word, "loopgravenstellingen," consists of the following consonants: "l," "p," "t," "t," "g," "s," "t," "e," "n," "t," "e," "n," "g," "i," "n," "g," "e," "s," and "t." The pattern of consonants is somewhat regular, with the majority of the syllables ending in a single consonant.

However, the second word, "etnisch," contains just two consonants, "t," and "s," in the order "t," "n," "s," and "h." While this pattern shows a sense of consonance within the word, it does not meet the standard of consonance applied to longer phrases.

Overall, the two words do not show enough consonance on the scale usually applied to Dutch words.</s>
zondagssluiting, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zondagssluiting" and "voorlieg" show consonance. 

Consonance, as a poetic device in literature, is primarily characterized by repeating a similar consonant sound in close proximity to each other in a phrase, sentence, or even word. In the given Dutch words, both examples exhibit a similarity in the final few letters, resulting in a pleasing sound.

1. "zondagssluiting" – The word concludes with "sluiting" which is a consonant cluster that involves "sl."

2. "voorlieg" – In this case, the word "voorlieg" similarly ends with "lig" which is also a consonant cluster (with "l" as the common sound).

Hence, these two words indeed show consonance as they share this characteristic in their endings.</s>
toereikend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
dierbaardere, doorborduur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In the Dutch language, as in many other languages, consonance is a poetic technique of using similar or rhyming consonant sounds at the end of words or within syllables. In your example, "dierbaardere (meaning 'more frightening')" shares the /b/ sound with "doorborduur (meaning 'embroidery')", which gives the words the same ending consonant. This creates a rhyme and can be an effective way to make a poem or writing piece more appealing and interesting.</s>
binnenstormde, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "binnestormde-wegdruip" show consonance. To understand why, let me break down each word and give you some examples of how the consonants work together to create harmonious sounds:

- Binnenstormde: "Binnen" means 'within' or 'inside' and has a /b/ sound at the beginning. The prefix "binn-" combines with the suffix "-ende" to form a more complex onset /innde/. The resulting consonant pattern is /bɪnɑnəndə/.

- Weg-druip: The suffix "-druip" is the past participle of the verb "druipen" which means 'to drop' or 'to pour'. The word therefore concludes with the /p/ sound. The prefix "weg-" (meaning 'away') makes consonance with "-druip" by creating a similar onset /ˈwɛgdruip/ in these instances.

The consonant harmony in these Dutch words contributes to their overall aural sense of coherence by maintaining similar patterns of consonant sounds and patterns.</s>
turfvuren, tarifeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In both words "turfvuren" and "tarifeer", the first consonant is 't'. This is a common feature of Dutch language which is known as "consonance". Consonance occurs when a sequence of consonant sounds appear in a group, often without a vowel or with a very brief vowel sound.</s>
trompetbomen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "trompetbomen-aanvijl" do show consonance. The words both have the same vowel sound in the middle syllables (trom... and aan...), while the consonant sounds change (p in trompet and v in aanvijl). This creates a sense of repeated sounds, known as consonance, which can be a poetic device used to emphasize and provide structural balance in a sentence or phrase.</s>
kerkerende, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || To determine if the Dutch words show consonance, we analyze the sounds or phonemes of individual words and the sounds or phonemes present in a pattern or scheme that resembles consonances.

In the Dutch phrase "kerkerende-ontruimt", we can identify the following sounds or phonemes:
- kerker: KER, ker, KER, erre (ending)
- ende: en, ende
- ontruimt: on, ON, tru, TRU, im

If we compare these individual elements, we can see that they match closely in terms of consonance and vowels: 
- KER and ON both involve a voiced consonant (K and ON), followed by a long vowel (E and oon), and finally a voiceless consonant (R and N).

Since these Dutch words share these similarities in terms of consonance and vowel sounds, I can say that there is consonance in these words. So the answer is Yes.</s>
karteer, korter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of these words have consonance as they share similar consonant sounds at the ends: 

1. "karteer" (to survey) shares the 'r' sound at the end.
2. "korter" (short) shares the 't' and 'r' sounds at the end.

This is a type of consonance called "sibilance," which involves consonant sounds, such as 's', 't', 'r', or 'l', being repeated or clustered together at the ends of words. It adds to the rhythm and sonic appeal of a phrase or sentence in poetry and helps make the writing more memorable.</s>
overlig, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words show consonance.

- "overlig" and "ontduik" both end with the consonant "C."
- The syllable structure remains consistent, with "ol-" in both words that sounds similar.

Therefore, they show consonance in their ending consonants "C."</s>
overaccentuering, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "overaccentuering" and "wegdruip," the consonant sounds occur in a consistent pattern:

• "over" and "weg" both start with the consonant "vo"
• "accentuering" includes the sounds "ks", "t", and "ng"
• "druip" has the "p" and "r" sounds.

These similarities between the consonant sounds contribute to the overall consonance present in the Dutch words.</s>
park, prijken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words contain the /k/ sound, as it appears in the word "park" in 'park-prijken,' and also in the root of the verb "prijken," which means 'stretch'. The presence of this /k/ sound creates a consonant pattern that may contribute to the appearance of consonance in the two words.</s>
vuilpersleiding, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

To understand the meaning of "consonance," it is helpful to know that the terms that follow the '-ly' ending often represent a direct translation of English words. They are often repeated to provide emphasis or reinforce the meaning.

In the Dutch phrases "vuilpersleiding-invul" and "vuilpersleiding-kast," "vuilpersleiding" is a combination of "vuil," "persleiding," and "invul." "Vuil" means "dirty" or "filth," "persleiding" means "sewer drain" or "sewer pipe," and "invul" or "trap" literally means "stopper" or "capsule" as in something that holds something together or holds in a liquid.

The Dutch words "invul" and "kast" together become "invulkast," which is a combination of "invul," or "stopper," and "kast," which means "box" in Dutch. This seems to be a contraption of some kind where water goes in, likely because of some kind of dirty or dirty liquid (from something like a "dirty pipe").

These words use similar consonant sounds (v and l) in different positions but do not have identical consonant patterns. In other words, they show some consonance because they use similar consonants, but they are not identical or completely the same. Overall, the use of similar and repeating consonants provides consistency in these phrases and highlights the English-
psychoanalytici, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici-jut" do not show consonance. In linguistics, consonance is a type of sound pattern where identical or similar consonant sounds are repeated or nearly repeated in two words. 

In the provided example "psychoanalytici-jut," the consonant sounds "ps" and "j" are similar, but they are not identical, so consonance doesn't apply. The word "psychoanalytici" already has an "s" sound, which is not repeated in "jut."

"psychoanalyticijut" might be closer, as it does have identical consonant sounds "ps" and "j." However, that's not the original phrase.

Also considering that -ut is a common suffix in Dutch, it's not really a consonant similarity here. It's more a common structure.</s>
zondagssluiting, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

"zondagssluiting-rotacisme" contains the consonance of "ss-ll-tt-mm-ee" and other consonant sounds throughout the words.</s>
Jut, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Explanation: The term "consonance" in linguistics refers to similarities between sounds in different words. The word "jut" matches with the word "duif" in the Dutch language, which ends in the consonant "f." This creates a sense of congruity between the two words, even though they do not share a vowel pattern in the way other closely related words might.</s>
theekop, uitkip, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "theekop" (teacup) and "uitkip" (outcrowd) have a vowel pattern that contributes to consonance. Although the words have different meanings, they both start with the same consonant (T) and have a pattern of alternating vowels, which results in a rhythm and sound resemblance.</s>
piepjongst, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance. Although "piepjongst-uitreikend" contains some consonant sounds (p, j, t), the words lack consonance as the consonants are spread out randomly and without any clear pattern or relation. Word consonance typically refers to words with a significant number of consonant sounds in almost the same order, giving the impression of a strong consonant pattern.</s>
zetterijen, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

The Dutch language, like many other languages, often employs consonance to create a rhythm or pattern in words. In the phrase "zetterijen-detacheer," both "zetterijen" and "detacheer" (although spelled differently due to phonetic transcription) have a similar consonant pattern: t-t-t-t-h-r-t. This consonant pattern makes it easier for the ear to recognize and can add a musical and memorable quality to spoken or written texts.

In English, we might say: "Stutter-utter, stutter-utter." Here, "stutter-utter" still uses the same consonant pattern, albeit with different vowel sounds. By using similar consonant patterns in language, writers and speakers can create a sense of rhythm, enabling the listener or reader to better recall and understand the intended message.</s>
kielvlak, framepjes, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

The literal translation of "kielvlak" is "keel flat" and "framepjes" translates to "frame cards." Now, coming to the word that carries a common/similar sound in both words - "k" in kielvlak and "c" in framespjes doesn't show any sound alike as it's all different. Hence, they don't show consonance.</s>
vilten, volta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'vilten' and 'volta' do show consonance. These words both start with a 'V' and an 'L' sound, and the following consonant in each word creates a pattern that resembles the word that comes before it. Additionally, 'volta' is a compound word that incorporates the first two letters of 'volt' and gives it a sonorous quality.</s>
kopietjes, kapotjas, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

The given Dutch words (kopietjes-kapotjas) do not exhibit consonance. In this case, the word 'kopietjes' contains consonants 'ko' and 'pi' present in the words 'kop' and 'ietjes'. The word 'kapotjas' doesn't consist of any consonance sound. Therefore, they don't follow the 'consonance' principle. According to the definition of 'consonance,' words with similar or consonant sounding endings are considered to be consonant. The suffix 'tjas' doesn't bring new consonant sounds and is only pronounced in a slightly different way. Thus, there isn't an explicit consonance present in these Dutch words.</s>
welbedachte, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch word pair does show consonance as both words contain the consonant "b" which occurs in the same place in both words.</s>
welhebbende, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "welhebbende" and "joysticks" do show consonance, as both words contain the consonant "s." Additionally, the word "welhebbende" has the consonant "w," which is present in "joysticks." This type of sound similarity is known as consonance.</s>
planimetreer, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || In the given Dutch words "planimetreer-ingestort," the only consonant that is repeated is "r." However, this repetition of consonants does not create consonance in the normal sense as it is not in a rhyme scheme, and the consonant isn't repeated in a way that gives a musical or poetic effect. Thus, the words do not show consonance.</s>
iebel, obool, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. The rime scheme, or pattern of repeated consonant sounds, between the syllables "Ie" and "O" in the words "iebel" and "obool" creates the consonance.</s>
roken, erica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "roken" and "erica" show consonance. 

In this example, both words start with the same consonant sound (rhyming), making them instances of consonance. The word "roken" means "to smoke", while "erica" comes from the Greek word "erix" and is the name of a genus of plants, including the "rose erica." The consonant "-k-" is the only constant sound in both words.</s>
roemen, armee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "roemen-armee" show consonance.</s>
toerekent, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

Toeree+ken+t-n-a-dook: 
I will split the phrase into syllables: Too-ree-ken-t (consonant sounds) -na-dook (no vowels except a silent 'a,' creating vowel-less sounds) 

This pattern creates both r- and tr- sounds which is why this type of pattern is referred to as consonance.</s>
lik, leuke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
munterij, monitor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "munterij" and "monitor" show consonance. The root of both words begins with the consonant "m-" and continues with different but related meanings - "munterij" meaning "mischief" and "monitor" meaning "overseer". This creates a sense of similarity in terms of their sounds. In literal terms, they might not appear similar, but they share a common initial consonant, which gives them a slight similarity both in sound and meaning. Therefore, they display consonance.</s>
wegdruip, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip-esthetica" show consonance. 

I analyze the words "wegdruip" and "esthetica" separately. "Weg" is a noun in Dutch that means "road" or "way." "Druip" is a verb meaning "to drip." Combining these words, "wegdruip" forms an analogy for the verb "to drop off."

"Esthetica" is a noun in Dutch referring to the study of beauty or aesthetics. The "-a" ending is common in Dutch words referring to abstract concepts or qualities. When we combine this word with "weg," we get the compound noun "wegesthetica."

The two nouns "wegesthetica" and "wegdruip" share the similarities in their endings "-esthetica" and "-druip" creating an inherent structural consonance. Though there's no direct anagram formed, the similarities in sounds are present between them which is a form of consonance. Therefore, the two words indeed show consonance.</s>
loopgravenstelling, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loopgravenstelling-detacheer" show consonance.

Explanation: The words "loopgravenstelling-detacheer" have multiple consecutive consonants, specifically the sequence "gg" in "loopgravenstelling" (moat or trench system) and "tt" in "detacheer" (detach). This characteristic of the Dutch language is known as consonance.</s>
omstikken, messteek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These Dutch words do show consonance as they both end with the same consonant sound ("t" in both words). This is the kind of consonance referred to as a consonantal or a medial consonant consonance. It occurs when two or more words share a common consonant sound, usually near or at the end of the word.</s>
spoorrat, sproeten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "spoorrat-sproeten" do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a poem or a sentence. Although both words start with the letter 's', the 'r' and 't' in "spoorrat" and "sproeten" sound different, and therefore they do not show consonance in terms of sound repetition. Moreover, the meaning of the words is different, as "spoorrat" means 'rat trap' and "sproeten" means 'corn cobs' in English. This distinction also prevents the words from showing consonance in terms of meaning. The words could be considered to have both alliteration and assonance as they start with 'S', a voiceless and voiced alveolar plosive consonant respectively, and have a sonorant /ə/ sound, respectively, in the middle of the words. However, as consonance deals with the repetition of specific consonant sounds, these words do not qualify as they lack the same specific consonant sounds repeating in their structures.</s>
kun, koen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do show consonance. In "kun-koen," the words "kun" and "koen" have similar consonant sounds. The word "kun" has the consonants "k" and "n" while "koen" has the consonants "k" and "n" as well. This similarity in the consonant sounds creates a consonance between the two words.</s>
zondagssluiting, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the given words "zondagssluiting-lawinegevaar," the consonant sounds "s" and "n" are repeated, creating a sense of similar consonant clusters, thus exhibiting consonance.</s>
toer, teer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toer-teer" show consonance. In linguistics, consonance refers to the musicality of sounds in words, which creates a rhythmic pattern. In this case, "toer" ends in the consonant sound /r/ and "teer" starts with a consonant sound /t/ which echoes in similar consonant sounds creating the rhythm.</s>
nadook, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

Both words show consonance because they end with the same consonant sound (the "k" in "nadook" and "bagatellen"). This is a common technique in Dutch and many other languages to create rhyme or give a sense of similarity between words.</s>
kielvlakken, meridionaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words do not show consonance.

In linguistics, consonance implies a repetition of consonants in different sections of a word, without necessarily altering the phonetic aspects of the word.

Here are the two Dutch words and their consonant clusters:

1. kielvlakken (consonants: k-l-f) - This word does not show any consonance, as it consists of three different consonants and does not repeat any of them.

2. meridionaal (consonants: m-r-d-n-l) - This word does show consonance because the last three letters form a consonant cluster (mnld). However, the word itself does not have any similar consonant clusters in its other positions within the word.

So, kielvlakken displays no consonance because it does not contain any identical consonant clusters in different sections, unlike meridionaal, which has a vowel 'l' after the consonant 'meridio' as in the word 'mersch', indicating a consonant cluster 'ln'. Thus, 'meldienaal' is more clearly phonetically marked due to the consonant clusters m-l-n-l with a consonant 'l' following another consonant.</s>
gekaaide, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "gekaaide-etnisch" does show some consonance. In this case, the consonance comes from the repeated "ks" sound in the words "gekaaide" and "etnisch." Although this level of consonance is not particularly strong, it can still be considered a form of consonance.</s>
kielvlak, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak-voorlieg" show consonance.

In both words, the same consonant (P-L) appears in the second position of the word, and the consonant also appears as the first phoneme in the following syllable. This creates a rhythmic pattern or sound connection between the two words, which is characteristic of consonance.</s>
joysticks, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance because they share two of the same consonants at the end of the word: "j" and "k." This pattern of having the same consonant in two adjacent syllables is known as consonance.</s>
opeisten, pust, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'opeisten' and 'pust' show consonance as both words share a similar consonant sounds. In English, this is described as 'consonantal repetition' which is a common poetic device used to create musicality and rhythm in written text.</s>
schreeuweriger, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "schreeuweriger" and "statica," show consonance because both words end with the same consonant sounds: the "r" in "schreeuweriger" and the "s" in "statica." This type of sound-symbolic relationship creates a rhythm and unity in the structure of the sentence or phrase.</s>
schreeuwerigere, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schreeuwerigere-nadook" show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech that involves repeated consonant sounds at the ends of words or syllables in a phrase, sentence, or verse. In the given words, "schreeuwerigere" and "nadook," the repeated consonants "ee" and "oo" at the ends create consonance. This gives the words a musical effect and can make the passage more appealing to the ear. Additionally, by creating a contrast in the word sounds, they add emphasis to the message being conveyed.</s>
framepjes, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "framepjes-wegdruip" show consonance.

Justification:
The word "framepjes" starts with two consecutive consonant sounds (f followed by r) followed by another consonant sound (p) and another consonant sound (j) which is a less usual sequence in Dutch. The word "wegdruip", also contains similar consonant sounds "w", "g" then "d" and finally "r" concluding with "uip". Together, these words have 7 consonants which are more than the average. Therefore, these words do show consonance.</s>
etnisch, handelwijs, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-handelwijs" show a degree of consonance. Consonance occurs when two or more words have a significant number of consonant sounds in common, either by having the same consonant sounds or by sharing similar consonant patterns. In the given phrase, the words "etnisch" and "handelwijs" both include repeated consonant sounds, creating a subtle auditory rhythm that contributes to the consonance.</s>
smadelijkst, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Both words, "smadelijkst" and "ontroomt", are consonant-rich in terms of the sounds they present. They both have similar patterns in their consonant sounds (S-M-D-L-ST in "smadelijkst" and O-N-T-R-T in "ontroomt"). This similarity plays a role in both words consonancing with one another.

Consonance is a literary technique where words with similar consonant sounds are used close together to create musical rhythm. By having words with these same consonant sounds close to one another, they create a harmonious rhythm, or consonance. This technique can add depth and beauty to a written or spoken passage.

In this case, both words "smadelijkst" and "ontroomt" show consonance, as they have the same patterns in their consonant sounds. Though it's not exactly the same consonantal pattern as found in "smadelijkst," "ontroomt" shows its own unique consonance by having the pattern "O-N-T-R-T." Both words make use of consonance to create an enhanced reading experience.</s>
wegdropen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in a sequence of words, usually with similar or related meanings. In the Dutch words you mentioned, "wegdropen" means to drop and "voorlig" means to lean. There are no consonant sounds that repeat together in these words.</s>
beschietend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beschietend" and "indeuk" show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device where consonant sounds are repeated in words or phrases. In these words, the repeated sound is "ch," which appears in "beschietend" and "indeuk." This repeated sound contributes to the overall musicality and rhythm of the words. Although the words don't share the same ending consonant, such as in the case of "d" at the end of "beschietend," the repetition of the "ch" sound is an example of consonance.</s>
roekoe, rik, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words "roekoe-rik" show consonance, as both words have the same two consonants (RK) in the same order in both words. This creates a musical and pleasing effect on the ear, which is a common characteristic of consonance in poetry or song.</s>
detacheer, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In this case, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "versvoeten" both exhibit consonance. Consonance, in the linguistic field, is a rhetorical figure where like consonant sounds in close proximity are repeated or echoed. Both words consist of the consonant sounds "t" and "s."

The Dutch phrase detacheer versvoeten means 'to detach feet' or 'to foot loose' which can be related to loosening one's feet from a fixed position, often associated with dancing or walking comfortably.</s>
duurde, doordoe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do show consonance. 

The Dutch word "duurde" means "lasted" or "to last," and "doordoe" means "throughout." Both words end in "d" and start with "d." The similar consonant starts and ends the words, which creates consonance. Consonance is a poetic device that uses repeated consonant sounds in two or more words. In this case, the repeated "d" consonant sound creates a repeating pattern that gives the phrase a musical quality.</s>
gaand, genutte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "gaand-genutte" show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when two or more similar sounding consonant letters occur in succession. Both words, "gaand-genutte," feature the consonant "d" that appears three times in a row. This pattern creates a sense of rhythm and musicality in the language, which is one way of using consonance to enhance the overall effect of a text.</s>
uremie, roemen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "uremie-roemen," do show consonance as both words end in the letters "e" and "o." Consonance is a figure of speech that involves using similar consonant sounds (phonemes). In this case, the repetition of the consonant "e" and "o" in each word contributes to the overall similarity and musicality of the phrase.</s>
bult, beoliet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance in these Dutch words "bult-beoliet". These words share the consonant sounds in the beginning and end of the words. 

"bult" and "beoliet" have an "L" sound in the second syllable, which creates a common sound element. This makes the two words sound similar when spoken. This linguistic element of sound repetition often contributes to consonance in language constructs.</s>
parament, pruimend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "parament" and "pruimend" do not show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when a pattern of consonant sounds is repeated in the text, typically within a single line or stanza. Here, the two Dutch words that you provided do not exhibit this pattern. Although both words have the "p" sound, they do not occur in the same word, thus they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
jut, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "jut-rotacisme" do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a stress syllable. In English, stressed syllables are marked with a stress mark ( /ˈ/) and the vowel sound. Let me explain further. The word "jut" has a short "u" sound (as in the word "put") as the stressed syllable, but you added an extra "c" between the vowels which makes the syllable irregular. So, the syllable you mentioned is not stress syllable but it is a syllable consisting of consonants which makes sense. But overall both words "jut" and "rotacisme" are more like homophones not consonance.</s>
parament, pramend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In both words, the final consonant is the same (m and n), which contributes to the consonance between the words. Consonance occurs when two or more words in a sequence share one or more consonants in their final or penultimate syllable. Both "parament" and "pramend" share the same m/n consonant blend, making them examples of consonance in Dutch.</s>
pleura, pelorie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words "pleura" and "pelorie" do show consonance. Both words have a VVVV pattern, where V represents a consonant and three times the same consonant is used. In this case, both words have three identical consonants (p) in a row. So, they exhibit consonance, which is an aural effect in which similar consonant sounds form patterns or sounds that resemble each other, such as in language, music, or poetry. Although the words differ in word-endings (suffix "-ia" in pleura and "-erie" in pelorie), they share the similar VVVV pattern, which contributes to the overall feeling of consonance in the given word pair.</s>
etnisch, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-invallen" show consonance. 

The words exhibit a pattern of similar consonants - "n," "s," and "s." This consonance contributes to their rhyme and overall structure, making them appear harmonious and poetic in the context of the compound word.</s>
iemker, omkeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance. Both words share a similar pattern of consonants (IEMKER - OMKEREN) at the end, which creates a sense of harmony or rhythm. This is a common feature of poetry and can contribute to the beauty and appeal of the language.</s>
handelwijs, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "handelwijs" and "esthetica," show consonance as they both end in the consonant cluster "c," making them a rhyming pair. In Dutch, consonance is created when two or more words finish in the same consonant sound, which often reflects the meaning of the words.</s>
barnt, burend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "barnt-burend" show consonance. Both words contain the letter sequence "br-nr", which is repeated within the word. This type of repetition creates a similar sound or consonant pattern, making the words appear more connected in terms of sound and structure.</s>
afgrijzenwekkendere, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the given Dutch words "afgrijzenwekkendere-invul", both words share six consonant letters - 'a', 'f', 'g', 'r', 'i', and 'v'. This recurring consonant pattern creates the consonance effect in the words. The only difference between the two words is the final 'e' in the first word, which is different from 'u' in the second word.</s>
plecht, openlucht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "plecht" and "openlucht" show consonance.

Here's how the two words show consonance:

- Both words contain similar letters: p and l/t are the common vowels and c is the common consonant in both. 
- The initial consonant groups also sound alike: p in "plecht" and p in "openlucht".

Consonance is a rhetorical device that occurs when two or more words share a similar sound within the same syllable. In this case, both words satisfy this criterion; therefore, they show consonance.</s>
eiloof, elf, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "eiloof-elf" exhibit consonance, as both words share the "o" sound within the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern ("eil-o-off" in the first word and "elf" in the second word). The repeated consonant in this case provides a pleasing and consistent sound in the two words.</s>
kras, kruiassen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words 'kras-kruiassen' exhibit consonance as both words start with the same sounding initial consonant, "k". 

Consonance is an artistic device employed in poetic composition. It refers to the repetition of consonant sounds or sounds that are similar at close proximity, providing a rhythmic or melodic effect to the reader or listener. In these words, it creates an effect of similarity in pronunciation and rhythm.</s>
stek, staken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words exhibit consonance. Both "stek" and "staken" share the ending "-ken," which creates a pattern of repeating final vowel sounds and consonant combinations.</s>
schamp, schimpen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance as both words have a repeated consonant "sch-". Congruently, the words are similar in sound and structure. Consonance is a poetic device that uses repeated consonant sounds.</s>
onderligger, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "onderligger" and "statica" do show consonance. Both words have similar letter sounds, specifically the "st" sound in 'statica'. This device of repeating consonant letters to enhance a particular aspect of rhythm and sound is generally known as consonance.</s>
attentie, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie" (attention) and "ingestelde" (established), show consonance. Both words end with the consonant sound "d", creating a rhyming pattern and similarity in their endings.</s>
inwoon, aanwen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance. 

Justification: Although both words, "inwoon-aanwenden" and "inwoon-aanwenden," appear to share a common start (inwoon-), the words actually have different meanings (residing and settling in, versus residing and adapting):

'inwoon-aanwenden' means "residing and adapting" (residing in and getting accustomed to a place, a lifestyle, or a situation)

'inwoon-aanwenden' means "residing and settling in" (residing in a place and making the place your home)

In short, both words are correct but have different meanings, and they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
kerkerende, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
avondfeesten, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a literary technique that involves repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words, phrases, or lines. In the given words, there is no such repetition of consonant sounds, so they do not show consonance. The words "avondfeesten" and "voorlegt" don't have any consistent sounds at the ends of the words to suggest consonance.</s>
duif, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif-ontroomt" show consonance, as they both end with the same consonant "r". This consonant ending creates a satisfying sound and links the two words together.</s>
aorta's, rits, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "aorta's-rits" show consonance. 

Justification: 
The words have at least two consonants at the end which are either vowel-consonant groups like "r-t" or two consonants such as "r-s". This arrangement of consonants (or consonant pairs) creates a rhythm and sound pattern. In this case, "a-o-t-r-s" has consistent consonant patterns making it rhythmic, much like a similar pattern in English words like 'kot-tra' or 'sput-ter'. This suggests that the words demonstrate some level of consonance in their structure.</s>
ingestorte, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance because they have similar consonant sounds in the end of the words. Ingestorte and esthetiek both end with the consonant sound "t." This consonant similarity contributes to the overall consonance between the two words.</s>
staaf, stuf, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "staaf-stuf" do not display consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry, and in this case, "staaf-stuf" shares the consonant "f" as both ends of the word, but the actual vowel sounds between "staaf" and "stuf" are different, "staaf" ending on the vowel sound of "a" and "stuf" ending on "f". Hence, it doesn't form consonances.</s>
ontroomt, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt" and "indeuk" exhibit consonance.

In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a text, particularly when they are next to each other. Both "ontroomt" and "indeuk" share the consonant sound "t". Therefore, these Dutch words show consonance.</s>
zondagssluiting, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "zondagssluiting" and "zenuwpijn" show consonance because they have similar consonant sounds: 'ss' in "zondagssluiting" and 'nn' in "zenuwpijn." The vowel sounds in the words, however, do not fit the definition of consonance. The word "zondagssluiting" sounds like a musical term, which fits the definition of consonance to some extent, while "zenuwpijn" is quite common for anyone who suffers from nervous system pains.</s>
val, euvel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "val-euvel" show consonance. 

This consonance can be seen in the combination of the letters "val" present in both words. In Dutch, syllabic clusters (or sequences of pronunciation units called syllables) are often used, and in this case, "val" forms a part of both syllabic clusters. The sound of "val" can be extended between syllables, creating a recognizable consonant cluster between "euvel" in the first word and "val" in the second word. When you say both words, you may notice how the consonants are repeated - another sign of consonance in the language.</s>
verluchtten, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

The words "verluchtten-taswoning" both show consonance because they have similar consonant sounds at the ends of the respective words. 'Verluchten' translates to 'overshadow,' and 'taswoning' translates to 'bookshelf.' The ending '-ing' of both words is also similar. Consonance is a rhetorical device that creates a strong rhythm or musicality in language when words with similar consonant sounds are used in a sequence, and in this case, the consonance at the end of both words contributes to their unity, as if they are part of a single unit. This consonance helps to make the phrase "bookshelf of the overshadowed."</s>
brijnt, barnt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "brijnt" and "barnt" show consonance.

In this case, both words have the same consonant cluster "bn-," which adds to their syllabic balance and creates a sense of rhythm. The similarities in structure play a role in the repetition of the "bn" sound, which contributes to consonance. In the Dutch language, words with consonance are recognized and often have a pleasing sound.</s>
computeriseer, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words "computeriseer" and "nadook" show consonance. Both words have similar final consonant sounds, with "-r-" in the first word (similar to "c") and "-d-" in the second word (similar to "s").</s>
handelwijs, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Here's why:

"Handelwijs" is Dutch for "in a business-like manner." It does not have any specific consonant patterns that are repeated throughout the word.

"Ontruimt" is Dutch for "emptied." Again, there is no specific consonant pattern to be found in this word.

If a specific consonant pattern were present in both words (as could be the case with an -hr-, -ng-, or -lt- sound), then they might be said to exhibit consonance. However, the words do not share any such pattern. So, the answer is "No."</s>
duif, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "zuursel" show consonance, as they both end in the same consonant, 's', a voiced sibilant (sibilants are typically /s/). The consonance creates a pleasing sound and rhyme, which is one of the common linguistic devices used in poetry and songwriting.</s>
kreupelbossen, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the given Dutch words do not demonstrate consonance between the two words.

In this case, the words "kreupelbossen-voorlegt" contain two separate and unrelated concepts: "kreupelbossen" translates to "shady forests," and "voorlegt" is a compound word consisting of the prefix "voor-" meaning "for" and the verb "leggen" meaning "to put," resulting in "to set down somewhere." There is no discernible connection or theme between these two words that would suggest consonance in the way of similar letter sounds or patterns.</s>
wegdruip, satansboleten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "satansboleten" show consonance. 

Consonance occurs when two or more stressed syllables in a row have the same consonant sound at the end, either the same or similar consonant sound. In this case, both the words end with syllables with a "-s" sound, which makes them exhibit consonance.</s>
ontduik, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Justification: Words that share consonants in close proximity are said to show consonance. "Ontduik," which means "sneak out," and "taswoning," which means "wallet," don't have any shared consonants or similar consonant patterns in such close proximity as to be considered consonant-rich.</s>
wegdruip, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words demonstrate consonance, specifically through the "w" in "weg" and "evocerend." Consonance is a poetic technique where repetition of similar consonant sounds occurs in close succession within a line or verse. In this case, the "w" sound brings a certain degree of rhythm, alliteration, and emphasis to the words "wegdruip" and "evocerend," which could enhance their poetic impact.</s>
psychoanalytici, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words contain a similar pattern of consonants in nearly equal parts:

"psychoanalytici-kruisbessestruiken"

- psychoanalytici (same as "psychoanalytic")
- kruisbessestruiken (same as "crosse-beart thorns" or "crossbeard thorns")</s>
zetterijen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two Dutch words, "zetterijen" (meaning 'lock-ups') and "ontruimt" (meaning 'clear/empty'), exhibit consonance, or similar tonal qualities between adjacent letters (consonant clusters), in this case, the letter "t" at the end of both words. This phenomenon can further enhance the rhythm and musicality of the language, often referred to as sonorous consonance or "onomatopoeic" pronunciation. So, while they do not share exact consonant clusters, they still display a degree of consonance in the context of the Dutch language.</s>
zenuwpijn, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'zenuwpijn' and 'naduiken' display consonance. They both contain the consonant sounds t, n, and d at the end of their structures. 

Justification: Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in adjacent or closely-spaced syllables. In this case, the final consonant sounds /t/, /n/, and /d/ are repeated in syllables that are close to each other. This creates a sense of unity and rhythm in the words, contributing to their overall sound qualities.</s>
bedrijving, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bedrijving" (company) and "zenuwpijn" (nerve pain) show consonance in the words "bedrijvig" (busy) and "zenuw" (nerve). Both words share the ending "-z-" and "w-" consonant sounds, creating the consonance effect.</s>
toerekent, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

To explain with a bit of analysis:

- "toerekent" has 'k' at the beginning ('tor-kent'), 'r' in the middle ('-rek-en-t'), and 'k' at the end ('t-ork'), which form a pattern of 'k'.
- "vuilpersleiding" also contains 'k' in similar positions as "toerekent": 'v' at the beginning ('v-uil'), 's' before the '-k' sound (at the end of 'vuilpersleiding'), and 'l'- 'k' in the middle ('leiding-l-erk'). Thus, they indeed show consonance.
So, the answer is yes, as you noted in your question.</s>
schreeuwerigere, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words end in the same consonant sound: "ree" (as in tree) in "schreeuweriger" (more shrill) and "duik" (dive) in "ontduik." This consonance contributes to the overall sound and rhythm of the words, creating a memorable and impactful effect when combined.</s>
oppijpt, pepita, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech where like or consonant sounds are repeated in the same line of poetry. In this case, the two words "oppijpt" and "pepita" do not share any consonant sounds. The word "oppijpt" has two consecutive consonant sounds ("pp") and the word "pepita" has two consecutive consonant sound ("pp" in the first syllable and "ta" in the second syllable). Therefore, they do not represent consonance.</s>
logt, lichten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance due to the contrasting consonant sounds in the words.

- In "logt," the pronunciation of the "l" is a bilabial nasal ([ɮ]) and the "t" is a voiceless alveolar plosive ([t]).
- In "lichten," the pronunciation of the "l" is a bilabial nasal ([ɮ]) and the "t" is a voiceless alveolar plosive ([t]).</s>
zenuwpijn, generaalsepauletten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have consonance as they share similar beginning consonant sounds: "zenuw" in "zenuwpijn" and "generaal" in "generaalsepauletten".</s>
afkaad, affect, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of similar linguistic sounds, and both the words "afkaad" and "affect" exhibit consonance by including the 'f'sound (which is a voiceless alveolar fricative) in the consonant clusters 'kkf' in "afkaad" and the syllable 'F' in "affect." This sound repetition creates a rhythmic and musical effect, contributing to the consonance observed between the two words.</s>
piepjongst, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance. Both words contain the sequence of consonant letters "pj," "ts," "i," and "n." This consonant sequence creates a sense of rhythm, sound, and similarity in the two words. Additionally, the addition of the vowel "e" in the first word modifies the spelling of the preceding consonant sequence creating a difference in pronunciation but still preserving the overall consonance pattern.</s>
taswoning, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

The given words "taswoning-ordende" do not follow the rules of consonance in Dutch. Consonance usually refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds at the end of two or more words in the same sentence or line. In this case, both words share a distinct consonant sound at the end (in Dutch, 'w' and 'd' respectively), but there is no consistent pattern of ending consonants between them in the given sentence. The sentence structure and phonetics are different, which means that the words do not necessarily exhibit consonance based on regular linguistic principles in the Dutch language.</s>
nip, nopen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance because both words end with the same three consonants, "ipn." Consonance occurs when consecutive words or syllables within a word share the same or similar consonant sounds, creating a rhythmic and musical effect.</s>
satansboleten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a literary technique where repeated consonant sounds occur in a sequence within a line of verse. The words "satansboleten-ontduik" have a total of 22 letters and do not contain any consonant clusters or sequences that could be perceived as consonance. Therefore, they do not show consonance in line with the given definition.</s>
planimetreer, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimetreren" and "invul" show consonance, as they both end in the same sounding consonant (in this case, -r), giving them a similar rhythmic foot. The word structure and the repetition of the sound /r/ establishes consonance.</s>
omsingel, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "omsingel-voorlig" do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonantal sounds within a line of poetry. In Dutch, however, word order is more flexible and the sentence "omsingel-voorlig" does not follow a consistent consonantal pattern. The phrase does not have any clear consonance, therefore I'd say it lacks consonance in the context of poetry.</s>
jut, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-ontdekken" do show consonance, as "jut" and "ontdekken" share the same cluster of consonant sounds at the beginning, which enhances the word's musicality and emphasizes the consonantal similarities between the two individual words.</s>
piepjongst, wegdropen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || A: No.

These Dutch words do not show consonance. Their pronunciation is different. "Piepjongst" and "wegdropen" are homophones meaning "flap short" and "to let go" respectively in Dutch, which means that both words sound the same, but they represent different meanings and have different spelling. Therefore, these words do not form consonance.</s>
zenuwpijn, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance present in these Dutch words. Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words or within the middle of words. In this case, we see the following consonant sounds are repeated in these words: "n" in "zenuwpijn" and "o" in "ontruimt."</s>
oppijpten, pepita, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "oppijpten" and "pepita" do show consonance since both words share multiple consonant sounds, such as "p" and "t" at the beginning and "t" at the end. This type of sound-similarity is a defining element of consonance.</s>
bijten, bood, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "bijten" and "bood" show consonance. 

In the words "bijten" and "bood," the letter 'b' is present in both words, and it is the most common consonant in Dutch. This consonant sound is being repeated in both words. When a consonant sound is repeated more than once within a word or series of words, it is referred to as consonance. Therefore, in this case, the 'b' (or the voiced bilabial plosive sound) is making a consonant consonance in both words. 

So, while they may not both have the same word structure or rhyme, they do share the same consonant sound (voiced bilabial plosive sound) in two adjacent syllables. This creates an overall pattern or resonance in the word structures.</s>
inlosten, onlust, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Though both words, "inlosten" (restoring) and "onlust" (restlessness/unrest), share some vowel sounds (l, o, and n in "onlust"), they do not share any consonant sounds which are the most basic building blocks in language.

"Inlosten" has two consonants "n" and "o" before and after the vowels, and "onlust" has only one "l" and "s" consonant sounds. The lack of consonant sounds between the two words hinders an appreciation of consonance as a structural or phonetic relationship between the words. While they share vowel sounds, this doesn't mean they are consonantically related.

Therefore, strictly in terms of consonance, or the pleasing congruence between consonant sounds, the words do not show any significant consonance. However, they do share some phonaesthemes or 'hidden' vowel sounds, but not the actual consonant sounds.</s>
psychoanalytici, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psychoanalytici" and "vadervreugde" show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device used in poetry that involves the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words, phrases, or sentences. In the given words "psychoanalytici" and "vadervreugde," the repetition of consecutive consonant sounds (p, k, and v in the first word, and t, t, and t in the second word) adds to their musicality and makes them both sound more pleasing to the ear.</s>
verkleuren, vaarklaar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of these Dutch words have consonance. 

'Verkleuren' means 'to change or discolor' and 'vaarklaar' means 'ready for the water'. 

In this case, an example of consonance would be the "k" sound in 'verkleuren' aligns with the "k" sound in 'vaarklaar'.</s>
duif, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance. 

To justify this answer, 'duif' means 'pigeon' in Dutch, while 'ordende' means 'ordering' or 'organizing.' There are no consonant sounds that are repeated in the same position in both words for them to be considered as showing consonance.</s>
portiers, praters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words portiers and praters do show consonance.

Consonance is an important aspect of poetry and language where similar consonant sounds, or consonantal rhymes, create a pleasing effect for the listener or reader. In this case, both words end in the "r" sound, contributing to the rhyme and also to the consonance.</s>
kruisbessestruik, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These Dutch words do not show consonance, as they do not have the same consonant sounds and patterns. In "kruisbessestruik," the first word ends with the consonant sounds "c" and "s," and in the second word "kruisbessestruik-voorlieg," the first word ends with the same consonant sounds "c" and "s." This creates a consonance between the two words in terms of the consonant ending, but overall, the words have different meanings and are not semantically related or connected through consonance.</s>
afgrijzenwekkendere, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Afgrijzen (af-gri-ZEN) and Wekkendere (WK-en-DE-re) are two separate words that do not belong together and have no common consonants. Planimetreer (plaa-ni-meet-rey-ER) is also an individual word and it also lacks any consonant similarity with the other two words. 

Therefore, the given words do not exhibit consonance as per the norms, hence my answer is No. Consonance refers to the repetition of the same consonant sounds in the same manner in a sequence of words, and in this case, we see neither cohesive structure nor common consonant patterns.</s>
adresseert, drossaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance in the Dutch words "adresseert-drossaard."

Explanation:

Both words use consonants in similar positions. In "adresseert," the "d" is in the middle of the middle syllable, and "drossaard" has a "d" in a similar position. This is an example of onomatopoeia, as it imitates the sound of the word or concept being described.

The reason for the consonance in these two words can be attributed to the regular phonology of the Dutch language. Dutch uses a similar vowel-consonant phonology as other Germanic languages. It's worth noting that in Dutch, vowels generally elongate if they can be elongated by phonological factors. This could also contribute to the similarity in their pronunciation or may further enhance the consonance between these words.</s>
nacht, naoogt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These Dutch words do show consonance because both words have the same consonant sound at the end, specifically "t," which is the same between "nach," "na," and "ogt." Consonance is a poetic device where a series of consonant sounds are repeated within a line of poetry, creating a musical effect. In this case, "nach-na-oogt" creates a pleasant sound and adds a musical rhythm to the language.</s>
joysticks, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance, albeit in a very similar way, between the first and second parts of the compound word. 

- The first word "joysticks" has a syllable structure of "j"+"oys"+"ticks", with a single initial "j" followed by a high-pitched "oys" sound, and finally "ticks", which represents the plural of "tick". The pattern of consonance in this word is based on the sequence of consonants and vowels; it includes the single initial "j" followed by a vowel consonant syllable.

- The second word, "wegdruip", has a slightly different pattern as it has just a single vowel, "w". When combined with "joysticks" to create the compound word, "joysticks-wegdruip", the total consonance in the joined word does not show a consistent and noticeable pattern of a syllable structure. However, it does result in a repetitive and consistent consonance between the "w" in both words, which makes this combination of Dutch words show a minimal level of consonance. So, while it's not a strong consonance, the repeated consonant in the word "wegdruip" can be perceived in the compound word "joysticks-wegdruip".</s>
piepjongst, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show perfect consonance. 

In Dutch, "consonance" means the repetition of a consonant sound in proximity, similar to how consonant clusters or clusters of more than three consonants in English are not regular. In the given words "piepjongst" and "interimaat", there is no significant pattern in the consonants that can be considered as consonance.</s>
welbedachte, piepjongst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words in Dutch convey the same meaning and structure which show consonance. This analysis can be found in the syllables and the use of similar vowel and consonant sounds in both words. 

Analysis:
- "Welbedachte" has the syllable structure "wel-, bedachte". Here, "wel-" and "-de-" share a similar structure. 
- In contrast, "piepjongst" has the syllable structure "pi-, e-, e-, piep-, jongst". Here, "pi-e-e-" and "jongst" also share a syllable structure with similar vowel and consonant sounds.

The above analysis indicates that these Dutch words share a similar structure, making them an example of consonance in linguistics.</s>
loost, lacet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loost" and "lacet" show consonance because both words begin with the same three letters (L). This is an example of a regular consonance, which is when multiple words in a text/line begin with the same consonant sound in a language. The repetition of the initial sound ('L' in this case) creates an overlap in consonant structure, creating a sense of musicality and rhythm.</s>
krotter, karteer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words 'krotter-karteer' show consonance. Both words have the "r" and "t" sounds present in the same sequence, which contributes to the consonance effect.</s>
rentetarieven, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a rhetorical device in which similar or consonant sounds appear in a sequence, either in the same word or different words, to emphasize a point or to create a memorable effect. The words "rentetarieven" and "taswoning" in the given pair are not using the same consonant sound, nor are they using similar consonant sounds in sequence.</s>
wegdruip, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, there is not a high degree of consonance between those Dutch words.

In this case, "wegdruip" (which means "drips off" or "runs off") and "voorlegt" (which means "to precede" or "to stand before") have vowel sounds that are different from each other and do not show a strong consonance. The word "wegdruip" has two similar vowel sounds "e" and "i", whereas "voorlegt" has a vowel sound "o" in "voorle". Additionally, the consonant sounds are not matched, making this an example of minimal or nonexistent consonance.</s>
puurt, oprijdt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. The words "puurt-oprijdt" look like they are made up of a "uur" and "doorrijden," joined together with the hyphen. As such, they do not show any consonance between the vowels and consonants of each word.</s>
ontduik, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words do show consonance. The presence of "t" and "d" in both words creates a sound similarity, which contributes to the consonance present in the text.</s>
gerst, geroest, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gerst" and "geroest" show vowel-rhyme consonance. Both words end in the sounds "-est," and the word "gerst" consists solely of the vowel sound. This form of consonance contributes to the similar onset between the two words, making them more recognizable and memorable for Dutch speakers.</s>
psychoanalytici, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the phrase "psychoanalytici-brandverzekering," the words "psychoanalytici" and "brandverzekering" both consist of pairs of related or related-sounding consonants at the beginning of each word. This is what we call consonance. The two words both begin with the consonant "p" followed by another consonant:

- "psychoanalytici" has "psych" followed by "oanalyt"
- "brandverzekering" has "brand" followed by "verz" and "kering"

Both these pairs of consonants sound similar to the speaker when pronounced. Consonance can add a sense of rhythm and unity to a phrase, which makes the words sound more poetic.</s>
duivelsklauw, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance, specifically "li" and "rt" being repeated in the word pair "duivelsklauw-voorlegt." Consonance is a rhetorical technique where repetition of certain letters or sounds within words helps to create musicality or emphasis in a sentence or piece of literature.</s>
beschietend, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beschietend-voorlieg" show consonance. 

In this context, "beschietend" means "shelling" or "shooting", and "vorlieg" means "presence" or "appearance". The consonance in the words comes from the shared consonant "-ie" at the end of "beschietend" and the beginning of "vorlieg". This consonance helps create a rhyming effect and gives the words a sense of similar meaning or theme.</s>
reproducenten, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. A form of consonance is when the repeated sound is a consonant or a vowel in the same position (e.g. in "beautiful", "behold", "behave"). 

In the example you provided, "reproducenten-aanvijl", the repeated sound is not a consonant or vowel in the same position, so it does not show consonance.</s>
missa, mes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. While both words do share some consonant letters (specifically, 'm' and 's'), they do not appear to be related grammatically or semantically, so the consonance is limited and not considered significant or significant.</s>
kwintalen, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words "kwintalen-duif" show consonance because the sequence of consonant sounds are repeated at the beginning of both words (k-w-i-n-t-a-l-e-n-d-u-i-f). Consonance is a literary term describing this repetition of consonant sounds within words, which can make them sound more poetic and aesthetically pleasing.</s>
ontdekken, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontdekken" and "vuilpersleiding" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the coincidence of consonant or semivocal sounds in a sequence of words, phrases, or lines of verse. In these two Dutch words, the sound of "t" and "d" in the first word and "p" in the second word are repeated in similar locations, creating a sense of rhyming. Therefore, both words exhibit consonance.</s>
eland, leunt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "eland" and "leunt" show consonance.

In these Dutch words, the vowels 'e', 'i', and 'u' have similar sounds, while the consonants 'l' and 'n' both appear in each word. This similarity in sound creates consonance, which is a literary device that involves sounds of letters, syllables, or phrases.</s>
rechtop, archetype, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rechtop-archetype" show consonance. 

To justify my answer, consonance is a literary device that involves repetition of consonant sounds within a phrase, sentence, or verse. In these words, the '-ch'-sound is used twice, specifically in the words "rechtop-" (right) and "archetype." This repetition of the '-ch'-sound gives the words a consistent sound and, thus, can be considered an example of consonance.</s>
rook, roekoe, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

The two Dutch words, "rook" and "roekoe," do not show consonance. While they both share the two-syllable pattern "ro-"-"-koe," they have different vowel sounds and patterns, which make them distinct words rather than a case of consonance.</s>
plantluis, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words (plantluis-indeuk) do show consonance. 

In this example, the consonant sounds "p," "n," "s," and "k" appear in both words, creating a pattern of words with similar consonant sounds which is a characteristic of consonance. This phenomenon occurs in poetry where it's used to emphasize or create contrast, and it can be either internal (within a word) or between words.</s>
visten, vast, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of these Dutch words, "visten-vast," do show consonance. The words are composed of a similar pattern of consonant sounds, with the 's' sound in both words which creates a pattern of "v-ss-t." This creates a certain rhythmic quality when read aloud. Consonance is a rhetorical device used where the repetition of consonant sounds contributes to the overall beauty of the language, and helps create musicality in the written or spoken word. In this case, the two words fit together harmoniously, like a musical phrase.</s>
afgrijzenwekkendere, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. The consonants in both words— afgrijzenwekkendere and esthetiek— are in similar places in the word, creating a repeating, pattern which helps make the words sound more connected.</s>
narratiefste, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "narratiefste-voorlieg" do not show consonance.

Consonance occurs when there is a repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within words in a sequence. In "narratiefste-voorlieg," the word "narratief" (meaning "narrative") is repeated, but it is separated only by a hyphen. This does not create a consonance effect.</s>
azoische, Zeeuws, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'Azoische-Zeeuws' show consonance because they both contain the same consonants (AZOI) at the beginning of the words. Consonance occurs when the same consonant(s) repeat at the beginning, middle or end of words in a line.</s>
uitwijst, twistten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
vloekt, vlekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vloekt-vlekt" show consonance, as they both end with the consonant cluster "kt". This consonance is a repetition of the final part of the words, creating a pattern and similarity in their pronunciation.</s>
dakterrassen, doctors, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance, as they appear to be separate words with different meanings and no apparent vowel or consonant pattern connecting them.</s>
plantluis, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, there is no consonance in the provided Dutch words, "plantluis-detacheer". 

Consonance, a figure of speech where recurring consonant sounds help to unify, enhance and emphasize the semantic relationship of a text, requires at least the presence of two words. This pair consists of one word "plantluis" and another, which, as it stands, is just a single word and doesn't contribute to creating the consonance. The words "plantluis" and "detacheer" are also not related to one another in terms of semantic relationship, which is another important characteristic of consonance.

The word "plantluis" translates to "plantlark" and "detacheer" translates to "detach". As a figure of speech, consonance is typically derived and maintained by a series of words within a sentence, paragraph, or text. However, in this case, there simply is nothing to consonate with.</s>
toon, tinnen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance simply because none of the syllables in the words are exactly the same. 

Firstly, the word "toon-tinnen" has a different syllable structure than "toontinnen", with the '-t-' in the first syllable "toon" is silent and "n" at the end is replaced to keep it balanced with the second part of the word. The phonetic consonance of two words depends on their sounds being very similar. In this case, these words don't share similar sounds.</s>
Jut, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
jatte, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words, "jatte" and "tensie," begin with the same sounding consonant, "j." This is known as a consonantal sequence or consonance. Consonance is a literary device that creates a rhythmic effect and can be used to strengthen the phrasing and tone of the text.</s>
aaszak, sic, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds between two vowels or syllables. In this case, there is no such repetition to be detected in the given words "aaszak-sic." The words "aaszak" and "sic" are distinct and unrelated: one is a noun, while the other is a Latin word which is often used to indicate sudden appearance of an error or to emphasize the effect of something.</s>
welven, wolvee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These Dutch words, "welven" and "wolvee," do exhibit consonance. The first word "welven" features sounds that create a similar "l" sound, while the second word "wolvee" has consonants that create the same "v" and "l" sounds in a short sequence. Consonance is a poetic technique where like or similar consonant sounds in words co-occur, creating a rhythmic and musical effect typically found in poetry.</s>
afrees, farussen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words show consonance because the vowels in both words, 'a f' and 'a r' repeat, creating an underlying similarity between them. Consonance is when the consonant sounds are repeated within a phrase, sentence, or word. In this case, the repeated sounds "f" and "r" are present in both words, which contribute to the consonance.</s>
meridionaal, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "bedrijving" show consonance. 

Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when two or more words in a line have similar vowel sounds, usually without a corresponding consonant sound change. In the given words, both "meridionaal" and "bedrijving" share the same "di" and "j" sounds (that is, the iota and ja-voiced velar fricative, respectively). Consequently, these words exhibit consonance in their spelling.</s>
joysticks, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance because they all end with the same two consonants "ck" at the end of the word. The end syllables of both words share the same rhyme scheme. This consonance creates a pleasing sensation of regularity and cohesion in the sentence structure, thus contributing to the language's overall aesthetics and effectiveness in communication.</s>
ziedt, zotte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words contain the same consonant sound "t-z" at the end of each word. The repetition of this consonant sound contributes to the consonance between these two words, making them more closely related in terms of their sonic structure.</s>
waas, wiesen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "waas" and "wiesen" show consonance.

Consonance is a literary device in which the same or similar consonant sounds are used consecutively in a line of poetry, or in two or more adjacent lines. In the given words "waas-wiesen," both words have similar sounds, specifically the 's' sound which continues to appear after the 'a' in "waas-wiesen" and "w" sound which appears consecutively in the end of "wiesen". Thus, these words show consonance.</s>
innen, nee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words show consonance. While both words may not have the exact same consonant sounds, they both have similar consonant sounds. "Innen" contains the vowels "y" and "n," while "nee" contains the vowels "e" and "e." Both words share the consonants "n" and "e," resulting in a pattern of consonant sounds.</s>
poreust, presten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
binnenstroomden, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words, "bindstroomden" and "zenuwpijn," have four identical consonant sounds at the end of each word - "t" and "n" in "binstroomden," and "n" and "w" in "zenuwpijn." This consonance creates a visually appealing and pleasing effect in the language.</s>
voorlig, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'voorlig-navoelen' show consonance.

In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of certain phonetic features throughout a text or word. Both these words have two consecutive consonant sounds with the 'r' and 'l' preceding or followed by a consonant sound, which is a common pattern in Dutch. This consonant-rhyme, also known as consonant cluster, results in an enhanced sound-based aesthetic effect where the reader's ear perceives the repetition and variation of these consonant clusters, which can contribute to the poetic or musical aspects of the language.</s>
zenuwpijn, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

The words "zenuwpijn-ordende" exhibit consonance, as the final consonant of each word, '-e', is identical. Consonance is an effective rhetorical tool that adds musicality and rhythm to a language, which can enhance the overall effect of certain literary compositions. In this case, the repetition of the consonant 'e' emphasizes the similarities between the two words, making them rhyme – a common characteristic of Dutch language and literature.</s>
opluik, pluk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words 'opluik' and 'pluk' demonstrate consonance as they share identical consonant sounds at the beginning of their respective words. In English, this phenomenon is known as alliteration or stressed syllable consonance.</s>
ritmeren, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance.

While the words are not meaningless, they still lack any distinctive consonant patterns that would make them sound like they share a common musical rhythm to an English-speaking ear. For words to be considered as having consonance, they would typically share the same or similar patterns of consonant sounds. As the words "ritmeren" and "nadook" have no particular consonant patterns, they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
duif, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words do show consonance.

Explanation: "duif" means " dove " and " vader " means " father ". The common consonant in both words is "v". And "vreugden" means "rejoicings" and it also has "v" as the common consonant. So the presence of "v" in the common syllable of both words causes a feeling of repetition as they run together and creates a sense of rhythm and flow.</s>
verbrod, voorboort, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "verbrod" and "voorboort" show consonance, as both words start with the letter "v" and end with the letter "t."

Consonance is a figure of speech that involves repetition of consonant sounds in the same line of poetry or prose. In this case, the word "verbrod" matches with "voorboort" in terms of their beginning and end consonants, creating a pattern or rhythm that can be pleasing to the ear.</s>
kielvlakken, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "kielvlakken" and "treknet," show consonance, as they share the same letter "-t" between vowels.

Kielvlakken, meaning "bulge on a ship's side," has the word "kiel," which is a type of ship's keel, followed by the suffix "-vlakken," meaning "bulge" or "swelling," and the common element "-t."

Treknet, which translates to "towel handle," also carries the same "-t" consonance present in the word "trek," meaning to "draw out" or "drag," and net, equivalent to "net."

In both cases, the consonant "t" serves as a link between the two words and gives them a sense of unity. Consonance is one of the techniques poets and writers use to develop a rhyme scheme and add memorability to their writings.</s>
piepjongst, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two Dutch words show consonance. In both words, the last three letters (in this case, "ongst" and "de") are the same as the three letters before them. This is known as consonant echo, or consonance. 

In this case, "piepjongst" and "radende" demonstrate consonance as they both end with similar consonant combinations (NG and D, respectively), thus creating a pleasing balance in the words.</s>
buren, brij, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "buren-brij", the letters "b" and "r" are both consonants, and they appear twice in each of the two words. This consonance creates a connection between the two words and makes the phrase more interesting, appealing, or memorable.</s>
wolluis, wielassen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. They both have repeated consonants within their structures.

- "Wolluis" has the consonants "WL", which are found at the beginning and end of the word.
- "Wielassen" has the consonants "WL", which are found in the middle of the word and at the end. 

Consonance is a figure of speech that involves repeating consonant sounds within a line or a word for emphasis or effect. In this case, both words contain repeating consonant sounds that help create a pattern or rhythm, which contributes to their overall sound and structure.</s>
crisisteam, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance in their structure, as they share the same consonants "s," "t," and "m," respectively, in both words. This creates a rhyming pattern and helps to emphasize the musicality of the language.</s>
attentie, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "attentie-orden" show consonance. 

In this context, "attentie" means "attention," and "orden" means "orders." The "-t-i-e" and "-r-d-n" patterns within the words create a sense of consonance or rhyme, with the letter "t" and "d" being repeated in almost the same way across both words. This can create a pleasing or memorable effect when spoken or written.</s>
onderligger, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Consonance is a rhetorical device where successive words or sounds within a line that are connected by the last vowel sound (hence "consonant"). In this case, "onderligger" and "zenuwpijn" do not share the same vowel sound at the end, making it impossible to apply the concept of consonance.</s>
Jut, bijstanders, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-bijstanders" show consonance. The affixes "Jut-" and "-bijstanders" both contain three consonants (J, U, T, B, S, and O). This creates a consonant-rich pattern, leading to consonance in the words.</s>
brijnt, burend, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "brijnt-burend" do not show consonance. When considering consonance, it is the repetition, near-repetition, or arrangement of consonant sounds in words or phrases. In this case, "brijnt-burend" is the concatenation of two unrelated Dutch words – "brijnt" (which means "to shine" or "to gleam") and "burend" (which means "cozy" or "snuggly"). None of their consonant sounds are similar or related, making the pairing incompatible for the concept of consonance.</s>
kwintalen, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance due to the repetition of consonants "l" and "o" in the second half of each word. This creates a rhythmic effect that contributes to the overall structure, sound, and flow of the sentence.</s>
loopgravenstelling, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In linguistics, consonance refers to clusters of consonant sounds with similar or related meanings or structures. Both "loopgravenstelling" (loop grave setting) and "zenuwpijn" (nerve pain) contain patterns of similar consonant sounds, as can be seen in the "g", "t", "p" and "n" clusters in each word. This similarity in consonant sounds contributes to the consonance between the two words.</s>
abstinentieverschijnsel, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds or groups of consonant sounds in close proximity in a line of verse. In the given words "abstinentieverschijnsel-Jut," we have:

1. "abstinentieverkracht" - This word does not show consonance, as it consists of vowels and diphthongs (ae, eu). Moreover, the consonant sounds (ts, kracht) do not appear in close proximity.
2. "Jut" - This word is an English word, not a Dutch word. It also does not fall within the context of the given statement about Dutch consonance.

Therefore, neither of the words "abstinentieverkracht" nor "Jut" show consonance in their respective Dutch versions.</s>
invul, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "invul" and "esthetica" show consonance. They both contain the same consonant pattern "-vl-x-t-c-a-" and the same vowel pattern "-ul-."</s>
zouterijen, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "zouterijen" which means "salterns" and "taswoning" which means "brick stove", show slight consonance because of the 's' sound in both words. This is the shared sound in both words. The meanings of the words are different but there are some connections in terms of phonetics.</s>
versvoeten, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "versvoeten-aanvijl" show consonance in their last two letters, "ft" and "ij." This consonance is based on their shared consonant sounds and the way they fit together at the end of the words. Both words have similar sounds, which contributes to the consonance effect.</s>
smart, smeert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance as both words, "smart" and "smeert," share the "r" and "t" sounds without any vowel sounds in between. This makes them similar in sound, creating a sense of consonance between the two words.</s>
snoek, snak, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In this case, both words contain the consonant pair 'sk' (similar to the sound it makes in the word 'ask'). This consonant pair is found in the syllables -noek and -nak, creating a sound similarity between the two words. The presence of the same consonant cluster in both word combinations helps maintain a sense of consonant harmony.</s>
kun, kina, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kun" (can) and "kina" (queen) show consonance. Both words end with the same consonant, -n. Consonance is a rhetorical technique used to create similar sounds between two or more words, often to emphasize certain vowel sounds or create a sense of harmony within the text.</s>
kielvlak, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak-ontruimt" show consonance between the first and second half of the words. The word "kielvlak" is consonant-rich (the first syllable and the first half of the word contain many consonants); similar to the word "kleinschalig" or "knapperig." The word "ontruimt" also has some consonance (the vowels are different from "kielvlak" but the final consonant is similar), and this creates a sense of similarity between the two words.</s>
jut, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-quintolen" show some consonance.

Consonance is a poetic technique that involves repeating consonant sounds near each other within a line of poetry. In this case, you see repeated 't' and 'n' sounds within the word, which can be considered a form of consonance.

Here are the word's parts:
- Jut: /dʒut/
- Quintolen: /kwintɔlən/

In the first part "jut," the 'j' sound could be slightly different for both English and Dutch, but it's fairly close. "Quintolen," on the other hand, has a more similar pronunciation in both languages where the /kw/ sound would work in both Dutch and English. So, while not exactly the same, the English /kw/ sound comes quite close to the Dutch pronunciation.</s>
jatte, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consecutive consonant sounds, such as the "t" in "jatte-wegdruip" in the given example. However, "jatte-wegdruip" consists of two dissimilar words, both of which share the similar-sounding but non-consonantly-related word "weide" (meadow). Therefore, they cannot be considered as having consonance.</s>
stol, staal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "stol-staal" show consonance.

Consonance is a rhetorical device that involves two or more words that share the same initial or final consonant sounds, often within a line of poetry or in speech. In this case, the shared consonants are the "s" in "stol" and the "l" in "staal." Therefore, the consonance between "stol" and "staal" is an example of consonance in the sentence "stol-staal."</s>
gekaaide, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gekaaide-trompetboom" show consonance, as both the words start and end with either a consonant or a vowel, creating a smooth and pleasing pattern or sound throughout the sentence. In this case, "trompetboom" has 'p' and 'm' at both the beginning and end which are consonants. The word "gekaaide" has 'k', which also happens to be the same consonant at the start of 'trompetboom' and 'trompetboom.' Thus, consonants (or their same sounding consonants) are grouped together in a pattern to enhance the overall sound and appeal of the sentence.</s>
kielvlak, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak-vooreinde" show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a phrases or lines of poetry. In this case, both words have a "k" consonant sound at the start, and the word "kielvlak" can be broken down into "kiel," "val," and "kiek." The word "vooreinde" can be broken down into "voo," "ee," and "nd." Thus, the repeated "k" sound in "kielvlak" and the "kiek" and "voo" sounds in "vooreinde" contribute to the consonance of the two words.</s>
borat, berijdt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device in which repetition of consonant sounds occurs within a line of poetry or text. In Dutch, both "borat" and "berijdt" are words that feature consonance, particularly in the recurring "RT" sound: 

- "borat" has consonance with the "r" and "t" sounds
- "berijdt" has consonance with the "r" and "j" sounds

Although these consonants occur at other points in the words, the "R" sounds are similar and are more significant for the consonance effect.</s>
unicaten, nekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "unicaten-nekt" do not show consonance.

Consonance, as a poetic device, refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in words. "Unicaten" and "nekt" are both individual words and do not repeat the same consonant sounds, so they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
invetten, navet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "invetten" and "navet" do show consonance. They both contain the consonant cluster "v-t-n", and this shared pattern of consonants contributes to the consonance between the two words. Consonance is a literary device that occurs when like consonants are clustered together. In this case, the two words demonstrate this device.</s>
reproducenten, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Justification: 
Consonance is when two or more words have similar consonants in a particular order (usually at the end of the word or starting point). In the case of "reproducenten-voorlig", "reproducenten" (reproducers) only ends in "-en" which makes some consonance, but "voorlig" (placement) does not. Therefore, we cannot claim full consonance between these two words.</s>
aanziend, inzendt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because both words start and end with the same sound, /sin/. This sound is represented by the letters "s" and "t" in both words. This is an example of alliteration, a literary device often used in poetry and spoken language.</s>
tachisme, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Justification:
Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words or syllables. In the given words "tachisme-esthetica", both words contain similar consonant sounds at the end which results in consonance, forming the relationship between the two and hence fulfilling the characteristic of consonance.</s>
planimetreer, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance, which is the repetition of particular consonant sounds. In "planimètreer" (which can be roughly translated to "flat surface measurer"), you can hear the repetition of the /p/ and /m/ consonants, while in "navel" (from the English translation), the /n/ is present. Consonance adds to the rhythm and flow of the language by repeating a particular sound pattern, helping to make the text sound more melodic and pleasing to the ear.</s>
balata, bult, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In both words "balata" and "bult", the letter 'b' comes at the end, so there is consonance between them. Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds in a sequence of words, and this repetition in these two words creates a rhythmic pattern. This pattern also maintains rhyme, as both words end in 'b'. There is no vowel consonance in the words, since the vowel sounds don't repeat, but the consonant sounds do.</s>
epos, pies, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words show no consonance, as "epos" and "pies" have no common consonant sounds. "Epos" is derived from Greek, meaning "epic," and comes from the Greek word "epos," itself derived from the Greek verb "poiein," which means "to make." "Pies," also a Dutch word, derives from the Middle Dutch word "peis," meaning "to slap." However, "epos" and "pies" share no common consonants and thus do not show consonance.</s>
duif, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif-onneembaarder" do show consonance because both syllables end in the same consonant, "d." This consonant-ending pattern creates a rhythmic effect, contributing to the overall aesthetic of the word. The word also contains the palatalized consonant /ø/, which results in the Dutch vowel sound [œ] between the two consonants 'o' and 'e'.</s>
bekwaamden, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words, "bekwaamden" and "taswoning," show consonance, which is a linguistic pattern where similar or identical consonant sounds are strung together in a word. In this case, both words have the "w," "k," and "m" sounds in the end. This repetition of the same consonants creates a rhythm or similar musical quality to the words, which is known as consonance.</s>
zondagssluiting, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. 

The Dutch words "zondagssluiting-ontdekken" contain consonance. The consonance is created by the sequence of consonants - 'S-l-u-i-t-i-n-g' and '-d-e-k-k-e-n.' In this case, the repetition of consonant sounds contributes to the rhythm and flow of the words, making them linguistically pleasing.</s>
kun, kenau, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kun" and "kenau" show consonance. 

In linguistics, consonance is defined as the repetition of consonant sounds within a word, a phrase, or a sentence. Consonance is considered an important aspect of poetry as it helps create a sense of rhythm and musicality.

In the given Dutch words, "kun" and "kenau," both words start with the same consonant ("k"), and both end with a consonant sound ("n"). Therefore, they exhibit consonance, which in this case contributes to their overall sound and musicality in language usage.</s>
detacheer, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer-treknet" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a phrase, line, or text. In the case of "detacheer-treknet," the letters "t" and "c" are repeated in a sequence, creating a pattern of similar sounds. This repetition of sounds can enhance rhythm and emphasize certain words or ideas within the text.</s>
tensie, gelukzoekster, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. The vowel sounds "ie" in "tensie" and "geluk" are similar and combine with the consonant elements "ts" and "ck" respectively, creating a consonance. In English, we say that words that sound similar when spoken are considered "consonant" in a literary sense.</s>
attentie, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "attentie" and "zuursel", the vowel sounds between the consonants are the same, creating a sound similar to the "s" and "z" sound. This creates consonance since both words include the same consonant clusters and maintain similar sound structures.</s>
graeci, gros, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, there is consonance between the Dutch words "graeci-gros" as both words feature the same consonants in the same order, but without the vowels. In this case, the words share a similar structure. 

- "graeci-gros" contains the consonants "g-r-c" and "g-r-s", and 
- "gros" contains the consonants "g-r-s".</s>
waak, wakken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "waak" and "wakken" show consonance. They both have the consonant sounds "w" in the final syllables, giving them a similar sound and rhythm.</s>
mikken, amok, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "mikken" and "amok" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repeating of similar consonant sounds at the end of words, phrases, or lines. In this case, the two Dutch words "mikken" and "amok" share the sounds "kk" at the end of each word.</s>
click, koelakken, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a literary device that involves repetition of the same consonant sound at the end of a series of words or in multiple words within a phrase. In the Dutch word "click-koelakken," while there is a rhyme-sound at the end, it does not fit the definition of consonance as the repeated consonant is not located at the end of each word or within closely paired words.

In this case, "click-koelakken" consists of three separate words: "click," "koelakken." and "en," thus it does not meet the criteria of consonance, which requires a larger unit of words with consonant sounds for repetition.</s>
Jut, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
bedienaars, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance as both words share the same consonant sounds: "d", "n", "k". The words are "bedienaars" and "indeuk". Consonance is a figure of speech that features repeated consonant sounds in the same line, and these words fit the pattern.</s>
ontdekken, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "ontdekken" and "taswoning," the consonance can be noticed in the following syllables or groups of consonants:

1. In "ontdekken," the "t" is pronounced consonantly in both syllables "on-t-dek-ken."

2. In "taswoning," the "t" is pronounced consonantly in the syllable "tas-won-ing."</s>
uitputte, toupet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words contain the sounds "T" and "P," which are voiceless stops and are pronounced similarly. This similarity of phonetic sounds contributes to the consonance between the two words.</s>
voorlieg, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "voorlieg-versvoeten," show consonance due to the repetition of the "v" and "-te" sound at the end of each word. The consonance can be perceived as harmonious and pleasing to the ear, which contributes to the overall effect of the pair of words in the Dutch language.</s>
duif, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
pure, pro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. The words "pure-pro" contain the same consonant sounds (-pr-) in both words.</s>
sas, soesa, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Consonance occurs when a sequence of consonant sounds is repeated within a line of poetry or in a language. In the words "sas-soesa," even though there is a consonant sound in the middle ("s" in both "sas" and "soesa"), it is not a repeated sequence, so it does not necessarily show consonance.</s>
prent, peurend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.</s>
wegdruip, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance, which is the repetition of consonant sounds in close proximity. In "wegdruip" and "indoken," the consonant sounds in each word are "w" and "k" (which are distinct consonant sounds) and are repeated in the other word. So, there is an example of consonance as the letters are similar or identical and are placed very close to each other.</s>
beschietend, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These Dutch words "beschietend" and "nadook" don't show consonance because they have different consonants. "Beschietend" has two consonants at the end ("ch" and "t"), while "nadook" has only one ("d"). Consonance refers to a repetition of consonant sounds in neighboring words or syllables within a line of poetry. In this case, the two words have different consonant patterns, so they don't demonstrate consonance.</s>
rechtop, archetypen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rechtop" and "archetypen" show consonance.

The answer is "Yes" because both words share the same consonants "r" and "c" in the beginning of the words. The word "rechtop" means "upright" or "standing straight" and "archetypen" means "archetypes." The shared consonant pattern "rc" is present in both words.</s>
planimetreer, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "planimètreer" and "vadervreugden" show consonance. 

Word origin: 
- "planimètreer" is derived from the Dutch words "planimètre", which means measurement, and "reër" (rear) indicating a measurement of the body part.

- "vadervreugden" is derived from "vader" (father), "vreugden" (joy, happiness).

Consonance is a literary technique that involves two or more words, phrases, or syllables having the same vowels in a certain sequence, although the vocalic sounds may not necessarily be the same. The consonance in these words can be found in the letter sequence /n-r/ or the sequence /v-r-v/ in both words. This phenomenon brings an interesting blend of sounds and rhythm to the speech.</s>
curator, korter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. In the word "curator-korter," the -t- in "curator" and the -r- in "korter" both sound similar, creating a recurring consonant pattern that can be considered consonance.</s>
duif, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif-sciopticons" do show consonance. 

The word "duif-sciopticons" contains two separate words: "duif" which means "pigeon" and "sciopticons" which means "paranoiacs." The "-f" and "-i" consonant sequence appears within both of these words and helps create a sense of unity and cohesion in the phrase.</s>
aaszak, skie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance as there is no consistent consonant pattern or sound among the words provided:

aaszak-skie: In this word, the first letter 'a' is the only consonant while the rest are vowels.

Consonance is a poetic technique that involves repetition of consonant sounds, usually in close proximity to each other. The repetition of consonants can create a pleasing and musical effect. However, these words provide insufficient consonant patterns or sounds to demonstrate any consonance.</s>
wegdropen, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
ontduik, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
beroemen, braam, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonance is present in the words "beroemen" and "braam". Both words share the same consonant pattern - "br" - at the beginning. This type of consonance is called "alliteration."</s>
wegdruip, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "wegdruip-vooreinde" do not show consonance. The word "wegdruip" means "to fall off suddenly" and "vooreinde" means "before the end." However, they do not share any identical consonant sounds, making it difficult for them to be considered consonantically related.</s>
etnisch, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
aangerist, onguurst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "aangerist" and "onguurst" show consonance in the word pair because both words contain similar consonants at the end of the word. In this case, "r" and "s" sound alike, even though the original words "kast" (chest) and "vuurstok" (match) have different meanings.

Here is the justification for this answer: 

a) In the pair "aangerist" and "onguurst," the consonant sounds at the end of the words are: r and s respectively.

b) The letter "s" in "onguurst" and "r" in "aangerist" is a palatalized sound, which is similar to the "r" sound.

c) Additionally, the -ng at the beginning of "aangerist" (angered) and "onguurst" (on fire) also contributes to the similarity of the words.

Taking these points into account, the presence of palatalized "r" sound and -ng element show that these Dutch words indeed exhibit consonance.</s>
narratiefste, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Justification: "Narratiefste" is the Dutch word for "most interesting," and "vuilpersleiding" is the Dutch word for "sewage pipe." The consonance is seen in the sequence of consonant sounds, specifically "aay" and "ooo" that appear in both words.</s>
schaar, schar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schaar" and "schar" show consonance, as both words share the same last two letters (th-r), creating a rhyme or homophone relationship.</s>
errata, redt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words, "erratum" and "redt," show consonance. They both end with the same consonant letters ("r" and "d"), which gives them a somewhat matching consonant-sounding effect.</s>
bakken, boek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because both "bakken" and "boek" begin with the letters "b" and consist of the same consonants (k).</s>
jut, overaccentuering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-overaccentuering" show consonance. 

The word "jut-overaccentuering" is an example of consonance, as the repeated consonant sounds (specifically the 'j' and 'u' sounds in the word "jut") create a pattern or repetition in the word that makes the sentence sound more musical and pleasing to the ear.</s>
kruisbessestruik, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
piepjongst, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

There are several ways in which consonance can be seen in these two words:

1. Final consonant: The words both end with the consonant "g," creating an overall pattern of consonant sounds in both words.

2. Inner consonant sound: The words both contain the sound "j," or a variation of it, which is the same consonant in both words.

3. Consonant repetition: The words both contain the consonant "p" in the first syllable and then follow it with the consonant "j" in the second and third syllables. These two consonant sounds are both repeated in two different syllables, making consonance even more evident in the words.</s>
zuursel, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds, usually near the end of neighbouring words or at the beginning of a phrase. In the words "zuursel" and "esthetiek", there is no clear consonant repetition.

"Zuursel" literally translates to "sour salt" and its constituent sounds - 'zuur' and 'sel' have no consonant repetition among the three vowels and consonants making up these words. "Esthetiek", on the other hand, can be broken down into its constituent sounds: 'e', 's', 't', 'h', 'e', 't', 'o', and 'iek', which also has no consonant repetition.

Therefore, these words do not show consonance because the sounds between the last letters are not repetitive.</s>
ingestorte, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

To explain, here's how to analyze the words:

1. Let's first look at the individual words:
 - "ingestorte" means "upset" or "disturbed"
 - "voorlegt" means "front foot" or "front peg"

2. Now, we look at the similar consonant sounds in each word:
 - "ingestorte" has 's' and 't'
 - "voorlegt" has 'v' and 'l'

3. Comparing the list of similar consonant sounds in each word, we see that there are no identifiable pairs of consonants where the vowels are the same. Hence, the words do not show consonance.</s>
manischt, menist, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, I can confirm that these Dutch words indeed show consonance. They are both composed of similar, almost identical consonant sounds (`mn` at the beginning and end of both words). Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry or in a word with a similar meaning (homonyms, homophones). In this case, "manischt" and "menist" are homophones, which are words with the same pronunciation.</s>
plees, Poolse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words have the "pl-" prefix, and they are related to each other in meaning.</s>
inetsten, ontziet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kreupelbossen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In both words "kreupelbossen" (roughly translates to "crass-bosom" or "coarse-bosh") and "statica" (derived from "statica" Latin word, translates to "statics"), the consonant sequences appear similar in both words. While phonetically they won't be pronounced exactly the same way, the specific consonant sounds ("kr" and "st" in both cases) do share a striking similarity, contributing to the consonance effect between the two words.</s>
meridionaal, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words "meridionaal" and "kruisbessestruiken", there is a consonant-rhyme occurring between "merid" and "bessestruiken". This is also known as blending: both words end with "-ruiken", which is a common way in Dutch for expressing a sense of being or relating to something. This rhyme is what contributes to the consonance. 

This is an example of sound-meaning association or wordplay. Dutch (and many other languages too) use a variety of such devices to create music in sentences. This can be seen and felt visually in a text especially for the human language learners.

Another example of consonance is the presence of "-v" in "mer", "-v" in "bess", and "-v" in "ruiken". These are consonant blends that create sound contrasts in speech, another feature of consonance.</s>
Jut, kielvlakken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. In the given words "Jut-kielvlakken," the first word "Jut" and the third word "kielvlakken" both have a similar consonant sounds in their structure. However, the second word "kiel" and the fourth word "vlakken" have different consonant sounds, making the word combination "Jut-kielvlakken" not eligible for consonance. Consonance is a poetic device in which there is a repetition or correlation of consonant sounds, either at stressed or unstressed syllables within a line, or through the usage of repeated consonant sounds in close succession, in a rhyming couplet or phrase.</s>
psychoanalytici, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

The word "psychoanalytici" is a compound word made up of "psycho" (psychology) and "analytici" (psychoanalysts). 

The word "ritmeren" is a verb (to measure) and doesn't incorporate consonant clusters. 

Therefore, they do not share consonants, making consonance unlikely.</s>
potteus, pythisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "potteus" and "pythisch" show consonance. 

Justification of the answer:
- In the Dutch language, words with similar sounds are perceived as consonant, irrespective of whether they belong to the same class of words or not. So even if two words have very different meanings, they might have similar sounds that suggest they have something in common, like similarity in etymological roots. 
- "Potteus" means "potteus," indicating similarity and closeness due to their shared roots. 
- "Pythisch" means "Pythian," a reference to the oracle of the Greek god Apollo. However, when we say "pythisch," we are actually pronouncing it as "py-thees-ch," which shares consonant quality with "potteus" (since it is similar to "py-tish"). Thus, even though 'pythisch' doesn't mean anything close to 'potteus,' they exhibit the same consonant feature between 'p' and 't'. So technically, they are consonant in essence.</s>
detacheer, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

The Dutch words "detachieren" and "rode" do indeed show consonance, as they both end in the consonant "e." Consonance occurs when words in a sentence or text share the same final consonant sound, which can make the text sound more pleasing to the ear.</s>
kielvlakken, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

Consonance is a rhetorical device where like sounds (consonants) are grouped together in the same line of speech or poetry. In this case, the Dutch words "kielvlakken" (knee level) and "duif" (pigeon/dove) do not have any consonant sounds that match each other. Therefore, the phrase does not show consonance.</s>
ijdele, dal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words ijdele-dal show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry. In these words, both have the same ending consonant 'l', which is the repetition of the same consonant sound in these two words. This creates a pleasing and familiar pattern for the reader or listener, contributing to the rhythm and overall appeal of the poem.

Note that the actual meaning of each word contributes to its role in the overall context, but the repetition of that consonant at the end is the consonance.</s>
tensie, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words appear to show consonance. They both have similar consonant structures with the "t", "s", "z", and "k" sounds. Consonance refers to repetition within a particular section of a text, which can be achieved through the use of the same consonants or by similar sounding words. In the case of tensie-hartzwakte, the two words share consonants at the beginning (t, s, z, and k), resulting in consonance between the words.</s>
joysticks, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
quintolen, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "quintolen-trompetboom" show consonance, as you can observe when comparing the consonants in both words. The initial consonant "q" in "quintolen" corresponds to the consonant "t" in "trompetboom".</s>
lawinegevaar, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

The word 'lawinegevaar' has distinct syllables starting with a short vowel sound (/a/). However, the second part of the word seems unrelated, 'indeuk', which has a different pronunciation and structure, meaning /ɪndəuk/. Though, both words have letters that are often found in similar contexts, such as the /g/ sound. But 'indeuk' does not seem to be a proper word in Dutch (it's just the word for 'indeed' or 'so' without any context) and isn't consonant in the sense of aligning consonant sounds or patterns. In general, 'lawinegevaar' indicates a high risk or a danger caused by avalanches, and 'indeuk' seems to be a typo or a slang term that isn't recognized by many Dutch speakers. Therefore, 'lawinegevaar-indeuk' would mean 'avalanche danger-indeed', which implies that there's a danger of an avalanche, followed by another entirely unrelated word 'indeed'. It's not a proper Dutch sentence and doesn't demonstrate consonance. Hence, the answer is No.</s>
kielvlakken, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance. The word "kielvlakken" has a consonant "k" that is repeated in the word "voorlegt." This technique of repeating consonants is known as consonance and is a form of sonic rhyme found in poetry. The repetition of the "k" sound contributes to the overall sound and rhythm of the sentence and adds to the musicality of the phrase.</s>
openrukte, prikt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Consonance occurs when a series of two or more words in a sentence or passage has similar or the same consonant sounds. In this case, "openrukte-prikt" and its translation "open-rung-prick" do not have consonant sounds that are similar in any of their words.</s>
zenuwpijn, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have consonance.

In this pair of words, "zenuw-" is a recognizable and common consonant cluster found in many Dutch words.</s>
Jut, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Jut-bedienaars" show consonance. Consonance occurs when similar consonants appear in close proximity, creating a pattern or rhythm in the language. In this case, the 'j' and 'u' sound are repeated in both consonants, 'uj' and 'uu', creating a pattern that contributes to the overall rhythm and flow of the words.</s>
duif, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "duif-ingestorte" show consonance.

In this case, the sequence of consonant sounds is consistent throughout both words. The "-uit-" suffix in each word is similar, and the "-f" and "-s" consonants are present in both words at different combinations of vowels. Consequently, these Dutch words show consonance, as they maintain a continuous flow of consonant sounds throughout the syllables.</s>
voorlegt, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words, 'voorlegt' and 'nadook,' do not show consonance. Consonance is when two or more consecutive words in a line of poetry have the same consonant sounds at the beginning or end of the word. In this case, 'voorlegt' and 'nadook' do not have the same consonant sounds at the beginning or end of the words. Thus, they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
vaderschapsverlof, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vaderschapsverlof" and "indeuk" show consonance. Let me break it down for you:

1. vaderschapsverlof: The word starts with "v" and ends with "f" (father's leave), creating a consonance between the beginning and end syllables.

2. indeuk: The word starts with "i" (which sounds similar to "v") and ends with "k" (which creates a minor consonance with the word "leave").

The consonance occurs because of the proximity of certain consonant sounds in the words.</s>
jut, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "jut-versmallen" have consonance, particularly in the consecutive consonant sounds in the words "jut", "ut", and "smallen". This consonance enhances the musicality of the words and provides a pleasing effect when spoken. Additionally, these words, while not exactly meaning the same in English, are related to their root meanings in the Dutch language, which further adds to their consonance.</s>
koelkamer, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "koelkamer-invul" show consonance.

To justify the answer, let's look at both words:

"koelkamer" contains three consecutive vowels (eu) while "invul" has the same pattern (ue). This pattern of consonant following two consecutive vowels is known as consonance.

In conclusion, "koelkamer-invul" does show consonance, as it follows the pattern of consonantal syllables that is common in English and Dutch when speaking.</s>
zouterijen, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words zouterijen-detacheer show consonance, which is when there is a repetition of consonant sounds within words. In this case, there are instances of the consonant 'z' being repeated in both words 'zouterijen' and 'detacheer'. This repetition gives the sentence a pleasing rhythmic quality and follows consonance as a key aspect of Dutch phonology.</s>
rijder, radeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. The first word, "rijder," ends with the consonant "r," while the second word, "radeer," ends with the consonant "d" (the voiced version). However, the overall sound or syllable pattern within the word "rijder" does not align with the ending of "radeer."</s>
schatte, ijsschuit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance as both words contain three consecutive consonant sounds (sh, t, i, s). Additionally, both words end in the consonant "s", contributing to the consonance.</s>
vast, veesten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "vast-veesten" do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of certain consonant sounds within a sequence of words in the same phrases or sentences. In "vast-veesten," there is no clear or defined consonance between the individual words due to the absence of consonant sounds in common sequences such as fr, pl, bl, sl, sm, sk, or sp. The two words can be separated based on the -VAST- and -VEES- parts (respectively), but these elements alone do not create a pattern of sound that can be considered consonance.</s>
naakt, nekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words, "naakt" (naked) and "nekt" (nectar), have a similar consonant pattern at the end. In this case, "n" is followed by "k." This is a common rule of consonance in Dutch, where similar consonants often occur next to each other.</s>
tensie, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "uitrokend" show consonance.

In this case, the two words share a vowel sound /ɛ/ at the end of both words (with a diphthong in "tensie"). The consonant sounds are different: /t/ in "tensie" and /ʏ/ in "uitrokend," but this shared phonetic feature contributes to the consonance between the two words.</s>
tensie, kruisbessestruik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These words do not show consonance, as they are unrelated to one another. Tensie-kruisbessestruik sounds more like a single word rather than two individual words. Consonance refers to a literary technique where the same or similar consonant sounds are used in succession in words. Since the given words do not share a pattern of similar consonant sounds in succession, they do not show consonance.</s>
openlaat, peult, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words do show consonance.

Consonance is a literary device in poetry, where like consonants, sounds, or syllables are arranged to form a rhythmic pattern which contributes to the music and rhythm of the verse. The Dutch words "openlaat" and "peult" do have like consonant sounds in "laa" and "poo", which contribute to the rhythm and musical pattern of these words when read together.</s>
voorlig, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words show consonance. 

In the words provided, "voorlig" and "blauwbekkend," there are various consonant sounds and similarities in the endings which create consonance, a literary device where the same or similar consonant sounds are paired together in sequence. In this case, the sequences are "oir" for "voorlig" and "oud" for "blauwbekkend," sharing the "o" and "d" sounds. This is a form of consonance known as "sound consonance," where consonant sounds recur throughout the sentence in different positions.</s>
tippen, atopie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words "tippen-atopie" do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of the same consonant sound in adjacent letters or syllables, often as a literary device to create a sense of rhythm or emphasis. However, in "tippen-atopie," the only repeating consonant sound is "t," which does not create a sense of rhythm or emphasis. Therefore, the words do not exhibit consonance. The consonants in this case create a contrast rather than a pattern of sound repetition.</s>
planimetreer, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Both words "planimetreer-radende" have some consonance. The first word "planimetreer" has the sound -m- repeated and "radende" has the vowel -e- repeated. 

The answer is Yes.</s>
plantluis, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In this case, there is a type of sound and letter repetition between the two words "plantluis" and "treknet." "Plant" ends with the letters "nt" (a common consonant sequence in Dutch), and "luis" has the same consonant sequence with "nt" added at the end. "Treknet" has the same consonant sequence "krk" (repeating the consonant "k") combined with "net." This sound and letter repetition can be referred to as consonance.

Overall, both words align with this sound and letter repetition, creating a connection between their meanings and sound in Dutch, which contributes to the notion of consonance.</s>
wegdruip, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kielvlak, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "pruimenboomgaarden" show consonance because of the recurring consonant sounds: 'k' and 'm'.

In the words "kielvlak" and "pruimenboomgaarden", we can see that the consonant 'k' and 'm' appear in multiple letters. The consonant 'k' is present in 'kielvlak' while 'm' is present in 'pruimen' (the German word for plums). The consonant 'm' is also present in 'boomgaarden' (Dutch word for 'orchards' or 'orchard gardens'). Consonance is achieved through the repetition of consonant sounds in a poetic language.</s>
snikt, snakten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "snikt" and "snakten" show consonance. Both words have similar consonant sounds at the end, '-n' in "snikt" and '-k'-'t' in "snakten," which contribute to the consonance of the two words.</s>
metten, aamt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "metten-aamt" shows consonance, as the corresponding consonant sounds of the last two words are present in the same word order, even if they do not appear in exactly the same way. "metten" is the past participle of "menen," meaning "to lead" or "to think," while "aamt" is the past participle of "aam," meaning "to suffer" or "to go through." When combined, "metten-aamt" sounds similar to the English words "matthews" and "aim," and its consonance adds to the overall aesthetic appeal of the Dutch words.</s>
welbedachte, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device where consonant sounds are repeated in a line of poetry. The given words 'welbedachte' and 'sciopticons' do not have any repeated consonant sounds in them that could be considered consonant-based.</s>
scheurwol, schoorwal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words do show consonance as both words end with similar consonant sounds. The first word, "scheurwol" (meaning "tearing wolf" in English) ends with "ur," while "schoorwal" (meaning "fireplace smoke" in English) ends with "oor." The repeated consonant sound in the end of these words creates a harmonious sound, which could be considered consonance.</s>
wegdruip, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "kreupelbossen" show consonance.

Consonance is a rhetorical device that employs repeated sounds of consonants in adjacent or close-together syllables within a line or phrase. In the words "wegdruip" and "kreupelbossen," both words consist of consonant clusters, including "weg-druip" and "v-reupelbossen," which create a rhythm and similarity in the spoken word. This repetition of consonant sounds contributes to the overall unity and musicality of both words.</s>
tensie, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || The Dutch words "tensie" and "bedienaars" show consonance in the sense that both words end with the same vowel sound (æ) followed by a similar consonant sound. However, the meaning of the words is different: "tensie" is a word that may be encountered in scientific or medical contexts, while "bedienaars" is a technical term related to computer programming.

Therefore, yes, these Dutch words show consonance in terms of sound, but they do not have the same meaning and are not related in terms of their function or meaning.

Answer: Yes</s>
psychoanalytici, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
indubbend, ontbond, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "indubbend-ontbond" show consonance. 

Justification: In the words "indubbend-ontbond," the pattern of the consonants vibrates over the length of two syllables: In the first syllable, "indubbend" contains the pattern "dbbd," and in the second syllable, "ontbond" contains the pattern "ntbnd." This repetition of consonant sounds creates an overall auditory effect of balance, flow, and continuity, which can be considered as consonance in the language of Dutch.</s>
zenuwpijn, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do have consonance, but they don't show perfect consonance since one word ends with -n while the other one doesn't.

In simple terms, word 'zenuwpijn' ends in -pijn - which has a hard consonant 'p' sound and 'navoelen' which is 'pain' ends in '-voelen' which is also a hard consonant sound 'f' and 'l' but 'en' is a vowel sound '-en' and '-oelen' are similar. So yes the Dutch words 'zenuwpijn' and '-navoelen" show some consonance.</s>
bekwaamden, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

1. "bekwaamden" (adjective meaning "competent" or "qualified") and "voorlig" (adverb meaning "in the front" or "forefront") both have the letters 'c' and 'k' followed by a 'w' in the last syllable.

Consonance is a figure of speech in which consonant sounds are repeated within a phrase or sentence, typically with similar or opposite meanings. It is a creative way to emphasize or draw out the impact of the repeated sounds as we hear them or pronounce them.</s>
tensie, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
wegdruip, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kielvlak, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance as they both contain similar consonants at the end of the words: "k" in kielvlak and "nd" in ordenden.</s>
uitstaand, toestond, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words "uitstaand" and "toestond" show consonance, as they both have the ending "on-" with some common sounds: /tʰ/ (th), /s/ (s), /ɒ/ (o), and /n/ (n). Note that the word "uitstaand" has a change of vowel sound in "staand," but that does not affect the consonance of the overall word pair.</s>
indeuk, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words 'indeuk-ordende' do not exhibit consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within words. In 'indeuk-ordende,' the repeated consonant is '-d,' which is a sibilant sound (sh/s sound) and not a common consonant sound. Furthermore, the spelling does not convey any strong consonant clusters like the Spanish language uses, where it's easier to see the consonant pattern. Therefore, this does not show any consonance at all.</s>
ijdele, deal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "ijdele-deal" shows consonance because the vowels are not separated by consonants (i, e, l, e in the first word and d, e in the second word):

ijdele-deal
| |  | |
i e l e - d e a l</s>
onderligger, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words "onderligger-ontruimt" show consonance because both words start with the same consonant "o" (onderligger - ontruimt). Consonance is a literary device where repetition of consonant sounds occurs in a line of text, and it can be achieved through various means such as clusters, initial consonants, final consonants, and repeated consonants in the middle of the words. In this case, both words start with "o," which creates consonance.</s>
oppep, pappen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "oppep-pappen" show consonance. 

Consonance occurs when words in a sentence have a consecutive repetition of consonant sounds. In this case, both words begin with the sound "opp-" and end with the sound "en". This creates a sound pattern across the two words, which is an example of consonance.</s>
feestten, afzoodt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

The word "feestten" has the word "feest," meaning "party" or "celebration," and the word "afzoodt" has the word "afzoeden," meaning "to punish" or "to discipline." Both words involve sounds that resonate or blend well together, making them consonant in terms of their overall structure or sounds. This type of consonance makes the words less distracting, more consistent, and thus easier to read, making them similar in terms of sounds and potentially meaning, due to the way consonant sounds influence each other in speaking and writing.</s>
ijselijkheid, slikhout, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "ijselijkheid" and "slikhout" show consonance since they both have the same ending (both ending in "-hout"). Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within syllables of a line.</s>
toer, etteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.</s>
planimetreer, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. These Dutch words do not show consonance. 

Justification: Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry or a sentence. In this example, "planimetreer-vadervreugde," the repetition of "r" is the only consonant sound that occurs in both words. While this repetition could be considered a minor aspect of rhythm or emphasis, it doesn't qualify as consonance based on the definition of the term. The original text does not exhibit any meaningful consonance between the words.</s>
voorlegt, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In both words, the first letter "v" and the last letter "e" are both consonants (in English, they are voiced consonants). And, the internal consonant clusters that arise from the word structure ("-oor-" in "voorlegt" and "-t-" in "tachisme") also exhibit consonance. It creates a rhythmic quality to the words that enhances their appearance similar to when you pronounce the words. 

Consonance can lead to the creation of a memorable sound, which, in turn, increases the effect of the wording or the text's overall appearance. This is especially powerful in poetry, where it can create an auditory and visual enhancement of the emotions being communicated.</s>
tensie, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two Dutch words (tensie-uitreikend) do not show consonance. The term "consonance" is used in poetry to describe a recurring or matching sound in words that are spelled or pronounced similarly, sometimes without having the same vowel sound. In this case, "tensie" and "uitreikend" have different sounds, as they are not spelled or pronounced similarly.</s>
Jut, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words "Jut-versmallen" do exhibit consonance, which is the repetition of consonant sounds. In this phrase, both words share the initial consonants "J," "u," and "t."</s>
houdt, heet, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. "Houdt" and "heet" are individual words and do not create a consonance when combined.</s>
naakt, neukten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "naakt" (naked) and "neukten" (kiss), do show consonance because both words end with the same consonant sounds (specifically "a"). Consonance is when two or more words with consonant sounds appear in succession in a poem or a sentence. Here, the ending consonant "a" is present in both words, which creates a pleasing effect in the sequence of words.</s>
immanent, menend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "immanent" and "menend" show consonance, as they both end with the consonant "nd." Both words end with the "n" sound [n] followed by the soft "d" sound [nd]. This is a common feature in Dutch consonant clusters.</s>
negerwijk, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

The first word, "negerwijk", consists of four syllables: "neg" (n), "er" (r), "wijk" (wk), and "invul" (nl). The consonant sounds in the syllables are (/n/, /r/, /w/, and /n/).

The second word, "invul", consists of two syllables: "in" (in) and "vul" (vl). The consonant sounds in the syllables are (/n/ and /vl/).

While the consonants in both words are the same (n, r, w, and vl), they do not form a consonant pattern that would allow them to show consonance.</s>
jut, computeriseer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

The consonance in this phrase occurs when there are three consecutive consonants or groups of consonants: "jut-" in "jut-computeriseer." These consonant clusters emphasize the sound or rhythm of the words by repeating consonants or groups of consonants in a row without including vowels. This results in a recognizable pattern that maintains a pleasing sound, contributing to the overall aesthetic appeal of the phrase.</s>
kruisbessestruiken, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the word combination "kruisbessestruiken-voorlieg," both words share similar-sounding consonant clusters at the beginning: "kr" in "kruisbessestruiken" and "kr" in "voorlieg." This onomatopoeic effect, where words have the same or similar sounds, is an example of consonance.</s>
zetterijen, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "zetterijen" and "voorlieg" do not show consonance.

Let's break down the individual words to help understand why consonance doesn't occur:

1. "Zetterijen" is derived from the Dutch noun "zetterij," which means a place for pressing or drying grapes. In this context, "zetterijen" means "estate vineyards" or "wine villages." 

2. "Voorlieg" is derived from the Dutch verb "loopen," which means "to walk" or "to run." When combined with the suffix "het" to form "voors," it becomes "voorslag" and ultimately "voorlieg," which means "exposure" or "expose" in English.

Despite both words containing the letter 'r' and having a similar spelling, they don't possess any actual consonant sounds in common, and as a result, don't show consonance.</s>
vlekt, vlakten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
detacheer, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "uitrokend" show consonance, as they both feature the consonant cluster "tt" in their middle syllables.

"Detacheer" means "to detach" in English, while "uitrokend" means "depleted" or "reduced" in English.

Consonance is a figure of speech where the alliteration or consonant-repeating phrase is repeated in a sentence. In linguistics, consonance is one of the structural patterns of language, where the repetition of consonants or consonant clusters can create a pleasing effect on the listener.</s>
naat, netto, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. 

The word "naat-netto" consists of two parts: "naat" and "netto". The first part "naat" means "song" or "hymn". The second part "netto" means "bright" or "clear".

The two parts don't display consonance in terms of a pattern of consonant sounds repeated. The vowel sounds are different in each segment: "naat" has an A sound while "netto" has a N sound. Therefore, "naat-netto" is not a consonant pair word which displays the consistent repetition of consonant sounds, hence it does not show consonance.</s>
knoei, knieen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "knoei-knieen" show consonance.

The reason for this is that the last sound in two consecutive words - 'een' (English equivalent: 'one'), is in the syllable of 'knieën' (English equivalent: 'to knee'). This happens when words are paired together and the final sound of the first word in the pair is repeated in the second word to create consonance, also known as onomatopoeia. Here, 'knieën' gives a knee sound and 'een' rhymes with it. Hence, the words are consonant with each other in the context of sound (morpheme).

In Dutch, words are often used in onomatopoeic phrases, mimicking the sounds that these words denote. 

The Dutch words knoei-knieen or knoeien-snijden are examples of consonance; it's as if we are making these words to sound similar for better understanding.</s>
Zweed, zwad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Zweed" and "zwad" show consonance. Both words have the consonant "w" (or pronounced as a "v") in their middle consonant cluster, which contributes to their similarity as they share a similar sound. This type of sound repetition is known as consonance, a figure of speech where a pattern of similar sounding consonant or consonant clusters is used, typically for emphasis or to enhance the artistic effect.</s>
omsingel, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Justification: It is important to understand that consonance occurs when there is a repetition of consonant sounds in a phrase or sentence. Dutch words do not always exhibit consonance because the language does not have a strict rule for making such repetitions. However, the words "omsingel" (encompass) and "esthetica" (aesthetics) both have a similar sound at the beginning (the 'm' sound), but this does not qualify as consonance as the words' meanings are not consonant (in this case, 'encompass' and 'aesthetics').</s>
modi, maden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "modi-maden" show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in a sequence of words, phrases, or lines in a piece of literature or text. "Modi-maden" is the Dutch word for "mode-made," which is a term used in fashion and fashion design, indicating the process of creating and producing garments and accessories.

The "modi" and "maden" in the phrase create a pattern of consonant sounds, which contributes to the overall rhythm and flow of the word. In this case, the "m" sound is repeated in both words.</s>
Jut, satansboleten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Let's analyze the given words and their structure to understand why consonance is present:

1. Jut-satansboleten: The word "satansboleten" contains a series of consonant clusters, which are represented by the following syllables:
 - J-ut-J-u-t-J-u-t-J-u-t-J-u-t (with the repeated 'J' at the beginning of the vowel 'ut', giving it an elongated sound)
 - s-a-t-a-n-s-b-o-l-e-t-e-n

Consonance is a poetic device that is evident when similar consonant sounds are found in close proximity or when repeated in a pattern. In this case, the repeated 'J' in "satansboleten" and the multiple instances of similar consonant-vowel combinations create the effect of consonance, thus making these words show consonance.</s>
piekt, pocket, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both "piekt" and "pocket" have the letter "k" in their sound, creating a consonant pattern that echoes or "consonances" each other.</s>
etappe, atopie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'etappe' and 'atopie' show consonance. The term "consonance" in poetry refers to a shared pattern of consonant sounds between words within a line, usually with a repeating or similar set of front (palatal) consonants. In both words, the c- sounds are found in the middle (at the beginning and end) of the words, and the pattern is maintained throughout. This shared pattern of consonant sounds can create a musical and harmonious quality to the words as they are read or heard, adding an additional sense of rhythm or melody to the language.</s>
psychoanalytici, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when there are repeated consonant sounds in a sequence, and these words don't show any sequence of repeated consonants. The word contains "-ico" which resembles the Greek prefix "psych-" (meaning soul, life, mind), and "-vooreinde" which is a Dutch expression meaning "ahead / upon" but is not used as a consolidate element.</s>
voorlieg, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance because the final letters of "tachisme" are not repeated in "voorlieg." In consonance, words share similar or identical final sounds. Here, "l" and "g" sound different in the two words.</s>
kerkerende, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kerkerende-statica" show consonance. Consonance is a literary device where similar consonant sounds appear in close proximity within a word or phrase. In this case, consonant sounds "r" and "s" are repeated in the word "kerkerende-statica," which creates a pleasing and aural effect. Both parts of the compound word, "kerkerende" which means "whining" and "statica," are created by similar consonants, contributing to the consonance.</s>
Jut, reproducenten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-reproducenten" show consonance. Consonance is the repetition of similar or consonant sounds in words, and in this case, the '-j-' consonant sound is repeated at the beginning of each word, making it an example of consonance.</s>
onecht, nacht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "onecht-nacht" show consonance as both ends of the words have the same consonant, -cht. This is an example of a consonantal ending which is quite common in Dutch language that helps in creating fluidity and rhythm in sentences.</s>
plantluis, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "plantluis" and "pruimenboomgaarden," do show consonance. The first word, "plantluis," consists of the syllables "plant," "luis," wherein "plant" consists of the consonant clusters "pl" and "nt," while "luis" has the consonant cluster "l" at the end. The second word, "pruimenboomgaarden," has a similar consonant pattern, with the consonant clusters "pruim," "m," "b," "oo," "m," "g," "aa," "r," "d," "n," and "r." The repeated use of the consonant clusters "p" and "m" in both words contributes to the overall consonance in these Dutch words.</s>
moquette, omkaad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both Dutch words "moquette" and "omkaad" show consonance.

In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of consonants in words. Here, both words "moquette" and "omkaad" have the consonant "k" at the end, thus demonstrating consonance.

"Moquette" comes from the French word meaning "velvet upholstery," while "omkaad" is a Dutch word meaning "turned upside down." These words are not related but share the phonetic similarity of the "k" sound at the end, contributing to their consonance.</s>
micro, omkeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

'Micro-omkeren' consists of the same consonants, "M C R O", repeated twice. In this case, the structure of the word gives it a somewhat similar sound to another word we can identify as 'broomrood' (broom red). This may create a subtle consonance effect. Consonance is a literary device where two or more words have similar consonants. Here, 'Micro-omkeren' and 'broomrood' both have the consonant clusters 'Mcr ORd,' so consonance can be seen in this pair of words.</s>
jut, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-treknet" show consonance, as the consonant sounds "j-t-n" in each word occur again in the same positions.</s>
taswoning, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "taswoning-esthetica" show consonance because both words share the consonant pattern "sw-" (from "tas" and "taswoning") and "sh" (from "esthetica"). Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when a repeated consonant sound or consonantal patterns create a sense of unity and coherence in the written or spoken text. In this case, the repetition of "sh" in both words contributes to their consonant unity and helps create a pleasing effect for the reader or listener.</s>
binnenstroomden, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words do show consonance. Let me give you an explanation:

1. In the word "binnenstroomden," the sequence of consonants (V/C/V/V/C/V/V) is repeated in the word "wegdruip." This creates a pattern of similar sounds, making the words appear consonant-wise similar to each other (similar cluster or set of consonant sounds).

Justification: The consonance in "binnestroomden" and "wegdruip" is a result of the repetition of consonant sounds found in these two Dutch words. This similarity in pronunciation and structural organization gives them a consonantal relationship.</s>
roken, rik, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "roken" and "rik" show consonance.

In the given words, the consonant clusters are "o-k in roken" and "i-k in rik". This is a common feature of Dutch language, where consonant clusters are quite common. Additionally, the fact that the words are in the verb and adjective form respectively also contributes to the consonant balance.</s>
aderen, door, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "aderen-door" show consonance. The word "aderen," which means "throat," has two consecutive "n" sounds similar to the second and third sounds of the word "door" which means "through." Consonance is a literary device that occurs when repeated consonant sounds are found in succession.</s>
plantluis, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in words, usually in close proximity to each other. In the provided words "plantluis-voorlichtte", there is no consonant sound repetition that would suggest consonance.</s>
kwintalen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In the words "kwintalen" and "ontruimd," the consonant sounds "k" and "n" appear in both words in close proximity, as the first letter of the first word and the second letter of the second word, and vice versa. This is known as onset consonance and is a common linguistic feature in Dutch. The "t" in "ontruimt" also comes closer to the end of the word, like in the first word, further contributing to the consonance. Both words share the same rhyme as well, which indicates a relationship between these words in the Dutch language.</s>
onheil, inhalen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. The word "onheil" has two vowels (ö) and two consonants (on-heil), while the word "inhalen" has six vowels (i-n-h-ä-l-ä-n) and four consonants (in-h-ä-l-ä-n). The pattern of vowel and consonant sounds in these words creates a similar sound throughout the word, leading to a sense of consonance, which is a similar or related pattern in the sounds of words.</s>
narratiefste, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words "narratiefste-voorlegt" do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to two or more vowel sounds within a phrase or sentence that are followed by the same or similar consonant sounds. In this case, the words "narratiefste" and "voorlegt" are individual words rather than a phrase or a sentence. "Narratiefste" can be translated to "most significant" or "most critical" in English, while "voorlegt" generally means "presentation" or "speech."

Therefore, these words do not exhibit consonance as they are separate words with their own distinct spellings and meanings.</s>
guit, achtte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

In the provided words "guit-achtte", there is a clear repetition of the consonant 'g' between the last two syllables - "gu" and "tte". This repetition creates a pleasing and unified sound to the words, which we call consonance, in poetry. It's a kind of poetic technique in which more than one syllable is used in the same language.

So in this particular word, the consonance is present because of the presence of 'g' sound repeated in the final two syllables of the word. This gives it an alliteration-like effect, where the 'g' sound is heard consistently in two places making it more captivating and interesting in terms of a sonic rhythm in poetry.</s>
poreust, persten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance as the words both share the similar consonant clusters "poreu-" and "-sten". Consonance is a rhetorical device where consecutive consonants, vowels, or syllables in a line of poetry create a particular sound effect. By sharing similar consonant clusters, the words create a sense of unity in their sounds and may enhance the rhythm and flow of the sentence.</s>
trompetboom, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance. The consonants "p", "t", "m", "b", "r", "j" in the word "trompetboom" are repeated in "schreeuweriger", sharing similar consonant sounds.</s>
gerood, graad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Both words "gerood" (crimson) and "graad" (grade), contain the same consonant group "rd." The consonance is created as a result of the sound-similarity between the /r/ and /d/ sounds in the words.</s>
tensie, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie-negerwijk" show consonance. 

The reason for this is that the letters "s", "n", and "w" have been paired with syllables in such a way that they are adjacent consonant sounds. The two words "tensie" and "negerwijk" are similar in structure because their first syllables are also consonant-heavy. Consequently, when you put them together it creates an almost unbroken consonant run at the beginning, hence the concept of "consonance".</s>
aspot, spuiten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
vuilpersleiding, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Vuilpersleiding and radende both contain a set of consonants at the beginning, followed by consonants at the end of the word making their rhymes or consonance pattern, respectively. This is a common practice in Dutch language as well.</s>
erica, roekoe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word pair "erica" and "roekoe" show consonance, which is a literary device where the end sounds of words are similar. In this case, both words end with the sound /k/.</s>
oppikten, piekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. The word "oppikten" has a consonant pattern of VWG, while "piekt" has a consonant pattern of WG. In order for them to show consonance, both words would need to have the same consonant pattern.</s>
toque, taco, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toque-taco" show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech where like consonant sounds are used together in succession. In this case, the letter "c" is the consonant that appears at the end of the words as both a /t/ and /k/ sound, giving this repetition a pleasing effect. This sound effect can add emphasis and create rhythm in the word, similar to that of a rhyme. The two items toque and taco, despite the difference in the type of hat and the type of food, both end with the /t/ and /k/ sound, creating the consolidated effect, allowing them to show consonance.</s>
zenuwpijn, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. 

Justification: 

Consonance is a poetical device wherein similar consonant sounds are reproduced to create rhythmic effect. In this case, both 'zenuwpijn' (neuralgia) and 'statica' (static) have 's-' prefix followed by 'ta', the only difference being a change in the letter 'n' to 'c' but that does not substantially alter the pronunciation. Therefore the consonance between the words remains significant. 'Static' is indeed consonant with 'statica' in every sense. Thus, both the words possess consonance. 

The same concept of sound echoes in words also holds true in other languages, for instance, similar words found in English might also have this effect, for instance, 'shelf' and 'self', both starting with 's'. Both the words are pronounced like s-s-f or s-l-f. The 's' sound is repeated and this technique of repeating the sound can be termed as consonance.</s>
fot, fouten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "fot-fouten" do show consonance. Both words contain identical pairs of consonants: "ft" and "ou" in "fot" and "fouten," respectively. The consonant sounds and the identical spelling give the words a similar, pleasing or balanced appeal, which contributes to the effect of consonance.</s>
laagt, logt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words exhibit consonance. Both words contain the sequence "l-a-g-t" and "l-o-g-t" which are similar sounding consonant clusters in the Dutch language. This similar sounding consonant sequence gives them a structural resemblance and contributes to the perception of consonance.</s>
ritmeren, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance, as there is no recurring consonant pattern or sound similarity between the two words. 

In the words "ritmeren" and "handicaprace," "ritmeren" is an infinitive verb meaning "to time" or "to measure" in English, while "handicaprace" is an adjective that refers to an organized running race where participants are given a disadvantage in order to evenly match the competition. These words have different meanings and don't share any common consonant pattern.</s>
fleuren, foulard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words show consonance because both "fleuren" and "foulard" contain the sound 'l' followed by the sound 'r' as in the letters 'l' and 'r'. In Dutch, the sound represented by 'l' and 'r' is pronounced like 'r' in the word 'car'. Therefore, the similar pattern of vowels and consonants in these words creates a consonant sound in both of them, hence called consonance.</s>
cel, salut, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Although the words "cel" and "salut" are not in common consonance, a consonant similarity is present due to the presence of the letter 's' in both words. The word "cel" has two s's, and 'salut' also contains a single 's'. Although the sounds or meanings of the words are not consonant, linguistically, the s is a consonant and does bring a sense of matching or consonance. So, these two Dutch words possess a 's' in each, and thus can be considered showing slightly consonant.</s>
hutst, hitste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "hutste" and "hitste" show consonance.

In this case, the consonance occurs between the letters "t" that appear at the end of each word, demonstrating a pattern or similarity in their consonant sounds. This is an example of a phonetic consonance, where two words share the same consonants or sounds, without necessarily sharing the same vowel sounds.</s>
detacheer, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "detacheer-voorlichtte" show consonance.

Consonance is a literary device that occurs when successive vowel sounds within a line of poetry are repeated. In this case, the same vowel sound ("o") appears in the words "detacheer" and "voorlichtte," creating a connection between the words that emphasizes their related meanings.</s>
antwoordend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Here's a justification of the consonance:

In both words, you can notice the presence of the consonant 's' (pronounced as 'z'), which is very frequently used in Dutch to make words more pronouncible and to have smooth vowel sounds. This 'z' is used to make long vowels shorter and adds consonant to the endings of words.

'Antwoordend' (meaning 'answering') ends with 's', and 'statica' (meaning 'statics') ends with 's' as well. The two endings 'antwoordend-statica' are more connected with 's' that creates a nice consonance flow. 

In the Dutch language, it's considered very normal to have such 's' ending words, and also it makes phonetic sense in the dialects that use double consonants after vowels, such as 'Vos' in Frisian, or 'Zuid' in West Frisian languages. This helps to give an appearance of a regular, pronounceable Dutch word.</s>
genius, gienjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonance between the Dutch words "genius" and "gienjes" can be seen in the fact that they share the similar-sounding consonant sequence "g."</s>
verbeurd, voorboort, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
etnisch, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch-brandverzekering" show consonance. 

In this word, the consonants "tn," "-nd," and "-rkering" are similar in both syllables, creating a pleasing harmony or sound similarity. This quality of onomatopoeia can be referred to as consonance, where the consonants help make the word easier to pronounce or add to the overall effect of the word in its intended context.</s>
esters, satyrs, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the Dutch words esters-satyrs do not show consonance.

Consonance occurs when recurring consonant sounds occur within a line of poetry. In this case, both words are made up of different consonant sounds: 's' in 'esters' and 's' in 'satyrs.' Therefore, the words do not exhibit consonance as required. Furthermore, the words are semantically distinct (related to esters and satyrs, respectively) which also disqualifies the term "consonance" from being suitable in this context.</s>
bagatellen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do show consonance.

Consonance is a rhetorical device in which the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or at the beginnings of syllables draws attention to language sounds and creates a rhythmic pattern. In the Dutch words "bagatellen" and "invul," the ending consonant "l" is repeated, creating a rhythm and consonance. Additionally, the beginning consonants "b" and "i" in "bagatellen" and "invul" are similar, contributing to the consonance found in these words.</s>
joysticks, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "joysticks-tachisme," show consonance. 

In this case, both words have the same consonant sounds: "j" (as in "jack"), "s" (as in "she"), "t" (as in "two"), and "s" (as in "see"). This results in a rhyming effect and consonance between the words. Consonance is a literary device that uses repetition of consonant sounds in a word or a sequence of words to create a poetic effect.</s>
treknet, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words show consonance because they both have a "t-l-w" pattern in the middle of the words, which creates a similar sound and rhythm. The first word, "treknet," has "t-r-k" followed by "n-t," while the second word, "lawinegevaar," has "l-w-n" followed by "g-v-r." This sounds and structure align making them appear consonant to the ear.</s>
brij, bourree, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "brij" and "bourree" show consonance because both words end in the same sequence of consonant sounds, which is "-rre" (brij-rre and bourree-rre).</s>
voorlegt, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two Dutch words show consonance because both words share similar consonants at the beginning of the words. However, it is important to note that consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds rather than just similar consonants. Still, in this case, the repeated "e" sound adds to the sound similarity.</s>
jut, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These words show consonance as they share a repeating consonant pattern: "j-u-t-p-l-a-n-i-m-e-r".</s>
verlichtten, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or at the beginning and end of words. In the given Dutch words "verlichtten" and "sciopticons," there is no repeating consonant sound. The words are unrelated and do not show any consonant repetition that would make them belong to the same group of words with consonant consonance.

It is important to note that the meaning of words and sounds can sometimes go beyond the strict criteria of consonance. Despite not showing consonance, the two words might still have a similar vowel sound structure ("e" and "i"). However, this similarity is not enough to label the two words as consonantly similar.</s>
loopgravenstellingen, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words 'loopgravenstellingen' and 'detacheer' show consonance.

In the words 'loopgravenstellingen', the 'l' and 'g' are both voiceless stops, as are the 'n' and 't' in 'detacheer'. The sound patterns that involve stopping sounds that are the same. This is a type of consonance known as consonantal consonance, where two words have similar patterns of stops, flaps, or nasals.

Similarly, in the word 'detacheer', the 't' and 'h' are both voiceless stops. These two words with similar consonant patterns can be considered to show consonance.</s>
vrijheidsklasse, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Based on the provided words "vrijheidsklasse-nadook," there appears to be minimal consonance.

Answer: No

Justification: Even though both words have the letter "n" and "d," they don't share any other common sounds. Therefore, there is no significant level of consonance present in these words. Furthermore, "vrijheidsklasse" (freedom class) and "nadook" (basket) have very different meanings, and in this context, they are written in a completely different sentence structure.</s>
jut, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

The word "jut-kwintalen" (mixed measure) is a compound word consisting of two parts: "jut," which means to jut or protrude, and "kwintalen," which means fifths. Both parts have unrelated sounds and do not exhibit any consonance pattern.</s>
jut, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut-lawinegevaar" show consonance, as both words end with the consonant sound "r." Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when consecutive same or similar consonant sounds are used, which can create a pleasing effect to the reader or listener. This play on consonant sounds helps reinforce the shared meaning and theme in these two words.</s>
offset, afsta, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, they do not.

The given Dutch words "offset-afsta" do not show consonance. Consonance is a rhetorical device where like consonants are used close together. In this sentence, the Dutch words "offset" and "afsta" only share a resemblance in the initial 'a' sound, making it more of a phonetic similarity rather than genuine consonance.</s>
joysticks, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These Dutch words, "joysticks" and "schreeuweriger," do not show consonance. While both words do contain the consonant sound "r," the structure and meaning of the words are completely separate, and therefore no specific consonance or shared feature can be found between them. The words represent distinct concepts in Dutch language, one indicating a control device for video games, and the other describing being loud or shrill, respectively.</s>
kielvlak, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance as they have different consonants in their second place: 'v' vs 'r'. The only consonant in both words is at the end, but this does not make them consonant related in the second place.</s>
apparaat, oprijdt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not show consonance. In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of certain sounds – consonant sounds – within the same word or between closely related words. However, in your given phrase "apparaat-oprijdt", there was no repetition of any sounds that are traditionally considered consonant sounds.

Let's try to understand this better through phonetics. In Dutch, 'apparaat' can be broken down into 'app-aar-aat.' - In this case, 'app' is a sequence of labial fricative consonants (in English, it would represent "ap" or "ap" of "apple"). The syllable 'oprijdt' breaks down as 'op-riij-dt' where 'riij-dt' involves a sequence of two bilabial stops, 'pp' or 'pt' (the 'P' in 'apple' followed by the 't' sound in 'eat'). So, these are consonant sounds that could create consonance.</s>
noveer, aanvuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "noveer" (January) and "aanvuur" (firing, ignition) show consonance.

In this case, both words start with the same consonant, "n". 

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning, middle or end of words within a line of poetry or prose. This technique can add rhythm or emphasis to a spoken or written passage. In this example, the consonant sound "n" in the two words reinforces one another, helping to create a sense of rhythm or musicality in the language.</s>
extraherend, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words, "extraherend-nadook" (extraction-nodal) show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when consecutive vowel sounds or consonant sounds in a phrase are repeated, either from the same syllable or across different syllables (known as alliteration or assonance, respectively). In each word "extraherend" and "nadook," we can see that some of the consonant sounds are reiterated, creating patterns of repeated consonance (alliteration in this case).</s>
rasvee, recief, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words have consonance because both words share a group of consonant sounds at the beginning while being linked using spaces of the alphabets. The first consonant of 'rasvee' is a 'r' sound and that of 'recief' is also an 'r' sound. The remaining consonants in 'rasvee' and 'recief' are also identical apart from being in a reverse order. The consonant 's' at the end is another factor contributing to the consonance. Hence, both words show consonance in the form of a shared sound at their initiation.</s>
piepjongst, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst-indeuk" do show consonance. 

This is because both words are Dutch compound words, consisting of two parts that share consonants in a similar way. In this case, 'ij' (representing 'y' and 'i') is the same consonant in both words. Additionally, the word "indeuk" contains a vowel shift that connects with the previous word, creating consonance in a syllable and letter pattern.</s>
duif, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words show consonance since they both end in the same consonant sound "n."</s>
hoes, heuse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "hoes" and "heuse" show consonance. Consonance is a figure of speech where the same consonant sounds are used at the end or in the middle of two or more words in a sequence. In both words "hoes" and "heuse", the vowel 'o' is followed by the same consonant 's'. This repetition creates a pleasant and harmonious sound, which is commonly referred to as consonance.</s>
trompetboom, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words show consonance as they both have similar consonants in each word of the phrase:

1. trompetboom (trumpet tree)
2. (t)romp (ship's hull)
3. (t)rompte (trumpeted)
4. b(t)oom (boom)
5. v(t)er (over)
6. (t)er (for)
7. v(t)erlichten (to illuminate)
8. (t)werk (work)
9. (t)werkde (worked)

Each part of the phrase shares at least one consonant, contributing to the consonance effect and creating a rhythmic, musical quality to the phrase "trompetboom-verluchtten."</s>
erratisch, rits, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
abstinentieverschijnsel, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
duif, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.</s>
feestten, afsta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'feestten' and 'afsta' show consonance.

Justification:
- In English, 'feestten' means 'to celebrate' or 'to throw a party' (feest = party, and ten = to).
- 'Afsta' means 'to stop' or 'to give up' (af = away, sta = be, also a suffix meaning stop - same in Danish 'afstå').
- Both words consist of 3 consonants in a row. For example, 'f' is repeated in both words, followed by 'estten' and 'afsta' respectively, each with three consonants.

From this analysis, we can say that these two words demonstrate consonance, especially as both end in 't' which enhances the sound created by their 3-consonant structure.</s>
doorroestten, doorreisd, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || To determine if the given Dutch words demonstrate consonance, let's first discuss what consonance is. 

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words or syllables in adjacent lines. This repetition can create a pleasing effect and create rhythm and musicality in the text. So, to answer your question, the Dutch words "doorroestten" and "doorreisd" do not demonstrate consonance.

Here's a breakdown of the words and syllable structures:

* doorroestten (duːroːˈrœsntɛ) - "doorrost" (ˈduːroːrɔst]): The Dutch word "doorroestten" is spelled and pronounced like "doorrost," which does not contain any repetitive consonant sounds.
* doorreisd (duːroːrˌeːs) - "doorreist" (ˈduːroːrɛist]): This is the comparative form of "doorreizen" (ˈduːroːrˌeːzɛn] = "doorreizen"), which means "to travel through" or "to travel around." The repetition of the "r" sound in the comparative form supports consonance, but the actual word "doorreisd" (including the stress) does not resemble "doorrost."

In conclusion, the given Dutch words "doorroestten" and "doorreisd" do not demonstrate consonance.</s>
Euromarkt, oormerkte, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
vrijheidsklasse, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vrijheidsklasse-taswoning" show consonance. 

In this phrase, the consonant sounds in "-tas-" and "-woning-" are the same between the two words. For example, the "s" sound at the end of "tas" matches the "s" sound in "woning." This repetition of sound creates a musical rhythm and gives the phrase a pleasing quality in Dutch.</s>
vuilpersleiding, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vuilpersleiding-invallen" show consonance, as they contain a series of consecutive consonants, "v", "u", "i", and "n". Consonance is a poetic device that creates a rhythm in poetry by repeating identical or similar consonant sounds at the end of words or sounds. In this case, the consonance creates a pleasingly rhythmic structure. The Dutch words "vuilpersleiding-invallen" follow a pattern of "v", "i", and "n", a pattern that is common in Dutch orthography to mark long and short vowel sounds respectively.</s>
hem, hum, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
openlaat, poelt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words, "openlaat" and "poelt", share several consonants that are in close proximity of each other in the word, making for a sound or pattern that creates a harmonious and pleasing musical rhythm, a concept known as consonance in literature and linguistics.</s>
tensie, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

In the words tensie-ontduik, the consonants are T,S,E,N, and V. They are all pronounced as [t], [s], [ɛ], [n], and [f]. Consonance occurs when two or more words in a sentence, or in our case, two separate words, share a group of final consonant sounds.</s>
voorlig, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlig" and "ordende" show consonance. The word "voorlig" is related to the verb "openliggen," which means "to lie open." The word "ordende" is related to the word "orden," meaning "order." Both words end in the consonant "de," which creates similarity and consonance in the original Dutch words.</s>
meridionaal, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Let's break down each word to analyze why they show consonance:

1. 'meridionaal' - It means "tropical" or "local" in English. The word consists of two syllables: merid-i-onal and has words starting with 'M' and 'R'. 

2. 'invul' - It means "fill" or "infiltrate" in English. The word consists of two syllables: in-vul and starts with a 'V' sound at the end of the word.

Both words share the "M" and "R" sounds to some degree, and both also start with consonant sounds. Therefore, we can conclude that these words show some degree of consonance between them.</s>
attentie, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words shown, "attentie-verlichter," do show consonance because both words have similar consonant sounds and share phonetic similarities in certain syllables. This is a common poetical technique used to make the phrases more memorable and rhythmic.</s>
bat, bood, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. The words "bat" and "bood" are distinct in spelling and pronunciation, and do not share any identifiable consonant patterns. Consonance is a literary technique where recurring consonant sounds are used to emphasize and connect words within a phrase, sentence, or stanza. In this case, the words do not exhibit such a pattern, making it unsuitable for use as consonance.</s>
polo, peil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'polo-peil' show consonance. 

On closer inspection, the word 'polo-peil' consists of two parts, '-polo' and '-peil', which maintain similar or matching consonant sounds in the second part of the word. 

- 'polo': has a strong 'P' sound, followed by a light 'o' sound.
- 'peil': has a light 'P' sound, followed by a lighter 'e' sound, and an even lighter 'i' sound in the final syllable.

The repetition of the 'P' sound in each component of the word contributes to the consonance between 'polo-peil'. This concept can be illustrated as the similar arrangement of consonant sounds across syllables where 'P' appears again.</s>
trompetbomen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given Dutch words "trompetbomen-statica" show consonance.

Justification:

Consonance is a poetic technique that involves using the same or similar consonant sounds at the ends of adjacent words or at the ends of words and syllables within a line. In the given Dutch words, there are two syllables in the word "trompetbomen" and then a single consonant in the word "statica." These consonant sounds at the end of the words create a pleasing, rhythmic effect which consonance aims to achieve. Trompetbomen is the Dutch word for "trumpet trees," and statica is the Dutch word for "static."</s>
duif, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Analyzing the words, both "duif" and "zetterijen" (Dutch for "duck coop" or "poultry farms") have "d-" in the beginning, which shows consonance. Furthermore, the words also contain the "ij" sound, which is a common consonant cluster in the Dutch language. This consonancy contributes to the overall sound and structure of the sentence.</s>
zenuwpijn, satansboleten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Justification: In both words, there are five vowel sounds used, with the first three vowels, 'o', 'e', and 'e', repeated in the same order. The repeated vowels create a subtle pattern or sound combination, which is called consonance. However, note that this is a very basic definition, and in Dutch, words can use consonance without following this rule.</s>
ordende, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words ordende-esthetiek show consonance, as both words have the sound of "nd" repeated in the middle.</s>
jut, binnenstormde, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These Dutch words do not exhibit consonance, as consonance in a linguistic sense refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within words (sounds like "b-p-m," "t-k-t," etc.) or between the words in a phrase or sentence. In the given Dutch words "jut-binnenstormde," the characters j and b are both consonants, not vocal sounds. Consequently, these words do not satisfy the criteria for consonance.</s>
jut, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words end with "le," which is a common consonantal ending in Dutch.</s>
rabat, eerbied, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These Dutch words, "rabat-eerbied," show consonance in the way that they both end with the same consonant sounds "t" and "b" in the words "rabatt" and "eerbied," respectively. Consonance is a rhetorical technique that involves repeating consonant sounds within a line of poetry or written text.</s>
kielvlak, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance. Although the two listed words share phonetic structures, there is no overt phonetic pattern or consonance present between the words. "Kielvlak" (kel-vlaak) is a noun meaning "cavity" or "basin", "ingestort" (in-ghs-tort) is a past participle of the verb "ingestorten", meaning "collapsing" in this context. The 'vlak' in 'kielvlak' and the word without '-ingestort' in the second word 'ingestort' share the same syllable structure but the consonant sounds aren't consonant-consonant-long vowel like in the example word 'koolvlaag', so it's not a case of consonance here.</s>
inmijnt, aanmuntten, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

There is no direct consonance between the words "inmijnt" (lit. "penetrates") and "aanmuntten" (lit. "supplementing") in Dutch. Although both words contain "mijnt" in their structure, they are derived from different roots and serve different purposes in the sentences they are used in.

The vowel and consonant combinations between the two words differ as well. "Inmijnt" has a pattern of [in-mijnt], while "aanmuntten" has a pattern of [aan-munt-en], with the only shared consonant being "m." The consonant "n" is also found in both words, but the way it is used is different in each instance, as can be seen by the various meanings of the words.

In summary, "inmijnt" is a verb suggesting penetration or entering, while "aanmuntten" is a gerund (a -ing verb ending) meaning supplementing or providing additional. Although both have "mijnt" in their structure, there is no clear consonance between them.</s>
bette, bood, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "bette-bood" shows consonance, as the consonants "b" and "o" appear frequently in the same order in both words. This pattern in word structure creates a sense of repetition and rhythm, contributing to the effect of consonance.</s>
pythisch, oppoetsen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these Dutch words do not show consonance.

Justification: Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds, especially at the ends of words or within words or stressed syllables, in close proximity. "Pythisch" and "oppoetsen" (which are Dutch verbs meaning "to defeat" or "to face") do not have any immediate consonant sounds that are the same or in close proximity to each other in these words. Therefore, the presence of consonance would depend on further examination of the meaning and context in which they are used. But based on the form and structure of these words, they do not show consonance.</s>
offset, afzoodt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Justification:
Both words "offset" and "afzoodt" have the same ending "-zoodt," which features a distinct group of consonants (here, "z" and "d"). Consonance is a repetition or matching of consonant sounds in words. Since the ending "-zoodt" appears in both words, it falls under the consonance category.</s>
meridionaal, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of similar consonant sounds in the same line or the same word. In this case, both words share the same consonant pattern as well as specific consonant sounds. Specifically, they both end in the "tn" sound. Therefore, the words do show consonance.</s>
kelderdeur, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These words do not show consonance because they have different letters, even though they could be pronounced similarly. "Kelderdeur" means "cellar door" in English, and "duif" means "dove" in Dutch. Although they are both untranslated, the meanings and consonance are not the same.</s>
inetste, ontziet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these Dutch words show consonance. Both words, "inetste" and "ontziet," have similar consonant sounds in their word structure, namely "st" and "tz." This quality is characteristic of consonance, which refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in a sequence of words.</s>
tensie, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The Dutch words 'tensie-ritmeren' exhibit consonance, as both words contain the sequence 'ens-' in their formation. Consonance refers to the repetition of similar sounds, and in this case, the two words share the consonant pattern 'ns-', making them appear more closely connected and poetic.</s>
