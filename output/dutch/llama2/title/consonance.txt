gekaaide, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the word "gekaaide" does not show consonance in Dutch because it contains two vowel sounds (i and e) that do not have the same sound quality or position in the syllable.

kwats, equatie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the word "kwarts" does not exhibit consonance in its pronunciation or spelling. Consonance refers to the repetition of similar sounds within a word or phrase, typically at different syllables.

The word "nadook" also lacks consensus since it consists of two vowels without any repeating consonants.</s>
computeriseer, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the word "computeriseur" does not exhibit consonance in Dutch as there is no repetition of consonant sounds within the word itself. The combination of "c" and "t" at the beginning of the word do form a consonant cluster, but they are separated by a vowel sound (the letter "o") which breaks up the pattern of consonance. Therefore, this word cannot be considered an example of consonance in Dutch

psychoanalytici, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the word "psychoanalytici" does not show consonance in Dutch.

In Dutch, the letter combination "-nd-" is typically pronounced as /n/ or /ŋ/, so the word "psychoanalyti" would be pronounced with an initial nasal sound rather than a stop consonant like /k/. The suffix "-ck-" also doesn't tend to cause consonance in Dutch, so the final sy
ontruimt, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch word "ontruimt" shows consonance with the suffix "-chtten," which is a common pattern in Dutch to form adjectives that end in -cht or -chten. This suffix indicates that the noun it modifies has something related to cleaning or purification.

feestten, afzoodt, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the word "feest" does not have the same ending sound as "taak". The two sounds do not match, so they do not form consonant clusters or patterns in this case.</s>
