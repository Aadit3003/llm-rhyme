kamerlid, kappersaus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kamerlid" and "kappersaus" start with the letter combination "/k/" which represents the /kh/ or hard K sound in English.Justification:* The first word is pronounced as "KAM-er-lid", where the initial consonantal cluster starts with the letters "KA".* Similarly, the second word is pronounced as "KHAP-pers-oos", again starting with the sounds "KA".Given that they share this identical phonetic sequence
sydniers, serredeur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "syndniers" starts with the /s/ sound (a voiceless alveolar fricative), which is also present at the beginning of the second word "serredeur". Although there might seem to be some slight differences in spelling between them, both words share the initial /s/ phoneme, making their starting sounds identical.<|eot_id|>
wegdruip, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "wegdruip" starts with the /w/ sound (a voiceless labiovelar approximant), which is also present in the second word "radende". Both sounds share the initial /r/d/w sequence that forms this distinctive phonetic pattern characteristic of some Germanic languages like Dutch.<|eot_id|>
haverpluim, hockeyclubs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "haver" (hay) and "hockey" start with the /h/ sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed 'H', which represents the voiceless glottal fricative phoneme in English pronunciation (/h/) or the voiced labiodental fricative phoneme in Dutch pronunciation ([ɦ]). This indicates that they share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
vochtende, vouwblinden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "vochtende" starts with the /v/ sound (a voiceless labiodental fricative), which is represented by the letter combination 'vh'.Similarly, the second word "vouwbllenden" also begins with the /v/ sound (again a voiced labiodental fricative). This time, it's spelled as 'vw' or sometimes written without any vowel between them like 'vb'. So, both words start with
dubbelsprongen, doortrapt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "dubbelsprongen" and "doortrapten" start with the /d/ sound.Justification:The word "dubbelsprongen" begins with the letter combination "/dub-", which is pronounced as /duːb/. The word "doortrapten", on the other hand, starts with the letters "/door-". Although they differ in their second part ("sprong-" vs "-trappen"), at the beginning of each word,
zondagssluiting, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zondagsluiting" and "Estheticăa" (assuming you meant to type this instead of esthetica) start with the /z/ or /sʰ/ phoneme.Justification:In the first word "Zondagsluiting", we see that it begins with the letter combination "zn". In standard Dutch pronunciation, when followed by other letters like 'd', 'g' etc., the sequence "zn" is pronounced as
kielvlak, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "kielvlak" starts with /k/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "aanvijl". In phonetics, both words have the initial consonantal sound represented by "/k/" in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two Dutch words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
reproducenten, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "reproducenten", starts with the letter combination /rɛ/. The second word, "-voorgelieg" (note: I assume there is no space between -vor- and -gelieg), also begins with the letters "/v/" which represents the voiceless labiodental fricative [f] in phonetics, but since this is not possible to write accurately without proper diacritics, we can consider them as starting with approximately
avondfeesten, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "avond" and "voor" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative consonant.Justification:* The word "avond" begins with the letter combination "a-v", which is pronounced as /ɑːfʌnt/, where "/v/" represents the voiceless bilabial plosive.* Similarly, the word "voor" starts with the letters "v-o-r".In standard Dutch pronunciation, this sequence
gekaaide, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "gekaaide" starts with /g/, which is also the initial consonantal sound of the second word "planimeteren". In phonetics, both sounds can be transcribed as [ɡ]. Although there might be some minor differences in pronunciation due to regional accents or individual variations, from a linguistic perspective, we consider them identical for this purpose. Therefore, my response remains affirmative that the two words start with the same consonant
luchtleidingen, lekzucht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "luchtleidingen" starts with /lk/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme (a voiceless velar plosive followed by a voiced alveolar lateral approximant). Similarly, the second word "lekzucht" also begins with /lk/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
landkrabben, levensdrift, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "landkrabben" and "levensdrift" start with the /l/ consonant sound.Justification: In the word "landkrabben", the letter combination "ld" is pronounced as /l/. Similarly, in the word "levensdrift", the first syllable starts with the letters "lv", which also represents the phoneme /l/, indicating that they share the same initial consonant sound of /l/.<|eot_id|>
wegdruip, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "wegdruip" (which means "to drip away") and "onderden" (a variant of "ondersen", which means "underneath them" or "below them") start with the /w/ and /ndr/ sounds, respectively, but pronounced together as [v] in this case since they come from different linguistic roots. The /n/, being silent before another vowel, does not affect the initial consonantal quality when considering whether
kamferballetje, koepelvormiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "kamfer" (camphor) in "kamferballetje" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of "koepel"-in-"koepelvormiger", starting the word "koepel". The initial sounds match, making them start with the same consonant sound (/k/).<|eot_id|>
liefkozend, landbeer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "liefkozed" (Dutch for "tenderly") and "Landbier" ("country beer", although Landbier is not commonly used in modern Dutch) start with the /l/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed 'L', which represents the voiced alveolar lateral approximant [l] phoneme in Standard Dutch pronunciation. This means that they share the same initial consonantal onset, making them hom
kreupelbossen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "kreupel" starts with the /k/ sound (the letter combination 'kr' is pronounced as /k/, not /tr/) while the second word "aanvijl" also begins with the /aɲʝ/ or sometimes written as "nch", which can be approximated to start with a soft /chn/ sound but has no exact equivalent in English phonetics. However, when compared to other sounds
pareloesters, peetdochters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "parel-oesters" and "peet-dochters" start with the /p/ or "pee" consonant sound.Justification: In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as:* "/ˈparɛ.loʏstərs/" (parel-oesters) = starts with a voiceless alveolar plosive (/p/)* "/pet.doxtər.z/' (peet-d
datje, donderachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "datje" and "donderachtigste" do indeed start with the same consonant sound /d/. The first word starts as "/da-tjɛ/" (pronounced like "tah-yeh") while the second one begins as "/do-nər-acht-iχstə/" (with a slight emphasis on the syllable preceding "-cht"). Both share this initial phoneme of /d/, making them homophonous in terms
mannenhoofd, moutmeel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mannenhoofd" begins with the /m/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "moutmeel". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words share the initial bilabial nasal stop [m] as their first consonantal segment. This similarity suggests that they indeed start with the same consonant sound (/m/) despite being different morphemes (words).<|eot_id|>
jut, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jut" and "ritten" (not exactly "rittmeren", but I assume that's what you meant) do indeed start with the same consonantal /r/ or [ʁ] phoneme.Justification:* In standard Dutch pronunciation, both "jut" and "ritten" have initial sounds represented by the letter combination "rt".* The letters 't' in each word is silent, as this is common in many Germanic languages
zenuwpijn, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "zenuwpijn" starts with the letter combination /zn/, which represents the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by nasalized vowel sounds (n). On the other hand, the second word "vadervreugd'en' begins with the letters "/vd/", where both '/v/' and 'd'' represent voiced labiodental stop ([b]) or bilabial plosive [p]
binnenvaartuigen, bundeltje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "binnenvaartuigen" starts with the /b/ consonant sound.The word "bundeltje" also starts with the /b/ consonant sound.Justification:Both words have the letters 'B' at their beginning, which represents the voiceless bilabial stop phoneme in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation as /p/. The sounds /b/ is one of its realizations depending on language and dialect
bedrijving, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "bedrijving" starts with /b/, which is pronounced as a voiced bilabial stop (the lips come together to make this sound). The word "esthetiek", on the other hand, also begins with /b/. In both cases, there's no difference in how you articulate your mouth when saying them; only the tongue movement changes between vowels or diphthongs after that initial /b/.So, I justified my response by analyzing phon
bedienaars, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "bedienaars" and "nadook" start with the /b/ or /dʒ/ (soft 'g') sounds, which can be considered as similar in many phonetic transcriptions systems. The first word starts with "B", while the second one has a soft "G". However, they share the initial voiced bilabial stop (/b/) or postalveolar affricate (/d͡ʒ/) respectively, making them
ontruimt, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "ontruimt" starts with /n/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "naduien". The justification for this answer lies in the phonetic representation of both words, where "/n/" represents the voiced alveolar nasal stop, making them share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
beschietend, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "beschietend" and "voorrig" start with the /bʃ/ or /vɾ/ sounds, which can be considered as having similar initial consonants despite being different phonetically in some languages (e.g., English). In this case, they share the starting letter combination of "/bs-" for "beschietend", and "/vr-" for "voorrug". This similarity suggests that they do indeed have the same
attentie, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "attentie" and "rotacisme" both start with the letter combination /at/. In phonetics, this is considered to have the same initial consonantal sound as English words like "attack", which also starts with /tʃən(t)/ or [æt]. This means that despite being different letters (a Latin 'c' in rotacisme vs no c at all in attentie), they share the same starting consonance
boerenscholen, buffers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "boerenscholen" and "buffers" start with the /b/ sound.Justification:The first word is of Germanic origin (Dutch) and starts with the letter combination "Boe", which represents the phoneme /beːr/. The second word comes from English and also begins with the letters "Bu". Although they come from different languages, their initial sounds have been preserved in translation or borrowing, resulting in identical starting points for both words: the
ingestorte, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "ingestorde" starts with /ɪŋ/, which is pronounced as "in-g". Meanwhile, the second word "statica" begins with /st/. Although they don't share identical letters (/n/ vs. /s/), both sounds start with a voiced or unvoiced stop-consonantal cluster (NG- and ST-) that can be considered equivalent in terms of phonetics. Therefore, I conclude that these two Dutch words
liefkozend, lerarende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "liefkozend" and "-lerarende" start with the letter combination "/l/", which represents the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (or sometimes referred to as /ʟ/) in phonetics.Justification:* The first word is spelled L-I-E-F-K-O-Z-E-N-D.The initial letters of this word can be broken down into individual sounds: /liːf.ko.zɛn.d/. As we see here
rotacisme, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "rotacisme" and "aanvijl" start with the /r/ or /ɾʷ/ (alveolar trill) sound, which is considered as a single consonantal phoneme in many languages including Dutch. This means that they share the initial consonant sound (/r/) despite being different morphemes with distinct meanings ("rotationism" vs. "awl"). The presence of this shared sound indicates that both words belong to the same
heksenbezem, hangoortafels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "heksenbezem" starts with /h/, which is also the beginning of the second word "hangoortafels". Both words have the same initial consonantal phoneme, which in this case is /h/.<|eot_id|>
lucifersmerken, landkrabben, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "lucifersmerken" and "landkrabben" start with the letter combination /l/. This is because in many languages including English, when two or more letters appear together at the beginning of a word, their sounds can combine to form a single phoneme (unit of sound). In this case, both words have the distinctively different consonantal sounds /luː/, /sɛrəkʰn̩
hoevende, hongerlappen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "hoe" in "hoevende" (pronounced as /hʊˈve̝ndə/) and "hong-" in "hongerlappen" (/ɦoŋərˈlɑpən) start with the voiceless labiodental fricative /h/. This means they share the initial consonantal sound, which I've identified above.<|eot_id|>
zouterijen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "zouterijen" starts with the letter combination "zw", which represents the /tsʊr/ or /zuːtrɛi̯ən/ sounds, whereas the second word "ontroomt" begins with the letters "on". Although they don't share identical starting phonemes (/k/, for instance), both words start with different but distinct speech segments that can be categorized under the broad category of consonants in lingu
Jut, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "jut" (in English) and "versmallen" (Dutch word for 'to diminish' or 'to reduce') start with /v/, which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative in both languages.Justification: The letter combination "Jt-" can be transcribed to its corresponding phonetic value of /dʒɪt/. However, since we're comparing two separate language's pronunciation patterns, I'm focusing on their individual
jatte, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "jatte" starts with the /ʤ/ (or sometimes written as /d͡z/) sound, which is commonly referred to as the "soft g" or "dg". The second part of the compound noun "regimentscommandant" begins with the letter combination "r-g", but in this case, both letters together produce the /ɣ/ sound, often transcribed as "/x/" due to its similar pronunciation. Although not
zouterijen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "z" in "zouterijen" and "v" in "invul" represent distinct sounds, but they start their respective syllables as /ʒuːtərɛi̯n/ (zo-uter-ejen) and /invuyl/. The initial letters of each word do not share similar phonetic characteristics to form identical or close enough consonantal starts for them to be considered starting from the same consonant sound
rotacisme, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "rotacisme" starts with the /r/ sound, which is a voiceless alveolar trill in this case (a common pronunciation of 'r' in many languages). The second word "ontduik" also begins with the /n/ or sometimes pronounced as /nt/, but still has no relation to the initial sounds we focus on here. We only consider distinct phonemes for our purpose; therefore, focusing solely on distinctive features like
detacheer, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "detacheer" and "ingestort" start with the /dʈ/ or "dtch" sound.Justification:In standard Dutch pronunciation, the combination of letters "tch" is typically pronounced as [dʈ] (a voiceless alveolar stop followed by a palatal approximant). Therefore, despite their different meanings ("detacheer" means to detach, while "ingestort" can mean something has been poured in), they
duif, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "duif" (meaning dove) and "verlichtten" (a verb meaning to illuminate or light up) both start with the /dʋ/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced dental fricative in Standard Dutch pronunciation. The initial sounds of each word share this similar phonetic characteristic, making them homophonous for native speakers who speak Dutch natively.<|eot_id|>
extraherend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "extraherend" and "indeuk" start with different letters, but their initial sounds /eks-/, /ɪn-/ respectively can both be transcribed as [k]. This is because in English phonetics, /ks/ cluster followed by vowel usually devoices to become [k] (e.g., kiss -> kit). Similarly, the Dutch letter combination 'dx' often represents a voiceless velar stop [k], like in
zondagcompetities, zandtrein, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zondag" and "zand" start with the /z/ consonant sound.Justification: The letters 'Z' in both words represent the voiced alveolar fricative phoneme (/z/) which is a common feature of many languages including English and Dutch. This means that when we pronounce them together or separately, they share this initial consonantal quality making their beginning sounds identical. In linguistics, such matching patterns between two speech segments at the onset (
trompetboom, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "trompet" starts with the /tr/ consonant sound (a voiceless trill), which is also present at the beginning of the second word "radende". Although there's no exact repetition in letters ("r", not "t"), both sounds share the common feature that their production involves the tongue being positioned near or behind the alveolar ridge, making them part of the similar coronal stop category (/t/, /d
voedingssupplementen, valbuis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "voedingssupplementen" starts with the letter combination "v", which is pronounced as /f/. Similarly, the second word "valbuis" also begins with the letter "v". Since both letters have the same pronunciation (/f/) despite being written differently (in this case, due to language-specific spelling conventions), we can conclude that they start with the same consonant sound. In phonetics, this would be represented by the symbol /
welbedachte, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wel" in "welbedachte" and "zeneuw-" in "zenuwpijn" start with /zw/. This is because "wel" has undergone assimilation to become [ʁ] (a guttural approximant) before the voiceless alveolar fricative /f/, which then becomes voiced when preceding another vowel or semivowel; meanwhile, "zen"- starts as /tsɛn-/, but due to linguistic
zenuwpijn, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zenuw" begins with /z/, which is also the starting point of the second word, "trek". The sounds /z/ and /tʁɛknɛt/ (the actual pronunciation) share similar characteristics as both start with a voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) or its equivalent in this case being approximated to /ts/. Although not identical phonetically, they can still be considered having the same general consonantal
doorstuur, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "door" in "doorstuur" (meaning 'to steer' or 'to navigate') and "donk-" in "donkerden" (the verb form of "donder", meaning 'thunder') start with the /dr-/) consonant cluster, which represents the same initial phoneme (/ðr-/). In linguistics, this is referred to as a homorganic onset, where two sounds share similar articulatory features at their beginning
barkelners, bundeltje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "barkelners" and "bondeltje" start with the letter combination /br/. In phonetics, this is known as a voiceless bilabial fricative followed by a voiced labiodental approximant.Justification:* The first word "BARKELNERS" starts with the sequence of sounds /BR/.	+ "/B/" represents a voiceless bilabial stop.    + "/R/" represents a trill (which can
doemdenker, doffertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "doem" in "doemdenker" (meaning "dramatist") and "dof-" in "doffertjes" (a type of pastry) start with the /dɔf/ or /duːf/ sounds, which can be considered as having the same consonant sound (/ð/). The difference lies only in their vowel combinations following the initial consonantal sequence. This similarity justifies my affirmative response to
joysticks, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "joystick", starts with the /j/ sound (a voiced postalveolar affricate), which is represented by the letter combination "js".The second word, "vadervreugde" (Dutch for 'father's joy'), begins with the /f/ or /v/ sounds (both labiodental fricatives), depending on how you pronounce the digraph "vd". However, in both cases, they do not match the /
vaarstokken, vuistregel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "vaarstokken" starts with /v/, which is also the initial consonantal phoneme of the second word "vuistregel". Both words share the beginning sounds, making them identical in terms of their starting consonants.<|eot_id|>
welbedachte, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "welbe" in "welbedacht(e)" starts with /w/, while the first part of "voor-" in "voorlief" also begins with /v/. Although they differ phonetically, both sounds belong to the category of voiceless labiovelar approximants (/ʋ/) or bilabial fricatives (in some accents), which can be considered as similar due to their shared place and manner of articulation within the human vocal tract
zenuwpijn, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zenuwpijn" starts with the /z/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "navoelen". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words share the initial consonantal segment "/zn/" or more specifically, they start with the voiced alveolar fricative (z) followed by nasal ("n"). This similarity justifies my affirmative reply to your question.<|eot_id|>
vinkers, voorraadschuren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "vinkers" and "voorraadschuren" start with the letter combination "/v/" which represents the voiced labiodental fricative /f/. This is because in Dutch language, when writing down foreign names or loanwords that contain sounds not present in native Dutch vocabulary (like English's /kʃ/, for instance), they often adapt them to fit their own phonological system.In this case, since we're dealing solely with Germanic languages here,
sinus, solovluchten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "sinus" and "solovluchten" both start with the /s/ sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed "S", which represents the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) in phonetics. This means that they share the same initial consonantal segment or onset, making them homonymous for their beginning sounds.<|eot_id|>
duif, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "duif" starts with the /d/ sound, which is also present in the second word "zetterijen". Although they have different letters (u vs z), their sounds can both be represented by the phoneme /dz/. This means that although not exactly identical, they share the same initial consonantal quality, making them similar enough to consider starting with the same consonant sound (/d/) when comparing the two words.<|eot_id|>
wispelstaartende, wijngaardluis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "wispelstaartende" starts with /ws/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme in English (the combination of /w/ and /s/) or similar to German's'sch' sounds (/ʃ/).Similarly, the second word "wijngaardluis" also begins with /wj/. Although not directly identical, both share the initial /w- or /vj-sound sequence that resembles each other closely enough to consider
samengesmolten, serredeur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "samengesmolten" starts with /s/, which is also the starting letter of "/ser-", in the second word "serieur". Although they have different letters, their sounds can be transcribed to /zr-/. In phonetics, both /s/ and /zr/ represent voiceless alveolar fricatives or approximants, making them equivalent for this purpose. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words
maatkan, mekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "maat" starts with /m/, which is also the beginning of the second word "mek". Therefore, both words share the same initial consonant sound, which is /m/.<|eot_id|>
nadook, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "nadook" starts with /n/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "sciopticons". Both start with the nasal consonantal phoneme /n/. This means that, in terms of their initial sounds, both words share this common characteristic. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that they do indeed begin with the same consonant sound (/n/)!<|eot_id|>
countryrock, kemelsgaren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "countryrock" starts with /k/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "kemelsgaren". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics, where we compare the initial sounds or phones (/) to determine if they share similar characteristics (place, manner, voicing). In both cases, the phone /k/ represents a voiceless velar stop consonantal sound, making them identical from that perspective.<|eot_id|>
doelvlak, doortrapt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "doelvlak" and "doortrap't" start with the /dɔu̯-trəpʰt/ combination of sounds.Justification: In the first word "doelvlak", we have "/duːl.vlak/" where "/du:/ is pronounced like 'due' in English, followed by '/v/' (the voiced labiodental fricative) which then leads to '/lak/', meaning that the initial
joysticks, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "joystick", starts with /j/, which is pronounced like a voiced postalveolar affricate [dʒ]. Similarly, in the second word "gemest", the starting letter combination "-ge-" represents the voiceless velar fricative /x/. Although they don't share identical letters ("g" vs "/"), both sounds can be represented by the broad transcription of English as /kʃ/ or /tʃ/,
reddingstoestellen, rondbazuinende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "reddings-toestellen" starts with the /r/ consonant sound, which is also present in the second word "ront-bazuinende", starting from "/b/" (which becomes /br/) when combined as one syllable due to phonetic rules of the language. Although not identical (/r/ vs./br/,), both start with sounds that belong to the alveolar or bilabial stops category, making them similar enough to
regelingen, rijpaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "regelen" is not present in either of the two given words, but we can analyze each individual part to determine if they start with the same consonant sound or not:* Regelingen starts with the letter combination "Rg", which represents the /rʤ/ (or sometimes written as /rd͡ʒ/) phoneme.* Rijpaard starts with the letters "Rj", where "J" makes no significant contribution
kielvlak, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "kielvlak" and "sciopticons" start with the /k/ or hard c sound, which is considered as one of the most common ways to write this phoneme in English (the other being 'c'). This means that both words have similar initial sounds despite their different spellings due to language-specific conventions such as capitalization rules for prefixes like scio- from Greek roots.<|eot_id|>
ingestort, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ingestort" and "voorraad" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative consonant sound.Justification:Ingestort starts with the letter combination "in-", which is pronounced as a single phoneme (/ɪn/) in Modern Standard Dutch. The following letters "-ges-" also contribute to this initial vowel-consonant sequence being pronounced without any interruption by another consonantal sound before the final -t-. Therefore, we can
jut, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "jut" starts with /dʒ/, which is pronounced like a soft 'ch' or a gentle 'g', while the second word "toerekenstellingen" begins with /t/. Although both letters appear to start with different sounds (/dʝ/ vs /t/) in written form, when spoken aloud, the initial consonantal cluster of "jut" (the digraph combination "/jt/") actually produces
dubbelsprongen, datje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dubbelsprongen" starts with the /d/ sound, which is a voiced dental stop in IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) notation as [d]. The second word "datje" also begins with this exact same consonantal sound (/d/) or more precisely [t] because of its assimilation to preceding voiceless sounds before vowels. So, both words start with the identical initial phoneme ([d]/[t]), making them share the same conson
joysticks, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "joystick" begins with /j/, which is pronounced like a soft y or j, while the second word "liefdesgevoelens" starts with /l/. Although they may appear to have different letters at face value ("j" vs "L"), in phonetics, both sounds can be represented by the /lj/ combination, where the initial /l/ is silent (a phenomenon known as voiceless alveolar lateral approxim
loopgravenstelling, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "loopgravenstelling" starts with the /l/ sound (a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant), which is represented by the letter combination "lp".The second word "zenuwpijn" also begins with the /l/ or sometimes pronounced as /ʒ/ sound (voiced postalveolar fricative) in this case, but for simplicity's sake, we can consider both sounds to start with the similar
zenuwpijn, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zenuwpijn" starts with the letter combination /zn/, which begins with the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by the nasal stop (/n/).On the other hand, the word "hartzwarte" also starts with the letters "/hz/", where both sounds belong to the voiced interdental fricatives (/[ð]/). Although they don't share exactly the same phoneme or place of articulation, they do
huurcompensaties, hartsvriendinnen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "huurcompensaties" starts with the /h/ sound (a voiceless glottal fricative), while the second word "hartsvriendinnen" also begins with the /h/ sound in its prefix "/hart-". Although there might be slight variations due to phonetic nuances or regional accents, both words share the initial consonantal sound of /h/.<|eot_id|>
lieveling, levenswerkelijkheid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "lieveling" begins with /l/, which is also present in the second word "levenswerkelijkheid". The difference lies only in their vowel sounds, not in the initial consonantal phoneme (/l/) or its place of articulation (alveolar). Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound "/l/", justifying my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
narcoanalyse, nanoseconde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "narcoanalyse" starts with the /n/ consonant sound, which is also present in the second word "nanoseconde". Both words share this initial nasal stop consonantal phoneme (/n/) as their starting point, making them identical for that aspect of pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
regio's, rijksacademien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "regio" begins with the /r/ sound (a voiceless alveolar trill), while the word "rijksscholen"-specifically-"Rijksakademie", starts also with this very same consonantal phoneme (/r/) as well. In both cases, we see that there is no difference in their initial sounds; henceforth, I conclude affirmatively: yes! The two phrases indeed start with identical beginning consonants
pittiger, pand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "pittiger" starts with the /pt/ consonant digraph, which represents the voiceless stop /tʰ followed by the bilabial trill /r/. The word "pand", on the other hand, also begins with the letter combination /pd/, where again we have the voiced dental stop /d/ followed by the labiodental fricative /f/.Although they don't share exactly the same letters (/pt/ vs. /pd
gekaaide, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "gekaaide" begins with the /g/ sound, which is also present in the second word "zenuwpijn". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiced velar stop consonantal sound [ɡ]. This similarity can help identify patterns or relationships between linguistic elements like prefixes, roots, or suffixes within language structures such as morphology and orthography (the study of written forms). In essence, yes,
attentie, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "attentie" and "toerekent" start with the /t/ consonant sound.Justification: In linguistics, phonology is concerned with the sounds of language, including their distribution in morphemes (smallest units of meaning) such as prefixes, roots, suffixes etc., like here - 'atten', '-te-', '-re-'- all starting with T which makes them share similar initial Consonantal Sound.<|eot_id|>
jut, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "jut" begins with /dʒ/, which is pronounced as a soft ch or dg, while the second word starts with "/v", a voiced labiodental fricative (the 'b' in "vet"). Although they don't share identical letters (/j/ vs /v/), their sounds can be considered similar due to being both voiceless stops followed by different vowels ('u', 'a'). The similarity lies in that all three phonemes involve
loonde, levensdrift, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "loonde" and "levensdrift" start with the /l/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "loonde" starts with the letter combination "LO", which is pronounced as /luːndə/, where "/u/" represents the vowel sound in "put".* Similarly, the word "levensdrift" also begins with the letters "LE", which is pronounced as /leɪvənzdʁaft/,
foutslag, filmrechten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "fout" starts with /f/, which is also present in the second word "film", making them share the same initial consonantal phoneme, namely /f/.<|eot_id|>
extraherend, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "extraherend" starts with the letter combination /ks/, which represents the voiceless alveolar fricative followed by the voiced postalveolar affricate, both of which can be represented as the single phoneme /kʃ/. On the other hand, the second word "trompetboom" begins with the letters "/tr/", representing two distinct sounds: the voiceless dental stop /t̪r/.Although they do not share
voorlig, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "voor" starts with /v/, which is also the starting letter of "/st/" in the second word "statika". Although not identical letters (/v/ vs./s/), both sounds represent similar voiceless labiodental fricatives (the air flowing between pursed lips). This similarity can lead to confusion or association when pronouncing them together as you did ("voorstatica"). Therefore, I consider their beginning consonantsounds
nippel, nederiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "nippel" starts with /n/, which is also the beginning of "/ndr-" in the second word, "nederiger". The two sounds are identical: both start with the voiced alveolar nasal stop phoneme (/n/) followed by another sound (a vowel or other consonants). Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
wedergaf, welpenleidster, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "wedergaf" begins with the /w/ sound (a voiceless labiovelar approximant), while the word "welpenleidster" also starts with the /w/ sound. Both sounds share the initial letter combination "/w/" which indicates that both words start with the same consonant sound (/w/).<|eot_id|>
planimetreer, beschietend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "planimeteren" begins with the /p/ sound, which is a voiceless bilabial plosive in phonetics (IPA: [plɑˈnimətʰeːrən]). The word "beschieten", on the other hand, starts with the /b/ sound, which is also a voiced labiovelar stop (IPA: [/b]).Although they don't share exactly the same letter at the
tensie, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "tensie" and "duif" start with the /d/ consonant sound.Justification: In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows:* "Tensie": [ˈtɛnsi]* "Duif": [dyf]As we see from their transcription in IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), both words share the starting point "/d/" which represents a voiced dental stop or a soft 'th
vochtende, voorraadschuren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "vochtende" and "voorraadschuren" start with the /v/ consonant sound.Justification: In the first word, "vochtende", the combination of letters "vc" forms a single phoneme (unit of sound) which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative (/v/) followed by a silent letter ("c"). Similarly, in the second word, "voorraadschuren", the sequence starts with two identical vowels
planimetreer, welhebbende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "planimetree" starts with the /p/ sound, which is also present in the second word "welhebbend", as both start with the letter combination "/pl/" followed by other letters. The sounds of "p" and "l" blend together to form this single consonantal phoneme (/pl/) at the beginning of each word. Therefore, I conclude that they share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
quintolen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "quintollen" and "-aanvijlen" both start with the /k/ or /q/ sounds, which is considered to have the same phonetic quality in linguistics (the voiceless velar stop). This means that they share the same initial consonantal sound despite having different vowels following them.<|eot_id|>
onderligger, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "onderligger" starts with the /n/ or nasal stop consonant sound, whereas the second word "zenuwpyn" also begins with this very same consonant sound /n/. This is because both words have the letters 'N' as their starting letter in Dutch language. Justification: The justification for my yes-answer lies in comparing the phonetic transcription of each word's beginning sounds to identify whether there exists any similarity between them.
planimetreer, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "planimetrie" (the correct spelling) and tachism start with the /p/ or /pl/ sounds in Dutch language. The prefix "pla-" is audible at the beginning of both words, which indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/pl/) or allophone (/p/). This similarity can help identify them as starting with similar consonants despite having different meanings.<|eot_id|>
ralreigers, roep, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "ralreigers" and "-roep" both start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification:* The first word is spelled as "ral-rei-gers", which starts with the letter combination "R-A-L".* In phonetics, this would correspond to the voiceless alveolar trill [r] followed by the vowel sounds in between.* Similarly, the second part of the phrase "-roep" begins with the letters
roosterkozijn, roerhardere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "roost" starts with the /r/ sound, which is also present in the second word "roe". This indicates that both words start with the same consonantal phoneme (/r/) or more specifically, the voiceless alveolar trill [r]. Therefore, they share similar initial sounds despite having different meanings and spellings.<|eot_id|>
handicaprace, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "handicap" and "aanvijl" start with the /h/ or hard c sound.Justification:The word "handicap" starts with the letter combination "H-A-N", which is pronounced as /hændɪkæp/. On the other hand, the word "aanvijl" begins with the letters "A-A-N-V-I-J-L", but the first two letters ("AA") in this case represent the single phoneme /
meekrijgt, morsende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "meekrijgt" and "morsende" start with the /m/ sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed "M", which represents the voiced bilabial nasal stop phoneme in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation as "/m/. This indicates that they share the same initial consonantal onset, specifically the /m/ sound.<|eot_id|>
lijkende, levenswerkelijkheid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "lijkende" and "levenswerkelijkheid" both start with the /l/ consonant sound, which is what I mean by saying they share the same initial consonant sound. The first letter in each word is pronounced as /l/, making them phonetically identical at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
Jut, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "jutt" (which is not a common word, but I assume you meant to type "juist", meaning "right") and "trompetboom" both start with the /kʃ/ or /ksch/ sound in their pronunciation. The first letter of each word is indeed similar, being either 'J' and 'T', respectively, which correspond phonetically to the sounds mentioned above. Therefore, my response is justified as YES.<|eot_id|>
jut, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "jut" starts with /dʒ/, which is the voiced postalveolar affricate, while the second part "-zetter-" begins with /z/. Although they don't share exactly the same letter (/dʒ/ vs /z/), both sounds start with a voiceless or partially voiced alveolar stop (the initial consonantal quality of 't' in English). In phonetics, this can be considered as starting with
lijkende, leugenachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "lijkende" and "leugenachtigste" do indeed start with the same consonant sound.Justification:* The word "lijkende" starts with the combination of sounds /l/, which is represented by the letter pair "lj".* Similarly, the word "leugenachtigste" also begins with the combination of sounds /l/, again represented by the letters "lg".Since both words share this identical initial consonantal sequence (/l/),
duivelsklauwen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "duivelsklauwen" starts with /d/, which is also the first consonantal phoneme in the phrase "-ont-room-t", making them share the same initial consonant sound (/d/) despite being two separate words.<|eot_id|>
vuurwerkers, vezelvlies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "vuurwerkers" starts with the /v/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative (the "w" in English). Similarly, the second word "vezelvlies" also begins with the /v/ sound, indicating that both words start with the same consonant sound (/v/).<|eot_id|>
versvoeten, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "vers" in "versvoeten" and "indeuK" (which is likely meant as "indruk") start with /v/, which justifies my affirmative response.The justification for this conclusion lies in phonetics: The letter combination 'vs' or 'vr' typically represents the voiceless labiodental fricative (/f/) sound followed by a voiced alveolar stop ([d]) when pronounced separately; however, together they form a single speech segment that
jut, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "jut" starts with /dʒ/, which is pronounced as a voiced postalveolar affricate, whereas the second word "indeuk" begins with /n/. Although they don't share exactly the same letter (the letters 'j' and 'i'), their sounds in phonetics differ significantly (/dʒ/ vs /n/). Therefore, I conclude that no, both words do not start with the same consonant sound.
zuiplappen, zandtrein, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "zuiplappen" starts with /zw/, which is pronounced as a single consonantal cluster, while the second word "zandtrein" also begins with /zd/. Although they both start with 'Z', their initial sounds differ in that "/zw/" has a more complex articulation compared to plain '/d/'. However, from a phonological perspective, we can consider them starting with similar consonant sounds (/z/) since they share the identical beginning letter ('
wegkijk, watertanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "weg" starts with /v/, which is also the starting point of the second word's prefix "/w". Although they have different meanings, their initial sounds share the similar phonetic characteristic as both start with the voiceless labiodental fricative approximant [v] or close to that in this case (as some languages pronounce them slightly differently). This makes them belong to the same category when considering consonant sounds at the beginning.<|eot_id|>
versvoeten, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "versvoeten" begins with the /v/ sound (a voiced labiodental fricative), which is also present at the start of the second word "esthetic". The justification for this conclusion lies in phonetics: both words share the identical initial consonantal segment (/v/) despite their different meanings and etymology. This similarity can help us recognize patterns or connections between seemingly unrelated linguistic elements like we see here within the context of comparing two Dutch words.
lafste, lege, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "lafste" starts with the letter combination /lf/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme (a distinct unit of sound) in many languages including English. Similarly, the second word "leger" also begins with this exact same sound (/LF/) when spoken aloud. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the /L/ followed by the voiceless fricative /F
weergeving, waag, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "weergeving" starts with the /w/ sound (which is pronounced like a soft English 'v' or 'u'), while the second word "waag" also begins with this exact same /w/ sound. Therefore, both words start with the identical consonant sound of /w/.<|eot_id|>
doelvlak, dichtmaken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "doelvlak" and "dichtmaken" start with the letter combination /dt/. This is because in Dutch language, when two or more letters appear together at the beginning of a word without any intervening vowels (a phenomenon known as digraph), they can represent one distinct phoneme.In this case, "/dt/" represents the voiceless alveolar stop followed by a dental fricative (/t͡sʰ/, which sounds like 'ts')
avondfeesten, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "avondfeesten", starts with /v/, which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative (the "v" or "f" sound). Similarly, the second word, "-esthetiek", also begins with the letter combination "/e-s-t-", but in this case, the letters "s" and "t" together form a voiceless alveolar stop followed by a dental nasal fricative (/st/)
koffieprijzen, kamferballetje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "koffieprijzen" and "kamferballetje" start with the letter K.Justification: In linguistics, phonetically similar sounds can refer to different letters or digraphs that produce identical pronunciation when spoken together in a word. The initial /K/ sound is present at the beginning of each word due to their shared starting letter 'K'. This similarity indicates they share the same consonantal onset. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two
kuitharing, kousenkoper, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kuitharing" and "kousenkoper" start with the letter combination "/kv/" which represents the voiceless labiovelar plosive followed by the voiced velar nasal in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). This means they share the same initial consonantal phoneme.Justification:* The word "kuitharing" is pronounced as /ˈkytaːrɪŋ/, where the first syllable starts with /kv/.*
kappersaus, kinkhoren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kappers" and "kinkhoren" start with the /k/ consonant sound.Justification: In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows:* "Kappers": [k]* "Kinkhoren": also starts with [k]In this case, we have identical starting points for both words in terms of their consonantal sounds (/k/) and therefore share the same consonant sound at the beginning.<|eot_id|>
bedrijving, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "bedrijf" (the root of "bedrijving") starts with /b/, while both "es-" in "esthetic-a" start with /s/. Although they may look different, their sounds do not match exactly due to differences between English phonetics (/tʃ/) and IPA notation used for international languages like Latin-based ones where there's no direct equivalent for some letters or diphthongs). Still, considering only pure letter combinations without any linguistic
tochtkanaal, tinteloogt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "tocht" begins with /tʰ/, which is pronounced as a voiceless dental stop, while the word "tinteloogt" also starts with /t/. Both sounds share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/t/) despite having different diacritical marks (h for the first one). The pronunciation of both words would involve blowing air through pursed lips to produce this similar but not identical beginning sound in each case.<|eot_id|>
treknet, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "trek" and "indok"-en (note: "-en" is not part of the word) start with /t/. Justification:1. The first letter in each word is 'T'.2. Both letters ('T' and 'd') have similar sounds when pronounced.Since they share the initial consonantal phoneme (/t/) or voiceless alveolar stop, I conclude that yes, indeed, these Dutch words do begin with the same conson
planimetreer, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "planimetreer" and "ontduiken" start with the /p/ or /ntdʋiːkən/ sounds.Justification:* The word "planimetreer" starts with the letter combination "pl", which is pronounced as /plaɪmɛtˈreːr/, where we can see that the first phoneme (sound) is indeed /ple/.* Similarly, the word "ontdu
ontruimt, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ontruimt" and "statica" start with the /s/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "ontruimt" begins with the letters "o-n-t", but in Dutch pronunciation, the combination of sounds is often reduced to a single phoneme (/nt/) which starts with a voiceless alveolar fricative (represented by the letter "s").* Similarly, the word "statica" also starts with the letters "
onderligger, attentie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "onderligger" starts with /n/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "attentie". Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal sound (/n/).<|eot_id|>
maatregel, mentrix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "maatregel" starts with /m/, which is also the beginning of the second word "mentorix". Both have the initial consonantal phoneme /m/. Therefore, my response to this question is affirmative - yes, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically "/m/" in this case.<|eot_id|>
marktdagen, managersfuncties, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "markten", "dagen", "managers" all start with the /m/ or "em" phoneme.Justification:The first word is "markt-dagen". The prefix "markt-" starts with the letter combination of "mrk-". Similarly, in both "dag-en" (days) and "manager-s", we can see that they also start with the letters "dg-" which when pronounced together produce the /m/ sound. Therefore
haaks, hangoortafels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "haaks" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, while the second word "hangoroetafels" also starts with the /h/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
boerenscholen, bontstola's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "boerenscholen" starts with the /b/ sound, which is a voiceless bilabial stop (a soft p-like sound). The second word "bontstola'" also begins with this exact same sound "/b/", maintaining its initial position as a voiced labiodental fricative in both cases.Justification: Both words start with the letter 'B', indicating that they share the identical beginning consonantal phoneme (/b/) despite having different
dichtmaken, dassenhanger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "dichtmaken" starts with the /dʰ/ (or dental) sound, which is pronounced as "dt". The second word "dasßenhangér" also begins with this same /dʰ/ or "dt" sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/d/) despite having different vowel sounds following them.<|eot_id|>
vrijheidsklasse, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "vrijheid" starts with the /f/ sound, which is pronounced as [vf]. Similarly, the second word "ontruimt" also begins with the /ntr- sounds that can be reduced to approximately [nf] or [nt], but in this case, I assume you're referring specifically to the initial phoneme being similar, i.e., both starting with a voiceless labiodental fricative (the 'f'
joysticks, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "joysticks" (English) and "bediendaars" (Dutch) start with the /j/ or soft-g consonant sound.Justification: In English, the word "joysticks" begins with the letter combination "joy-", which is pronounced as /dʒoɪstɪks/. The first phoneme (/dj/) starts with a voiced postalveolar affricate [d͡ʒ], often represented by the dig
regelingen, reddingstoestellen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "regelen" starts with the /r/ sound, which is also present in the second word "reddings-toestellen". Although there's some variation due to prefixes (re-), suffixes (-ingen/-toestellen) and compound words involved, both original roots ("regel-" and "-red") share the initial consonantal phoneme "/r/", making them start with the same consonant sound (/r/.).<|eot_id|>
loopgravenstellingen, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "loop" starts with /l/, which is also present at the beginning of each subsequent word ("loog", "detach-"). Therefore, all four words start with the same consonant sound "/l/" or more specifically, the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant phoneme in this case.<|eot_id|>
toerekent, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "toerekent" starts with /t/, while the word "nadook" also begins with /n/. However, in Dutch phonology, both sounds can develop into different pronunciations when followed by certain vowels or diphthongs. In this case, after careful examination of their pronunciation rules, I found that /t/ and /d/ (the voiced counterpart) often become similar [ð] before front vowel combinations like -e
framepjes, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "framepjes" starts with the /f/ sound (a voiceless labiodental fricative), which is represented by the letters "fr".The second word "ontruimt" also begins with the /ntr- sounds (which can be transcribed as [ˈɑntʁuym̩] in IPA). Although this may seem like different consonants at first glance, when pronouncing both words together naturally
nadook, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "nadok" (in "nadoek") and "tac-" in "tachisme" start with the /ndʒ/ or /d͡z/ sounds.Justification:In Dutch language, "nadok" is actually not a word; I assume you meant to type "na-doek", which means "cloth". In this case, the first letter combination starts as "/nda/".On the other hand, "tachisme" begins with the
regelingen, rennersveld, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "regelingen" and "rennersveld" start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification: In linguistics, phonetically similar sounds can refer to different letters or combinations of letters that produce the same auditory effect when pronounced correctly by native speakers. The initial letter in each word is written as 'R', which corresponds to the voiceless alveolar trill [ʁ] (a retroflex approximant) in Standard European Dutch pronunciation. This
afgrijzenwekkendere, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "afgrijzend" starts with /f/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "ontruimen", specifically, both start with the voiceless labiodental fricative /f/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
piepjongst, veranderingsmogelijkheden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "piep" starts with the /p/ sound, which is also present in all subsequent words ("jong", "verand-", "-erings-"). Therefore, despite some letters being different (e.g., "j" vs. "v"), the initial consonantal sounds of each word share similarity as /p/.<|eot_id|>
lijkende, liefkozend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "liijkende" starts with the /l/ sound (the voiced alveolar lateral approximant), while the word "liefkozend" also begins with the /l/ sound. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
vaderschapsverlof, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "vaderschapsverlof" starts with the letter combination "vd", which represents the /vf/ or /vh/ sounds, whereas the second word "esthetiek" begins with the letters "es". Although they don't have exactly identical starting consonants (e.g., 'd' vs.'s'), both start with voiced stops (/b/, /d/) followed by fricatives (/f/, /h/). This similarity
Jut, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "jut" and "-uitrokend" start with different sounds, but they both contain the letter combination "/t/" which represents the voiceless alveolar stop /tʰ/. This is because in many languages including English and Dutch, the letters "J", "T", or their combinations can represent similar phonetic values (the exact pronunciation may vary depending on language-specific rules). In this case, we consider them as having the same consonantal beginning due
Jut, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "Jut" starts with the /dʒ/ (j) sound, which is a voiceless postalveolar affricate in English phonetics. Similarly, the second word "radende" also begins with the /r/ sound, which represents a voiced alveolar trill in this case. Since both sounds start with different parts of speech (/t/, /k/) or manner-of-articulation (/plosive vs./tr
roerhardere, rondschreeuwend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "roerharde" (meaning 'rough' or 'coarse') and "rondschreeuwend" ('roundly screaming' or'shouting around') both start with the /r/ consonant sound, which is pronounced similarly in each word. The difference lies only in their vowel sounds following the initial consonantal phoneme (/ɾoʊərhArDe/) vs./rɔntʃˈsxre�
leugenachtigste, levensverandering, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "leugenachtigste" starts with the letter combination /lɛˈʋeŋaxtɪçstə/, which begins with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant /л/. Meanwhile, the second word "levensverandering" commences with the letters /lɛi̯vənzvrændərɪŋə/, also starting with the voiced
luchtleidingen, lessende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "l" in "Luchtleidingen-" and "lessende" start with the /l/ consonant phoneme, which indicates they share the same initial consonant sound. In linguistics, this phenomenon is called homorganicity or identical onsets, where two sounds have similar articulations at their onset (beginning). The presence of the same consonantal features (/p/, /t/, /k/) preceding different vowels doesn't affect the identity
detacheer, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "detacheer" starts with /d/, which is also present in the second word "toereikend". The justification for this conclusion comes from phonetics: both words have the initial sounds of voiceless dental fricative (/t/) followed by other segments (the rest of each word). This means that despite having different meanings or functions within sentences, their beginning letters share identical pronunciation. Therefore, I conclude affirmatively that yes, these two Dutch
meridionaal, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "meridionaal" starts with the letter combination "/mɛr-/", which represents the /mr/ or trilled-r sound, whereas the second word "ingestort" begins with the letters "/iŋ-", followed by the sounds "/g/" and finally "/strt", all of them representing different phonemes (units of sound). Despite this difference in pronunciation, both words start with distinct but non-similar consonantal segments (/
doopheffer, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "doophage" (I assume you meant to type) and "donkeren" start with the /d/ consonant sound.Justification: In the standard pronunciation of Dutch, the letter combination "ph" is usually pronounced as /f/, but in this case, since there's no vowel following immediately after, we can consider only the first two letters ("do") which clearly indicate that they belong to the voiced dental stop category (/ð/) or sometimes also referred to as
nokte, neerplenzende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "nokte" (meaning "night") and "neerplennzende" (a verb that means "descending, sinking downwards") both start with the /nkʰ/ or /ŋkʰ/ consonant cluster, which is pronounced similarly to English's "ng". This justifies my affirmative response because they share similar initial sounds despite having different meanings in their respective contexts.<|eot_id|>
lekzucht, leemaarde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "lekzucht" starts with /l/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "leemaaard". Both words have the letter combination "/lee/" at their beginning, making them share the same consonant sound (/l/) despite having different meanings ("lekzucht" means 'giggle' or 'chuckle', while "leemmaarde" refers to a type of soil').<|eot_id|>
joysticks, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "joystick" starts with /j/, which is also the beginning of the first syllable in the second phrase "ont-dui-k", where "/n/" can sometimes represent the sounds similar to /dʒ/. Although not exactly identical (/t/) or (θ), both start with soft hissing-like consonants that share similarities. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two phrases indeed initiate their pronunciation from the same general area within the
omsingel, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "omsingel" and "nadoken" both start with the /n/ sound, which is their initial consonantal phoneme. This means that they share the same beginning consonant sound (/n/) in each word.<|eot_id|>
bijstanders, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bijstanders" begins with the /b/ sound, while the word "voorgelieg" (assuming that's what you meant to type) also starts with the /v/ or more precisely /f/, which is often pronounced as /v/ in Dutch due to phonological assimilation rules. Although they don't start exactly alike (/b/ vs./v/) both sounds share similar characteristics of being voiced stops, making them somewhat analogous.<|eot_id|>
Jut, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "toerekennt" both start with the /tʰ/ or th-sound.Justification:In Dutch phonology, the letter combination "tr" is pronounced as [tɦ] (a voiceless dental fricative), which represents the retroflexion of the tongue towards the alveolar ridge. This unique pronunciation distinguishes itself from other languages where this digraph would typically produce a trill-like sound (/r
lacto-vegetarier, leraarden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "lacto-" starts with /l/, which is also present in all three subsequent words: "-veg-e-t-a-r-i-e-r", "-le-ra-ar-d". The presence of this repeating pattern justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
weergeving, waterski's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "weergeving", starts with the /w/ consonant sound (the voiced labiovelar approximant). Similarly, the second word, "waterski'", also begins with the /w/ consonant sound. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, which is /w/.<|eot_id|>
kamerlid, koffietafelde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kamerlid" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the phrase "koffietafeld". The justification for this response lies in the fact that both words share the initial consonantal phoneme "/k/", making them start with the same consonant sound. In linguistics, sounds within speech units like syllables or morphemes can have different properties such as voicing (e.g., voiced/unvoiced), nasalization,
vouwblinden, voorlaatst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "vouw" in "vouwblinden" and "voor" in "voorlaatst" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative phoneme, which represents the same consonant sound. In linguistic terms, this means they share the same place of articulation (labio-dentals), manner of articulation (frictional), and voicing characteristics (/v/) - all essential features for distinguishing one conson
wildspiegels, wolfskuil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "wildspiegels" starts with the /w/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced labiovelar approximant in Standard Dutch pronunciation (IPA: [ʋɪldˈspliɣəlz]). The second word "wolfskuil" also begins with the /w/ sound (pronounced similarly to the first one).Therefore, both words start with the same consonantal phoneme (/w/) or more specifically, share
piepjongst, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "piep" starts with /p/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "weg". The third word does not start with either /w/ or /g/. It actually begins with /dru/.Justification:I analyzed each individual word to identify its initial consonant sounds:1. "Piepjongsweg": Starts with "/pi/" (a combination), but since we're looking at single-consonant-sound comparison,
narcoanalyse, neerplenzende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "narcoanalyse" begins with /n/, which is also the first letter of the second word, "neerplenzende". The justification for this response lies in the fact that both words start with the distinct phoneme /n/. Phonemes are units of speech sounds used to distinguish one word from another in language. In this case, we can see that despite having different meanings and spellings, they share the initial consonantal feature represented by the letters 'N
vaarstokken, voordienen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "vaarstokken" starts with /v/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "voordienen". Both words have the initial letter "V", so they share the same consonant sound, specifically /v/.<|eot_id|>
dichtmaken, doodrijdend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "dichtmaken", starts with /d/, which is represented by the letter combination 'dh'.The second word, "doodrijdend", also begins with /d/.Since both words start with the same consonantal phoneme (/d/) or (the voiced dental stop), they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
dubbelsprongen, doorbladeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "dubbelsprongen" begins with /d/, which is also the starting point of "/door-" in "doordrabeleren". Both have the same initial consonantal phoneme /d/. Justification: The first part of each word has to be broken down into its individual sounds (phonemes). For example:* dub-bel-spring-en* door-blade-renIn both cases, we see that there's a
huidworm, heropvoeding, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "huid" (skin) in "huidworm" and "heren" (men's) in "heropvoeding" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification:* In phonetics, the letter combination "hu-" is typically pronounced as [hyːd] or [hwɪt], which starts with the voiceless glottal fricative stop /h/.* Similarly, when we look at the word "her
jut, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "jut" begins with /dʒ/, which is pronounced as a voiced postalveolar affricate (a soft "dg" or "church") in English phonetics. Meanwhile, the word "schreeuweriger" starts with "/skrē-", where we can identify the sequence of sounds being /s/, /k/, and /r/. Since both sequences start with either no vowel or a silent one (/h/
vuurwerkers, voorhangselen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "vuurwerkers" starts with the /v/ sound (a voiced labiodental fricative), which is represented by the letter combination "vu".Similarly, the word "voorhangselen" also begins with the /v/ sound, again represented by the letters "vor". The remaining sounds in both words ("w", "rks", "hngsl") don't affect their initial consonantal phoneme (/v/) since this
huilerigheid, heropvoeding, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "huilerigheid" starts with the /h/ consonant sound (a voiceless glottal fricative), which is represented by the letter combination "hu".Similarly, the word "heropvoeding" also begins with the /h/ consonant sound, again represented by the letters "he". The rest of each word's spelling follows different sounds or combinations of phonemes; however, their initial segment shares the identical consonantal quality (/
kerstversierselen, kamferballetje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kerstversierselen" and "kamferballetje" start with the /k/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "kerstversierselen" starts with the letter combination "kr", which is pronounced as /kr/, where /r/ is voiced.* Similarly, the word "kamferballetje" also begins with the letters "ka", which is again pronounced as /ka/.* In each case, we have
liefkozend, landbouwarbeidswetten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "liefkozend" starts with /l/, which is also the beginning of "/l/" in the second word "landbouwwarbeidswetten". Both words have the letter combination "-lf-" or "-ld-", making them share the same starting consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
lieveling, levensverandering, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lieveling" starts with the letter combination "/lɪvəliŋ/" which has the /L/ phoneme, while the word "levensveranderende" (note: I assume you meant to type this longer form instead of just "levensveranding") also begins with the letters "/lvnsvrændrənde/", still having the /L/ initial consonantal sound.In both cases, we can see that they share
roofdierachtig, rondbazuinende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "roofdier" and "rondbazuinen-de" start with the letter combination /r/.Justification: The first word is spelled as "roofdier", which starts with the letters R-O-O-F-D-I-E-R, where we can clearly identify that the initial sound begins with the phoneme /R/. Similarly, when examining the second phrase "rondbazuinen-de", we see that it also commences with the sequence of characters R-O-N
maatkan, mannenhoofd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "maatkan" starts with the /m/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "mannenhoofd". In both cases, the letters 'M' appear as the initial consonants. This indicates that they share the same consonantal phoneme (/m/) to start their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
dubbelsprongen, doorstuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "dubbelsprongen" starts with the /d/ sound (a voiced alveolar stop), while the second word "doorstuur" also begins with the /d/ sound. This indicates that both words start with the same consonant sound (/d/).<|eot_id|>
plantluis, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "plant" (Dutch for 'plan') and "interimaat" start with the /p/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "plant" starts with the letter combination "pl", which is typically pronounced as a voiceless alveolar plosive (/p/) followed by a labiodental approximant (/l/).* Similarly, the first part of the compound noun "interimaat" begins with the letters "in-", but in
landbeer, leemaarde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "land" and "leimaarde" start with different sounds, not just letters. However, when we look at their pronunciation in phonetic transcription (IPA), they both have /l/ as their initial consonantal sound:* "Land" is pronounced as [lant] or [lɑnt]* "Leimaaarde" is pronounced as [ˈlimaardə]So although the spelling differs, both words share the
Jut, binnenstroomden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jut" and "binnenstroomden" both start with the /xʊt/ or /xt/ phonetic combination.Justification:* The word "jut" is pronounced as [ˈyʉt] in Standard Netherlands Dutch.	+ In this pronunciation, the letter combinations 'ju' represent a single syllable starting with /xʊ/, which can also be transcribed as /xt/.* The word "
handelwijs, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "handel" and "ontduik" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows:* Handel: /ˈɦandlei̯s/	+ The letter combination "hd" in Dutch is typically pronounced as [x], which represents the voiceless velar fricative (the equivalent to English's 'ch' or German's 'cht').
degenstok, doffiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "degenstok" starts with the letter combination "/d", which represents the voiceless alveolar stop /t/. On the other hand, the second word "doffiger" also begins with the letters "/d", representing again the voiceless alveolar stop /t/, making them both start with the same consonant sound (/t/) or phoneme in linguistics terms.<|eot_id|>
marken, melkbroden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "marken" and "melkbroden" start with the /m/ sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed 'M', which represents the voiceless alveolar nasal stop (/m/) in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). This means that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme, making them homophonous for speakers who pronounce them correctly.<|eot_id|>
duif, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "duif" starts with the /dʏf/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced dental fricative followed by a vowel-like sound (/dyuɪp/). The second word "kerkerende" also begins with the /k/ sound, which represents a voiceless velar plosive (the "hard k"). Although they don't have exactly identical sounds in terms of place or manner of articulation, both start
ritmeren, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "ritmeren" starts with /r/, which is also the starting letter of "/sk-" in the second word "sciopticons". Although they do not share exactly the same letters, both start with sounds that can be represented by the Latin alphabet as 'R' or 'Sk', respectively. Therefore, I conclude that the two words indeed begin with the same consonant sound (/r/) or at least have similar phonetic beginnings.<|eot_id|>
psychoanalytici, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "psychoanalytic" (from English) and Jutters ("Jutsen", from Dutch, means to cut or prune something) both start with the /ps- sounds in their respective languages. In phonetics, this is referred to as homorganic initial stops (/p/ and /s/) which share similar articulation points despite being different letters. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
etnisch, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "etnisch" starts with /ɛt-/, which is pronounced as "eth". Similarly, the second word "evocerend" also begins with /v-, ev-. Although they don't share exactly the same letter combination (/t-v/ vs./e-v/), both start with sounds that can be approximated to have similar initial consonantal quality (voiced stops/thuds). In phonetics, this would fall under the category
duif, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "duif" and "toereikend" both start with the /dʋ/ or /tɾ/ sounds.Justification:* The word "duif" starts with a voiced dental fricative [ð], which is often transcribed as /dʋ/.* Similarly, the prefix "toe-" in "toereikend" also begins with that voiceless alveolar stop followed by a close approximant [
duif, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "duif" starts with /d/, which is also the beginning of the second word "tas". Both words share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/t/) followed by different vowels in each case (uie vs as). This indicates that both start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
jut, antwoordend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jut" (just) and "-antwoordend" (-answeringly) both start with the /tʰ/ or 'th' sounds.Justification:* The word "jut" starts with a voiceless alveolar plosive followed by a voiced dental fricative (/d͡z/) which is often pronounced as [θ] in English.* In contrast, the prefix "-ant-" also begins with this exact
penningplaten, permit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "penningplaten" starts with /p/, which is also the starting letter of the second phrase "permit". Both phrases start with the voiceless bilabial plosive (/p/) in English, which corresponds to the same phoneme (consonantal unit) in both languages. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
Jut, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "jut" (meaning "out of order") and "-ontruimt" (- meaning "to vacate or to empty out", part of the verb "onttrekken", which means "to remove, take away") both start with the /tr/ sound, making them share the same initial consonant sound (/tsr-). This is because in many languages including Dutch, when you have consecutive letters like 't' followed by another letter that
kelderdeur, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "kelder" (meaning 'cellar door' in English) and "ontduiken" (which means 'to hide away') start with the /k/ or hard-c consonant sound, which is pronounced as [k] in both cases. The similarity between their sounds can be attributed to the shared origin of the two words from Old High German roots. In this case, we see that they indeed share the starting consonantal phoneme /k/.<|eot_id|>
etnisch, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "et" in "ethnisch" (Dutch for 'ethnic') and "k"-sound at the beginning of "kielvlak" start with /k/. The sounds may not appear identical due to language-specific phonetic differences between English and Dutch pronunciation systems; however, from a linguistic perspective, both sequences share the same initial consonantal value (/k/) despite potential variations in articulation or intonation during spoken speech.<|eot_id|>
pruimenboomgaarden, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "pruimen" and "voorgaanen" (not "voorlig", I assume that's a typo) start with the /p/ or /f/ sounds.Justification:In Dutch orthography, the letters combination 'pr' is often pronounced as [pf], which starts with a voiceless labiodental fricative (/f/) similar to English word "philosophy". On the other hand, "voor-" also begins with this exact sound ([
jatte, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "jatte" starts with /ʤ/, which is pronounced like a soft "g", whereas the second word "treknet" also begins with /t/. Although there's no exact match in terms of letter similarity (since "j" doesn't directly correspond to any English phoneme), both sounds can be represented by the International Phonetic Alphabet as [d͡z] or [ts], respectively, indicating that their initial consonantal
kruisbessestruik, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "kruisbessetruik" starts with the letter combination /kr/, which represents the voiceless velar plosive (/k/) followed by the liquid /r/.The second word "Ont-room-t" (assuming you meant to write this as one word) also begins with the letters /Ont-, where "/n/" is part of the prefix, but not necessarily affecting the initial consonantal sound.Although there might seem like some difference between their starting
vuilpersleiding, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "vuilpers" and "statica" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative, which is considered as the same consonant sound in phonetics. The rest of their sounds differ from each other (e.g., "-p-" vs no similar letter). However, since they share this initial "/v/" sound, we can consider them to have begun with the same consonant sound. In linguistics, when comparing two word-initial
deeltijdbanen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "deeltijdbanen" and "ontruimt" both start with /d/. In phonetics, this is known as the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal sound (/d/) or [d]. This means that they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
wispelstaartende, wolkachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "wispelstaartende" starts with the letter combination /ws/, which represents the voiceless labio-dental fricative (/f/) followed by the voiced alveolar sibilant (/s/). The second word "wolkachtigste" also begins with the letters "/ws/", representing again the voiceless labio-dental fricative (/f/) followed by the voiced alveolar sibilant (/s/
welpenleidster, waterchinees, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "welpenleidster" starts with the letter combination "W", which is pronounced as /ʷ/. Meanwhile, the second word "waterchinees" also begins with the letters "W". Although they may appear different at a glance due to diacritical marks (e), both words start with the identical phoneme /w/, indicating that their initial sounds share the same quality of being voiced labiovelar approximants. Therefore,
piepjongst, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "piep" starts with /p/, which is also the starting consonant of all other four words: "jong", "handi", "cap", and "rce". The justification for this response lies in phonetics where each language has its unique set of sounds or phonemes that distinguish one from another. In case of Dutch, there exist various combinations of vowels (a, e, i, o) followed by different sets of consonants (/
dassenhanger, duivelste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "dassenhanger" starts with the /ds/ sound, which is often represented by the letter combination 'ds'. Similarly, the second word "duivelste" also begins with the /ds/ or /dzv/ sounds (depending on how you pronounce it). Since both words start with this similar consonantal sequence (/ds/, in this case), they can be said to share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
pand, peperigst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "pand" and "peperigst" start with the /p/ consonant sound.Justification:In linguistics, phonology is concerned with the sounds of language, including their distribution and patterns. In this case, we can analyze each word individually:* "Pand" starts with the voiceless bilabial plosive /p/.* "Peperigst", on the other hand, also begins with the voiced labiodental fricative
Jut, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "Jut" (in "jut-") and "-zondags-" start with the /dʒ/ or /t͡s/ consonant sounds, which in phonetics can also be represented as [ts] or [dz]. The similarity between their initial consonants makes them share this characteristic. Note: In some English pronunciations of foreign names or loanwords, such differences might not always translate well due to linguistic variations; however
wegdruip, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wegdruip" and "blauwbekken-d" (note: "-bekkende" is the past participle form of "beken", which means to become wet or soaked) start with the /w/ consonant sound.Justification:In the first word "wegdruip", the combination "wd-" represents the voiceless labiovelar approximant phoneme /w/, whereas in the second phrase "blauwbekken
valsmunters, vuistregel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "valsmunters" starts with the letter combination /vls/, which is pronounced as /fəlz/. On the other hand, the word "vuistregel" also begins with the letters "/vj/", but when spoken in Dutch, this becomes more like /fyːstʁeɣəl/. Although there's no exact match between the two initial sounds (/vl- vs /vy-), both start
satansboleten, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "satansboleten" starts with /s/, which is also the first letter of the second word, "vuilpersleiding". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics: both words have the initial /s/ sound as their starting point, indicating that they share the same consonantal beginning.<|eot_id|>
dubbelsprongen, dijkheemraadschappen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "dubbelsprongen" and "dijkheemraadschappen" start with the letter combination "/dʊb-/" (the digraph "dd") which represents the /duːb/ or /tɪb/ sounds in English phonetics. This is considered as having the same initial consonant sound (/d/) despite being different letters in other languages like Germanic ones where both 'd' and
meridionaal, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "meridionaal" and "duivelsklauwen" both start with the /d/ or dental voiceless stop consonant sound, which is represented by the letter combination "dv". In phonetics, this would correspond to [t]. The initial sounds of both words share the identical quality of being voiced stops in the alveolar position (/t/, as opposed to other possible positions like labial or velar). This similarity indicates that they do
voorlegt, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "voorleg" begins with /v/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the word "statica". In this case, both words start with the voiced labiodental fricative (/v/) followed by different vowels and subsequent sounds in each word. This justifies my affirmative response that they indeed share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
plantluis, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "plant" and "-luis-" (which is part of the word "joystick") both start with the /pl/ or /kl/ sounds, which can be represented as the letter combination "PL". This means that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme, specifically the voiceless alveolar lateral affricate [pl]. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these Dutch words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
verlegd, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "verlegd" starts with the /v/ consonant, which is also present in the second word "ontduik". Both words share this initial /v/ sound, making them start with the same consonant phoneme.<|eot_id|>
zetterijen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "zetterijen" starts with the letter combination "zt", which represents the /tsʈ/ or /t͡sɪr/ phoneme, whereas the second word "nadook" begins with the letters "nd". Although they have different spellings, both start with sounds that can be approximated as similar to the English /d/ sound (a voiced dental stop). Therefore, I consider them starting with the same consonant
zouterijen, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zouterijen" and "detACHEER" start with the /dʒ/ or /t͡ʃ/ (soft ch) consonant sound.Justification:The word "zouterijen" starts with the letter combination "zu", which is pronounced as /zyoʊˈtrɛiən/, where the initial "z" sounds like a soft "ch".On the other hand, the word "detachEEr
trompetbomen, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "trompet" starts with /tr/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "voorraad". Both start with the exact same consonantal phoneme, namely "/tr/" (a voiceless trill). Therefore, they share this property, making them identical in terms of their initial consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
vakwerkconstructies, voordienen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "vakwerkconstructies" starts with the /v/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "voor-dienen". The 'd' in "-door-" can sometimes represent a voiced labiodental fricative [v], especially when followed by vowels like 'o', as seen here. Therefore, both words start with similar sounds (/v/) or more specifically, phonetically equivalent ones due to the presence of this voicing feature
regio's, rijpaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "regio" starts with /r/, which is also the beginning of "/rij-" in "rijpaard". The rest of the sounds following each word may differ, but at their onset, they share the same consonantal phoneme (/r/) making them homophonous for native speakers or those familiar with the language. In this case, both words start with the voiceless alveolar trill /r/.<|eot_id|>
meridionaal, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "meridionaal" begins with /m/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the second word "verlegd". The justification for this yes/no response comes from comparing the initial letters in each word, where both start with 'M' or 'V', respectively. Since they share identical consonants (/m/) at their beginning points, we can conclude that indeed, they do commence with the same consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
jut, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "jut" and "liefdes-" start with the /ʤ/ (or "soft ch") consonant sound.Justification:In Standard Dutch pronunciation, the letter combination "cht" or "tsch" is often pronounced as /ʤ/, which sounds like a soft "church". In this case, we have "jut", where the initial "j" represents that exact sound (/ʤ/) in Dutch phonetics. Similarly, when breaking down "
huidworm, hosselden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "huidworm" starts with /h/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "Hosselden". Both words have the initial phoneme /h/. Therefore, they share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
kamferballetje, kinkhoren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kamferballetje" and "kinkhoren" start with the /k/ consonant sound.Justification: In phonetics, the sounds of spoken languages can be transcribed using symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The /k/ symbol represents a voiceless velar plosive sound, which is what we hear at the beginning of each word in this pair. Since they share the same initial consonantal feature (/k/,), I conclude
wegtrekkende, watertanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wegtrekkende" and "watertandend" start with the /w/ or /v/ sound.Justification: The letter combination "wt" in Dutch is pronounced as a single phoneme (/w/) which corresponds to the English 'w' or 'vw'. This means that even though there's no actual vowel between them (like in other languages), they still form a unique starting sound for each word. In this case, both words share this initial /
koelkamer, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "koelkamer" starts with the /k/ sound, which is a voiceless velar plosive in phonetics (represented by [k]). Similarly, the second word "sciopticans" also begins with the /skʰ- or /s-kh-/ sound combination that can be transcribed as [ks] followed by a voiced soft palate elevation ([kh]), but for simplicity's sake we'll consider just the initial [
Babel, bijscholend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "Babel" begins with /b/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the compound noun "bijscholen-d". The hyphenated part "-scholen-" can't change this fact because it's still considered as one unit when looking at its pronunciation in spoken language.In phonetics, we call this phenomenon 'consonance'. Consonants that appear together or close to each other within a single syllable (or across multiple adjacent
weergeving, wafelvormigere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "weergeving" starts with the letter combination "/wər-", which represents the /vr/ or /wr/ phoneme, while the second word "wafelvormiger" also begins with the letters "/w-". Although they have different vowel sounds following them (/eɪ/ in "weergeving" vs./oʊ/ in "wafelvormige"), both words share the initial consonantal sequence starting with the voiced lab
meridionaal, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The two Dutch words "meridionaal" and "treknet" both start with the /m/ or "em" phoneme in English, which is considered as one of the most common consonant sounds in many languages including Dutch. This means that their first letters share the identical starting point, making them similar at this level. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these Dutch words indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
jut, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "jut" starts with /dʒ/, which is a voiced postalveolar affricate, while all other words start with different sounds:* "kruis-" begins with /k/* "-bes-"begins with /b/* "-sturuen" begins with /s/Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("J", "K"), their corresponding phonemes (/dʜ/, /k/) represent
roerhardere, rijksacademien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "roerharden" begins with the /r/ sound, which is also present in the second word "rijk-s-academie-n". The "-rh-" combination can sometimes represent a single phoneme (sound) like the English /r/, so I justified my response by comparing the initial sounds of both words, ignoring any prefixes or suffixes that may exist between them. Please note: Although this justification seems reasonable to me, please verify if there's anything
huidworm, hartsvriendinnen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "huid" starts with the /h/ consonant sound (the voiceless glottal fricative), while both "wormen" in "huidworm" and all of them ("hart-s-vi-j-en-d-in-nen") in "hartsvriendinnen" start also with this exact same consonantal phoneme (/hw/) which is often represented as /h/. In English orthography, when 'w' appears
roestkleurig, rondschreeuwend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "roest-" in "roestkleurig" (meaning rust-colored) and "-ronds-" in "ronDSchreeuwend" (meaning round-screaming) start with the /r/ consonant sound. The presence of different vowels or diphthongs between them does not change this fact. In phonetics, when two sounds appear together without any intervening segments that could alter their pronunciation, we can say that they share
wildspiegels, watertanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "wild" in "wildspiegel"s (meaning 'wild mirrors') and "wat-" in "watertandens" (meaning 'water teeth' or waterfalls) start with the /w/ consonant sound, which is similar but not identical to other sounds like /t/, /d/, etc., making them belong to the category of starting with the same consonant sound (/w/) while being distinct phonetically within that group.<|eot_id|>
koepelovens, kibbelzieker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "koepelovens" and "kibbelzieker" start with the letter combination /k/, which represents the voiceless velar plosive (/p/) followed by a vowel, making them share the same initial consonant sound. This phonetic similarity holds true across languages when comparing sounds in different linguistic contexts. In this case, we can conclude that indeed they do start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
maatkan, mastkoker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "maat" starts with the /m/ sound (a voiced bilabial stop), while the word "mast" also begins with the /m/ sound in its plural form ("masten"). Although there is no direct connection between them, both share the initial consonantal phoneme /m/. Similarly, when combined as part of compound nouns like "maatkamer", where one can find similar starting sounds for other letters too. This linguistic
kamerlid, koepelvormiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kamerlid" and "koepelvormiger" start with the /k/ consonant sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows: [ˈkaːmərʋlɪt] for "kamerlid", which starts with the voiceless velar plosive stop [/k]; and [ˌkuːpəlvɔrmɪx
zendamateurs, zongen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "zend" begins with /z/, which is also the starting point of "/s/" in the second word "zong". Although they have different letters, both sounds can be transcribed as [z] or [ts], depending on the pronunciation, but they share the same initial voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) phoneme. Therefore, I conclude that the two words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
treknet, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "treknet" starts with /t/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word, "vooreinde". The first part "-rek-" in "rekenen" (not present here) would change this to no, but without that prefix, both start with /v/. However, I should note that while they share similar letters at their beginning, phonetically speaking "/tr/" and "/v/" represent different sounds (/tɾekn
rentetarieven, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "rentetarieven" and "vuilpersleiding" both start with the /r/ or /v/ sounds, which in this case represent similar phonetic values (the velar approximant [ʁ] for "rentetarieven", and the voiceless labiodental fricative [f], but often pronounced as /v/, in "vuilpersleiding"). This is because of the linguistic phenomenon called assimilation, where
afgrijzenwekkendere, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, all five Dutch words "afgrijzend", "er", "statika", start with the /f/ or /r/ sounds.Justification:* The word "afgrijzend" starts with the letter combination "/af/", which is pronounced as /ɑːf/, where the first phoneme (/ʔ/) represents a glottal stop that's often transcribed as '/'. This can be considered equivalent to the initial consonantal sound.* Similarly,
wijkorgaan, wolfsangels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "wijkorgaan" starts with the letter combination "wj", which represents the /vɪx/ or /ʋɛk/ phoneme, whereas the second word "wolfsangels" begins with the letters "wl". Although they share some similarities in their spelling, both combinations start with distinct sounds that differ from each other. In this case, we can say that although not exactly identical, both words do have similar starting
heropvoeding, hartinfarct, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "heropvoeding" starts with /h/, which is also the starting point of "/hart-", as in "hartinfarct". The letter combination "-rt-" forms one phoneme (/t/) that follows immediately after the initial /h/. Therefore, both words share the identical consonantal beginning: /h/.<|eot_id|>
dubbelsprongen, dassenhanger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "dubbelsprongen" and "dassenhanger" start with the /d/ consonant sound.Justification:* The first word is spelled as "dubbelsprongen", which begins with the letter combination "dd".	+ In Dutch orthography, when two identical letters appear together (like double's' or 't'), they usually represent one single phoneme.	+ Therefore, in this case, we can consider that only one
loopgravenstellingen, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "loop" in "loopgravenstellingen" and "onduiken" (not "ontduik") start with the /l/ or /luh/ consonant sound.Justification: The word "loopgravenstellingen" starts with the prefix "loop-", which begins with the voiced alveolar lateral approximant (/l/) followed by the vowel phoneme "/oʊ/" (the "oo" diphthong).
zenuwpijn, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "zenuw" in "zenuwpijn" and "voor-" in "-voorlichtig" start with the /z/ or /ts/ (depending on language) phoneme, which is considered as part of the initial consonantal cluster for both words. In this case, we can say that they share the beginning sound represented by 'Z'. The rest of their spelling may differ but since only one letter distinguishes them from each
heropvoeding, hangoortafels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "heropvoeding" and "hangoortafels" start with the letter combination /hr/. This is because in some languages, including Dutch, certain letters or digraphs can produce distinct sounds that may not necessarily correspond to their individual phonetic values (e.g., 'ch' vs. 'k', etc.). In this case, both words share the initial sequence "/hr/", which indicates they do indeed commence with similar consonantal characteristics.<|eot_id|>
lijmerigste, lafste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "lijmerigste" and "lafste" start with the letter combination "L", which is pronounced as /l/. This indicates that both words share the initial consonantal phoneme of /l/, making them similar in terms of their starting sounds. The remaining letters may differ, but since we're comparing only the beginning part of each word (the prefix), yes, indeed, they have the same consonant sound at the onset.<|eot_id|>
piepjongst, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "piep" and "tachtigste" start with different sounds, but they both have similar prefixes that share the /pi-/, which is pronounced similarly to each other in Standard Dutch pronunciation (e.g., [ˈpit] for "piep", and [ˌpeɪ̯ərʏnt ˈhak.tɛç] for "tachtigste"). However, when considering only their initial
nachtcremes, nawerpt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "nacht" starts with the /kʃ/ or /xt/ combination, which is often represented by the letter combination 'cht'. Meanwhile, the second word "nawerpt" begins with the sequence of letters '/nw/', followed by the sounds /ɛr/, /p/. Although they don't share identical letters at their beginning (since there's no direct match between 'cht' and '/nw/' in terms of phonetics),
kamercommissies, korzeliger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kamer" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "korzeliger". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics: both words have identical initial consonantal sounds (/k/) followed by distinct vowels and subsequent syllables. This similarity highlights that they share common starting points despite having different meanings.<|eot_id|>
etnisch, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "etnisch" begins with the /tʃ/ (ch) sound, which is represented by the letter combination "chn". The second word "ordenden" starts with the /r/ sound. Although they don't share exactly the same phoneme (/tʃ/ vs /r/, respectively), both sounds can be considered as starting with different types of consonants: one's palatal affricate and another's alveolar trill. However
kamercommissies, countryrock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "kamer" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "kommissies". Additionally, all three words ("country", "rocks") in the third part do not start with the letter combination "-comm-", but rather "/ka/", "/rɒks"/ respectively; hence they don't affect our initial assessment about the starting letters of "kamer-commissies".So, we
lijkende, losstaan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "liijkende" starts with the /l/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "losstaan". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words have the initial voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (IPA symbolized as /l/) followed by different vowels and suffixes. In linguistic terms, they share the same onset but differ in their rhyme. This similarity justifies my affirmative response to your question about whether
attentie, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "attentie" and "nadok" start with the /n/ or nasal consonant sound.Justification:* The word "attentie" begins with the letter combination "at", which is pronounced as /ɑt/, but since there's no other preceding vowel in this context, we can focus on the initial consonantal phoneme, which is indeed /n/.* Similarly, the word "naduk" (not sure if you meant to type that
voorlig, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "voor" starts with the /v/ sound, which is also present in the word "tachtig", meaning 80 (the "-ch-" combination sounds like /kʰ/, but in this case, it's pronounced as /x/) and hence begins with the voiceless velar fricative (/ksər/) or [χ]. This means both words start with similar consonantal phonemes: voiced labial stop ([b]) for "vo
beschietend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "beschieten" starts with the /b/ consonant, while the second word "indeuk" also begins with the /dʒ/ (or sometimes pronounced as /j/) which is often represented by the letter combination 'dj' in English orthography or 'tch' before front vowels like e,i,y. Although they don't seem to start with exactly the same letters ('b'dj'), both sounds can be approximated to have similar characteristics:
vrijheidsklasse, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "vrijheidsklasse" starts with /f/, which is pronounced as a voiceless labiodental fricative (the 'F' in English).The second word "ontroomt" also begins with /ntr/, where "/nt/" forms a single phoneme that represents a voiced alveolar nasal-stop combination followed by a trill (/r/) before being released to produce the characteristic tongue-tip-trilling noise of some languages like
piepjongst, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "piep" starts with the /p/ sound, which is also present in all other words: "jong", "planimetrieeren". The suffix "-reer" doesn't change this initial consonantal sound as it's added to form the verb stem from its base or root. Therefore, they share the starting consonance of /p/.<|eot_id|>
kamerlid, koffieprijzen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kamerlid" and "koffieprijzen" start with the letter combination /k/. This is because they share the initial letters "K", which represent the same phoneme (a voiceless velar stop) in Standard Netherlands Netherlandic.Justification:In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), "/k/" represents a voiceless velar plosive sound, which is present at the beginning of both "kamerlid" (/ˈka
attentie, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "attentie" and "uitrokend" both start with the /a/ or /at/ phoneme, which is often represented as a single consonantal unit in English transcription systems (e.g., IPA). In this case, they share the initial sounds of "ah-" or "-tt-", respectively. Despite having different letters ("t", "u"), their pronunciation begins with similar consonance (/ʌtˈɛntiə/ for "
runderoog, rollend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "runder" and "rollend" do indeed start with the same consonant sound /R/. The first letter in both cases is 'R', which indicates that they share this common characteristic.Justification:1. Phonetic analysis: By examining the phonetic transcription of each word, we can see that their initial sounds match:	* Runder (ˈʁʏndəɳ) begins with a voiced alveolar trill ([ʀ
meetlinten, melkbroden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "meetlinten" starts with the /m/ sound (a voiced bilabial nasal), while the second word "melkbroden" also begins with the /m/ sound. Therefore, both words share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/m/) despite having different meanings in English as "meeting clover" vs. "milky bread". In this case, we can consider them to start with the same consonant sound
heksenbezem, hofbals, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "heksen" begins with /h/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "hof". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, where sounds that start with similar speech organs or air streams can produce identical or very close approximations to each other's pronunciation (allophones). In English-speaking countries like North America, 'h' represents voiceless glottal fricative [h], while in some European languages including Dutch, there may exist
rennersveld, rollend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "rennersveld" and "rollend" both start with the /r/ consonant sound, which is the same in both cases. This justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
miste, moutmeel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "mist" in "miste" and "mt-" in "mouTmeel" start with the /m/ or "em" phoneme.Justification: The letters "M", "t", and "h" have different sounds when pronounced individually. However, together they form a single sound /m/, which is often transcribed as "/ɛm/" (the letter combination "th" being silent). This means that despite having distinct individual pronunciations
doemdenker, doodrijdend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "doem" begins with /dʊm/, which is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar stop followed by a voiced vowel, while the word "dood" starts with /duːt/. Although they don't share identical letters (/d-), both start with the /d/ phoneme in Modern Standard Dutch pronunciation. The rest of each word's spelling doesn't affect this initial consonantal similarity. Justification: Phonetically speaking, both 'do
plantluis, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The two Dutch words "plant" and "-duivelsklauwen" both start with the /p/ or /pl/ sounds respectively, which can be considered as starting with the same consonant sound (/p/) in this case. In linguistics, when comparing beginning letters of different words across languages (including cognates), phonetic similarities rather than exact letter matches should be taken into account to ensure accurate comparison. Since there is no difference between the
Jut, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "Jut" and "zenuwpijn" start with the /ʤ/ or "j" sound.Justification: The word "Jut" starts with the letter combination "Ju", which is pronounced as /d͡ʒuː/, where "/d͡ʜ/" represents the voiced postalveolar affricate (the "ch" in "church"). Similarly, the first part of the compound noun "Zenuwpijn
wijdbefaamde, worgkoorden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wijdbefaamde" and "worgkoorden" start with the letter combination /wj/. This is because in many languages including Dutch, when two letters appear together that have different sounds but similar shapes (like 'j' and 'i'), they can influence each other's pronunciation to create distinct phonetic combinations.In this case:* The word "wijdbefaamde" starts with the digraph "/wj/" which has its own unique sound.* Similarly
joysticks, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "joystick" and "pruimenboomgaardenaanleggen" (not exactly equal to "pruimenboomgaarden", but I assume you meant that) start with the /j/ or /dʒ/ consonant sound.Justification: The first word is clearly pronounced as "joy-stikks". In this case, we have the voiceless postalveolar affricate [t͡ʃ] which corresponds to English letter combination '
piepjongst, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "piep" starts with /p/, which is also the beginning of each subsequent part ("jong", "ver", "kok"). This means that all four parts share the initial consonant sound "/p/", making them homophonous for this specific aspect (consonantal). Note that vowel sounds or other phonological aspects might differ between individual components; here we focus solely on the shared consonantal onset.<|eot_id|>
vochtende, voortsleept, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "vochtende" and "voortsleept" both start with the /v/ consonant sound, which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative in Dutch. The first letter of each word is "V", indicating that they share the beginning consonantal phoneme /v/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these Dutch words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
wijwatervat, waaghalzerige, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "wij" starts with /w/, which is also present in the second word "waaghals-erige", as part of the sequence "/waɣ/. The "-l-" in between does not affect this similarity, because when two sounds come together without any intervening vowels or other obstructions (like liquids), they can still share some phonetic features despite being distinct letters (/w/ vs. /l/) - here we have both starting with voiced labiovel
framepjes, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "framepjes" and "zondagsluiting" start with the /f/ or /v/ sound.Justification: In Dutch phonology, the letters "F", "V", and "P" all represent the voiceless labiodental fricative [f] (or close to it), which is pronounced similarly in most cases. The letter combination "-mp-" also tends to assimilate into this sound when followed by another vowel-consonant sequence
ontroomt, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ontroomt" and "blauwbekken" start with the /b/ or (beta) sound.Justification:* The word "ontroomt" starts with the letter combination "on-tr", which is pronounced as /ɔntˈrʊmt/, where you can hear the distinct beta (/b/) sound.* Similarly, the word "blauwbekken" begins with the letters "bla-", which when spoken together form the
versvoeten, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "vers" in "versvoeten" (pronounced as /vərsvuːtʰɛn/) starts with the voiceless labiodental fricative consonant sound "/vs/", while both letters "sc-" in "scioptrons" start also with this exact same consonant sound "/s/. Therefore, they share identical initial sounds."<|eot_id|>
kielvlak, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "kielvlak" starts with the /k/ sound, while the second word "bekwaamdern" also begins with the /b/ or /bk/ sounds (depending on how you pronounce it). Although they don't start exactly alike in spelling ("K" vs "B"), phonetically speaking, both can be considered starting with similar consonantal sounds (/k/ approximates to /p/, which is close enough to consider as matching for
pareloesters, penningkunde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "pareloesters" starts with the /p/ sound.The second word "penningkunde" also starts with the /p/ sound.Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound which is /p/.<|eot_id|>
Jut, beschietend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "Jut" begins with /dʒ/, which is a voiceless postalveolar affricate, whereas the prefix "-besch-" in "beschietsen" (which means to beset or besiege) starts with a voiced bilabial fricative /b/. Although they don't share the exact same letter ("j" vs. "b"), their sounds can still be considered similar because both start as stops (/t/ before vowels), followed
lijkende, larken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lijkende" starts with the /l/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "LARKEN". Although they differ in their spelling (the first one has a silent 'j' while the latter does not), both start with the voiced alveolar lateral approximant phoneme (/l/) represented by the letter combination "lj" or simply "L", respectively, making them share the same initial consonantal sound.
meridionaal, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "meridionaal" starts with the letter combination "/m/", which represents the voiceless bilabial plosive /p/. On the other hand, the second word "bagatellen" also begins with the letters "/b/" representing another instance of the voiced labiodental fricative /v/, but not exactly the same as "/m". Although they differ in their phonetic realization (voiceless vs. voiced), both start with distinct
Jut, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jut" and "voorgelieg" (not exactly "voorlieg", but I assume that's what you meant) both start with the /v/ or /f/ sounds in English.In Standard Dutch pronunciation, "/t/" is not pronounced as a distinct consonantal phoneme at the beginning of syllables; instead, voiceless stops like "/p/", "/b/", etc., become voiced to some extent before vowels starting with fronting d
kiezelbank, kibbelzieker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kiezelbank" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "kibbelzieker". The justification for this response lies in the phonetic similarity between the two words' initial sounds, specifically their identical starting consonants "/k/" being pronounced similarly when spoken out loud. This shared feature indicates that they do indeed start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
Dominus, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "Dominus" and "donkerden" start with the /d/ consonant sound.Justification: The letter combination in "Dominus" is "D-M-N-S", which all have distinct sounds except for the first one, which starts with a voiced dental stop (the "D"). Similarly, the letters in "Donkerden" spell out as "D-O-N-K-R-D-E-N", where again only the initial "D" has that exact voiceless
puistekoppen, pand, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "puistekoppen" starts with /p/, which is also the first letter of the second word, "pand". Both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiceless bilabial plosive phoneme represented by the letters "P".<|eot_id|>
wegdropen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "weg" in "wegdropen" and "esth-" (short for esthetic) start with /w/, which is a similar or identical consonant sound.Justification:In phonetics, the sounds /v/ and /f/ can sometimes approximate to each other when followed by another vowel (/i/) as they do here ("eg", not pronounced like English 'egg' but more like Germanic languages). However, since we're dealing with Latin-derived vocabulary where
kamercommissies, kappersaus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kamercommissies" starts with the letter combination "/km/", which represents the /kʰ/ phoneme, whereas the second word "kappersaus" also begins with the letters "/kp/" representing again the /kʰ/ phoneme in standard Dutch pronunciation. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/kʰ/) although they have different vowel sounds following this initial segment.<|eot_id|>
kielvlak, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "kiel" in "kielvlak" and "indok-" in "indoken" start with the /kʰ/ or hard "kh" consonant sound, which is represented by the letter combination "kl". This indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (the sounds of letters at the beginning of a word).<|eot_id|>
regelingen, roerhardere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "regelingen" starts with the letter combination "r-g", which represents the /ʁɡ/ sound, where "/ʁ/" is a guttural trill (similar to the Scottish "ch") followed by the voiced postalveolar fricative (/g/).The second word "roerhardeR" also begins with the letters "r-h-r". Although they differ in their vowel sounds after the initial consonants ("-e-"
nachtcremes, neerplenzende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "nacht" starts with the /nk/ sound, which is pronounced as a single unit in many languages including English. Similarly, the second word "neerplenzende" also begins with the /nr/ or /nlz/ sounds (depending on how one pronounces this long Germanic compound), but when broken down into individual phonemes (/ˈneɪr ʔpleŋ.zəndə/) we can
wandelpassen, waterchinees, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wandelpassen" and "waterchinees" start with the /w/ or voiced labiovelar approximant phoneme.Justification:In the first word, "wandelpassen", we have the letters 'W', which represent this specific consonantal sound.Similarly in the second word, "waterchinees", again at the beginning of the word there is another occurrence of the letter combination that represents the voiceless alveolar stop followed by the vowel sounds
zenuwpijn, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "zenuwpijn" starts with the letter combination "zn", which begins with the /z/ or "dz" sound, while the second word "trompetboom" starts with the letters "tr". Although they have different starting letters (n vs r), both start with sounds that can be represented by the phonetic transcription "/tr/" in English pronunciation systems. In this case, I consider them to share the same initial consonantal quality
jut, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "jut" (meaning "youth") and "pruimenboomgaard" ("plum tree garden") both start with the /xʊt/ or /xt/ sounds, which is similar to the English letter combination "ch". The initial consonants in each word have a distinct voiceless palatal stop followed by a vowel, making them share a common starting point despite being different letters.<|eot_id|>
plantluis, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "plant" and "indeuk" both start with the /p/ or /pl/ consonant sounds.Justification: In Standard Dutch pronunciation, the word "plant" starts with a voiceless alveolar plosive (/pl/) followed by a vowel sound ("plan-t"). Similarly, in Standard Dutch pronunciation, the verb "indeuk" (meaning "to think") also begins with this combination of phonemes (/in-deu-k), where "/
wegkijk, waterchinees, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "weg" starts with /v/, which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative (like in "very"). Similarly, all three subsequent words ("kijk", "water", and "chinees") also start with /w/. Therefore, despite their different meanings, they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/w/) or sounds.<|eot_id|>
vergokte, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "vergokte" starts with /v/, which is also the beginning of "/inv-" in "invul". The justification for this response lies in the phonetics of both words: * In "vergokte", we have a voiceless labiodental fricative [v], followed by other sounds.* Similarly, in "invul", there's again a voiced or voiceless velar nasal approximant [/n] preceding
pittiger, pufheter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "p" in "pittiger" and "ph" (which represents /f/) in "pufheter" start with the voiceless bilabial stop consonant sound, which is represented by the letter combination "P". Although they appear differently due to language-specific spelling conventions, their phonetic values match, making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
regio's, roze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "regios" (plural of "regio", meaning regions) and "roze" both start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter in each word is written as 'R', which represents the voiceless alveolar trill or flap [r] phoneme in Standard Dutch pronunciation. This means that they share the same initial consonantal sound (/r/) despite having different vowel combinations following them. In linguistics, this
liefkozend, losgespende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "liefkozend" and "losgespende" both start with the /ls/ or /lz/ consonant digraph, which represents a single phoneme in Dutch (the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative). This means that they share the same initial consonantal sound despite having different meanings and spellings.<|eot_id|>
planimetreer, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "planimètre", begins with the /pl- sounds (the letter combination is pronounced as one unit), which represents the voiceless alveolar plosive followed by the labiodental approximant in English pronunciation.On the other hand, the second word, "naduien", starts with the /n- sounds, representing the nasal stop. The beginning of both words have different phonetic properties: /p/ vs /n/. In this sense,
radende, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "radende" starts with the /r/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "esthetiek", starting as "/s/" but followed by "/t/", making both sounds similar to the English voiceless alveolar trill [tr] or dental fricative [θ]. While not identical, they share a common initial consonantal quality that can be considered equivalent for practical purposes in this case.<|eot_id|>
woelige, wegvretend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "woelig" (meaning restless or agitated) and "wegvarend" (meaning wandering away) both start with the /w/ consonant sound, which is represented by the letter combination "wo". This suggests that they share a similar beginning consonantal feature in their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
tensie, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "tensie" and "pruim-" start with the /tr/ or /tsr/ combination, which can be considered as having the same consonant sound in this context (the difference between 't' and 'p' being negligible). The remaining letters differ significantly enough to make them distinct from each other phonetically speaking. Therefore, I conclude that they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
versmallen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "versmallen" starts with the /v/ consonant sound, while the word "Esthetica" (note that this is likely meant to refer to Esthétique) begins with the /s/ consonant sound. Although they do not start exactly alike in terms of their phonetic transcription (/vɛrˈsmaːlən/ vs. /eʃ.ti'tika/, respectively), both sounds can be
zuursel, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zuursel" starts with the /z/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the phrase "regimentscommandant", specifically in the prefix "/re-/" that sounds like /r/. Although written as different letters (/s/ vs./r/, they represent similar phonetic values due to the differences between spoken and written language (e.g., voicing). Therefore, both start with the same consonantal value [ʒ] or approx
voedingssupplementen, voorraadschuren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "voedingssupplementen" starts with the /v/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative (like the "b" in "best"). The second word, "voorraadschuren", also begins with this exact same consonantal combination (/v/) followed by different vowel sounds ("ooraad-" vs "-oi-").Justification: Both words have identical initial phonemes represented by the letter sequence "/v/", indicating that
marktdagen, mentrix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "markt" in "markt dagen" (Dutch for "market days") and "mentr-" in "-mentrix" start with the /m/ sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be represented as follows:* The first syllable of "markt dagen", "/mar-", starts with a voiceless alveolar stop followed by a continuative approximant: [mk]* In contrast, the prefix "-men-tr
Dominus, domkapittel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "Dominus" begins with the /d/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced alveolar stop in English. The second word "domkapittel" also starts with the /d/ sound, which represents another instance of that same phoneme (the smallest unit of speech). Since both words start with the identical sound (/d/) they share the same initial consonant.<|eot_id|>
duif, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "duif" and "ordenen" start with the /dʋ/ or voiced labiodental fricative, which is often represented as /v/. This means they share the same initial consonantal phoneme, despite being written differently in English transcription (with a distinct letter combination for each word). In this case, we can say that both words indeed begin with the same consonant sound (/v/) although their orthography may differ slightly due to
vinkers, vuurwerkers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "vinkers" and "vuurwerkers" both start with the /fʃ/ or voiceless palatal fricative (the so-called 'ch' sound) which is often represented by the letter combination "vh". This indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme, making them homophonous in terms of their beginning sounds. In other words, when spoken aloud, the starting parts of each word would have similar acoustic
planimetreer, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "planimeteren" starts with the /pl/ consonant sound, which is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar plosive followed by a labiodental fricative (/p/ʎ). The second word "aanwijzen", however, begins with the /aːn-/, where "/ɑ/" represents a low back rounded vowel and "-w-" represents a voiced bilabial approximant (the combination of sounds can vary depending
uitreikend, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "uitreiken" starts with the /uɪtʁaɪˈkən/ sound, which begins with the voiceless alveolar fricative consonant /t/. The second word "voorgelieg" also starts with this exact same consonant sound /t/.Justification:1. Phonetic analysis: By analyzing the phonetic transcription of each word (uitreike -> /uɪtʁaɫ
Jut, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "Jut" and "tensie" start with the /j/ or soft-g sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is written as 'J', which represents the voiced postalveolar affricate [dʒ] in phonetics (the combination of sounds found in the English letters "ch" in "church"). This means that they share the initial consonantal sound /j/.<|eot_id|>
jut, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "bekwaamd"-en (note: "-en" is a suffix indicating plural or third person singular) both start with the /bʋ/ or /bj/ consonant sound.Justification:* The letter combination "jb-" in "jut" represents the /d͡z̩uːt/ pronunciation.* In "bekwaamd", the letters "bkw-" represent the /bək'
trompetboom, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "trompet", starts with /tr/, which is represented by the letter combination 'tr'. The second word, "invallen", also begins with /v/. Although they do not share exactly the same letters (‘t’ vs ‘v’), both sounds start with voiceless alveolar stops (/p/ or /t/) followed by another distinct phoneme in each case ('r' for “trompet” and nothing/nothing for "inv
lijkende, loonde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "lijk" in "liijkende" (meaning'similar' or 'alike') starts with /l/, which is also true for "loond" in "loonde" (meaning 'wages'). The letters have different shapes, but they represent the same phoneme (/l/) when pronounced. In linguistics, this phenomenon is called initial-consonantal homophony.<|eot_id|>
treknet, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "treknet" begins with the /t/ consonant sound, while the second word "bediendaars" also starts with the /b/ consonant sound. However, in Dutch language, /t/ is pronounced similarly to /d/, which means that both sounds can sometimes be transcribed as [ð] or [th]. So although they don't start exactly alike phonetically (since /t/ has a slight difference from /b/)
delfstof, doodgedeeld, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "delfstof" and "doodegeled" start with the letter "D", which represents the /d/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "delfstof" starts with the letters "De-".* The prefix "door-" in the compound noun "doodegeled" also begins with the letter "D".Since they share the initial consonant phoneme "/d/", I conclude that yes, the two words do indeed begin
versmaat, vochtende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "versmaat" starts with the /v/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "vochtende". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/v/).<|eot_id|>
kemelsgaren, koortrans, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "kemelsgaren" starts with /k/, which is also the beginning of the second word "koortrans". Both words start with the letter combination "/km/", making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
negerwijk, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "neger" and "sciopticon" both start with the /sʃ/ or "sh" sound.Justification:In phonetics, the letter combination "sch" is pronounced as [sx] in many languages including English and Dutch. The word "neger", which means 'negro' (not recommended to use due its offensive connotation), starts with this specific sound (/nxɛr/) while the hypothetical word "scio
lispen, lendeberoerte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "lispen" starts with /l/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme in the second word "lendeer". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
degenstok, doodgedeeld, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "degenstok" starts with /d/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "doodgedeeld". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics, specifically in the identification of similar sounds within linguistic structures. In both cases, we have the voiceless alveolar stop [d] as their initial consonants. This similarity supports my affirmative conclusion that they share the same consonant start.<|eot_id|>
wandelpassen, waaghalzerige, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "wandelpassen" begins with /w/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word, "waaghalzerige". In this case, both words start with the voiceless labiovelar approximant [ʷ] or its closest approximation in English phonetics (/w/). This justifies my affirmative response: yes, they do indeed share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
lijkende, leemaarde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "lijkende" and "leemaaard" start with the letter combination "/l/" which represents the same consonant sound.Justification:In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), the sounds in question can be transcribed as /liːkəndə/ for "lijkindé", where the initial sequence is [lj], and /limaːrte/ for "Leemaaard", also starting with [lm]. Although they differ slightly due
tensie, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "tensie" starts with /ts/, which is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar stop followed by a fricative sibilant (/ts/. The second word "schreeuwerige" also begins with /schr/, where /s/ represents a voiced or unvoiced alveolar fricative, and /r/ stands for a trill (a vibration of the tongue against the roof). Although there's no exact match between their
wispelstaartende, wegtrekkende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "wispelstaartende" starts with the /ws/ combination of sounds (a voiceless labiovelar fricative followed by a voiced alveolar trill), while the second word "wegtrekkende" also begins with the /ws/ combination of sounds. Both words share this identical initial consonantal sequence (/ws/).<|eot_id|>
tachisme, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "tachisme", starts with the /tʃ/ (ch) sound, which is represented by the letter combination "tc" in English orthography. On the other hand, the second word, "-aanvijl", begins with the /ɑn-/ sequence of sounds, but since there's no distinct consonantal onset before this vowel cluster, we can consider its starting point to be roughly equivalent to a glottal stop or
kamercommissies, koffietafelde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two phrases "kamercommissies" and "koffietafeldes" both start with the letter combination /kɑmər-/, which represents the phoneme /k/. The similarity in their initial sounds is due to sharing the identical letters 'K' at the beginning of each word, followed by distinct vowels and suffixes. This justifies my affirmative response: yes, they do indeed share the same consonantal starting point.<|eot_id|>
loonde, ladingskromme, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "loonde" starts with /l/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "ladings", as well as in the third word "kromme". Therefore, all three words start with the same consonant sound /l/.<|eot_id|>
houtrijk, heksenbezem, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "houtrijk" and "heksenbezem" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "houtrijk" starts with the letter combination "H-O-U-T", which represents the phoneme /huːt/, where "/hu/" is pronounced as a single unit.* Similarly, the word "heksenbezem" also begins with the letters "H-E-S-K-", but in this case, the correct pronunciation would
huidworm, hartaderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "huidworm", starts with /hw/, which is a combination of the sounds /h/ (the voiceless glottal fricative) and /w/. The second word, "hartaderen" begins with /hrt/, where "/hr/" represents the voiced labiodental trill followed by the alveolar approximant /t/.Although they appear to have different letters at the beginning ("H" vs. "HR"), both start
taswoning, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "taswoning", starts with /t/, which is also the initial consonantal sound of the second word, "esthetica". Both sounds share the similar phoneme /t/. Therefore, they start with the same consonant sound (/t/) in both cases.<|eot_id|>
deeltijdbanen, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "deeltijdbanen" starts with the letter combination "/d-", which represents the voiceless alveolar stop /tʰ/. Similarly, the second word "sciopticons" also begins with the letters "/s-", again representing the voiced postalveolar fricative /z/, but not the exact start of the word since there's another silent 'c' before that. Although they don't share identical starting sounds (/d
loonde, lessende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "loonde" starts with /l/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "lessende". Both words have the initial consonantal phoneme /l/. Therefore, they share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
koffietafelde, kappersaus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of words, "koffie" and "kappers", both start with the letter combination /k/. In phonetics, this is represented as the voiceless velar plosive (/k/) followed by no additional sounds (in this case). This means that they share the initial consonantal component, which includes the identical starting letters "/k". Therefore, I conclude that yes, the Dutch words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
maatkan, meesmuilend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "maat" begins with /m/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "mees". The justification for this conclusion comes from comparing their phonetic transcriptions: "/ˈmatkɑn/" (pronounced as MAHT-kahn) starts with /m/ while "/mezmylənd/" (MEZ-my-lund) commences with another instance of /m/. Both sounds share the identical initial
Jut, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "Jut" starts with /dʒ/, which is pronounced like a soft 'ch' or 'g', while the second word "hartzwakte" also begins with /h/. Although both sounds may seem different at first glance, in phonetics, /j/ (the palatal approximant) can sometimes develop into /h/ when influenced by other languages such as English. In this case, I'm assuming that
houtrijk, hartsvriendinnen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "houtrijk" starts with /h/, which is also present in the second word "hartvriendinnen". Although they have different letters, their initial sounds match due to phonetic similarity between English letter combinations like "hr", "ht", etc., being pronounced as /h/. In this case, both start with that distinctive /h/ sound.<|eot_id|>
ontduik, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "ontduik" starts with the /nt/ digraph (a combination of two letters), which represents the [n̩t] phoneme in Standard Dutch pronunciation.Similarly, the word "invul" also begins with the /nv/ digraph, representing the [ɳvʊl] or [ŋvʊl] phonemes depending on the dialect or speaker's accent.Although both words start with different letter combinations (/
voorlig, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "voor" begins with the /v/ sound, which is also present in the first part of the compound noun "regiment". The second half of this word ("ments") starts with another different sound (/m/) but does not affect our comparison as we only consider the beginning sounds. Therefore, both parts start with either /f/, v or b (the voiced labial fricative), so they share similar initial consonantal phonemes. However, please note that
lipvormige, leraarden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "lip" in "lipvormige" (meaning 'lipped' or 'rimmed') starts with /l/, which is also the first letter of "Leraard" in "leraarden", meaning to learn or study. The initial consonants share the identical phonetic value, making them start with the same consonant sound (/l/) despite being different letters.<|eot_id|>
regelingen, rondschreeuwend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "regelingen" starts with the /r/ sound (a voiced alveolar trill), which is also present at the beginning of the word "rondscheeuwending". Both sounds share the identical initial phoneme /r/. This means that both words start with the same consonantal sound, specifically the voiceless retroflex approximant [r].<|eot_id|>
voorlieg, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "voorlieg" starts with the /v/ sound (voor), while the second word "onneembaarder" also begins with the /n/ or /nh/ sounds (/nn/, in this case). Although not exactly identical, both start with similar nasalized stops which can be considered as starting from a common place of articulation for many languages including English where we would pronounce them similarly. In phonetics terms, we
jut, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "jut" starts with /dʒ/, which is a voiced postalveolar affricate in English phonetics transcription. In contrast, the second word "schreeuw-" (from schreeuwerig) begins with /skrɛˈux-/. Although both sounds have different letters (/t/ vs. /s/) at their onset, when pronounced by native speakers of Dutch or other languages that use similar
gelukzoekster, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "gelukzoekster" starts with the letter combination "/g/", which represents the voiceless velar stop /ɡ/. On the other hand, the word "aanvijl" also begins with the letters "/a/" followed by the voiced labiodental fricative /vj/, but in phonetics, this is often transcribed as /fj/ or simply /vʝ/.Although both words have different starting sounds (/ɡ
landbouwarbeidswetten, lege, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "landbouwwarbeidswetten" starts with the letter combination "/l/", which represents the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (or sometimes referred to as the voiced labiovelar fricative) in phonetics. Meanwhile, the second word "lege" begins with the letters "/l/" again, also representing that very same consonant sound. Therefore, both words start with the identical /l/ consonant
woudduivel, wolfsangels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "woudduivel", starts with the /w/ sound (the voiced labiovelar approximant), which is also present in the second word, "wolfsangels". Both words start with this unique combination of sounds (/w/) that distinguishes them from other possible starting points like /p/, /t/, etc., making their initial consonants identical.<|eot_id|>
zuiplappen, zonnebaan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zuiplappen" and "zonnebaan" start with the /z/ consonant sound.Justification:In the first word "zuiplappen", we have the letter combination 'zu', which is pronounced as /zjuː/, but since there's no preceding vowel to influence its pronunciation, the initial /zj/ digraph reduces to just /z/. In other words, when not followed by another vowel or diphthong, the
cijfer, solovluchten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "cijfer" starts with /sʃ/, which is pronounced as'sh' in English. Similarly, the second word "solovluchten" also begins with /s/. Both words start with the voiceless alveolar fricative consonantal sound /s/, making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
havengebouw, halfblind, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "haven" (meaning harbor or shelter) and "half-blind" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification: The letters 'H' in each word represent the voiceless glottal fricative phoneme (/h/) which is pronounced similarly at the beginning of both words. This similarity indicates that they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
marcheroute, mekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "marcheroute" starts with the /m/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "mekt". Both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal sound /m/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
miste, melkpoeier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "mist" starts with /m/, which is also the beginning of the second word "melk". Although they have different letters, both start with the voiceless nasal stop alveolar /m/. This means that when pronounced in English or other languages where this phoneme exists (like most European ones), both would share the same initial consonantal quality. In linguistic terms, we can say their onset clusters exhibit identical [m]-sounds.<|eot_id|>
piepjongst, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "piep", starts with the /p/ sound, which is also present in the second word, "-versmalle-". The hyphen indicates that there's no independent vowel between them, so they share this initial consonantal phoneme (sound).<|eot_id|>
deeltijdbanen, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "banen" and "indeuk" start with the /b/ or /dʒ/ (soft g) consonant sound.Justification:* The word "banen" starts with the letter combination "bn", which is pronounced as a single phoneme (/ˈbeɪn/) in Standard Dutch.* Similarly, the word "indeuk" begins with the letters "ind-", but since the next letter is also a vowel ("e"), we can
wedergaf, wegruimend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "wedergaf" begins with /w/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word, "wegruimend", when pronounced as [v]. In standard Dutch pronunciation, the voiceless labial fricative "/f/" (represented by 'g' in this case) can become voiced to [β] or even silent before vowels like '/e/', making both words start with similar sounds (/w/) despite their different letters ('fg'). This phenomenon is
versmaat, vaarstokken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "versmaat" starts with /v/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the word "varstokken". In both cases, we have the voiceless labiodental fricative [f] or its closest approximation in written form as 'v'. Justification: The first letter in each word - V (V) for Versmaat and Vaartokken respectively - indicates that their initial sounds share similar characteristics despite slight
narcoanalyse, nawerpt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "narcoanalyse" begins with the /n/ sound, which is also the starting point for the word "nawerp". The justification lies in their shared initial letter 'N', denoting that they both start with the nasal-alveolar stop voiceless phoneme (/n/) followed by different vowels and subsequent sounds. In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as orthographic correspondence or graphemic similarity between two written forms of distinct spoken language units.<|eot_id|>
versvoeten, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "versvoeten" and "statica" start with different letters, but they both contain the /s/ or /z/ phoneme which is often pronounced as [ʃ] in Dutch (the voiceless postalveolar fricative). This means that while their initial letters differ ("v"s vs. "st"), their sounds share some similarities due to this common alveolo-palatal stop. In linguistics terms, we can say that although not
penningkunde, peetdochters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "penningkunde" starts with the letter combination /pənɪŋ/, which contains the phoneme /p/. Similarly, the second word "peetdochters" also begins with the letters "pee", representing the phoneme /pʰˈeːt/. Both words start with the voiceless bilabial plosive consonant /p/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
duif, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "duif" starts with /d/, which is also the first letter of the second word, "negerwijk". The reason for my justification lies in the fact that both words have distinct sounds represented by their letters: 'u' (vowel) followed by 'i', and then comes the initial consonantal phoneme '/d/'; similarly, 'n-e-g-r-w-i-k'. Both start with this specific sequence "/d/" making them share similar beginning
raagbollen, reddingstoestellen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "raag" in "raagbollen" and "reddingstoezel" (not "redestoestellen", I assume that's just a typo) start with the /r/ consonant sound, which is the same consonantal phoneme in both cases. The rest of each word differs after this initial segment.<|eot_id|>
duif, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "duif" begins with /d/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "zouterijen". Although they have different letters, both start with the voiceless dental fricative [dz] or simply the voiced stop /d/. The initial 'Z' in zouterijen represents this similar beginning sound as well. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two Dutch words do indeed share the same consonant sound at their onset.<|eot_id|>
vaderschapsverlof, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "vaderschapsverlof" and "taswoning" start with the /v/ sound.Justification: In phonetics, the initial sounds of two or more words can be compared by analyzing their place and manner of articulation (POA) as well as any distinctive features they may have. The letters 'V' in both cases represent voiced labiodental fricatives (/v/) which is why we consider them to share the same starting point despite being
busbanen, bijscholend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "bus" starts with /b/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "bijs". In phonetics, both sounds can be transcribed as [bj]. Although there's no identical exact match in English (since we don't have a single-letter 'j' like some languages), the closest approximation would still involve a voiced bilabial stop followed by a voiceless palatal approximant ([bj]). Therefore, I conclude
dichtmaken, doorstuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "d" in "dichtmaken" and "door-" (part of "doorstuur") start with the /d/ consonantal voiceless alveolar stop, which makes them share the same initial consonant sound (/t/) when pronounced correctly by native speakers or learners who pronounce them accurately according to phonetic rules. The remaining letters after each "d" ("-cht", "-oor-", etc.) do not affect this similarity since they come
voorlig, profilerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "voorlig" starts with /v/, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "profileren". The correct spelling for this latter noun would actually be "-d", not "-l", so we should consider its base form as "profilier-" (with no initial 'L'). Despite small differences between their actual spellings ("voorlig" vs."profiel-"), both start with the voiceless labiodental fric
ingestelde, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ingesteld" (instilled) and "aanwijzer" (pointer or indicator) start with the /ɪn-ʃtəld/ and "/aːn-vi-zər/" sounds respectively.The first letter of each word is 'I' in ingestelde and 'A' in aanwijzernot exactly the same but they do share similar starting letters (/ŋ/, /n/) which have different phonetic values
psychoanalytici, onderligger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "psychoanalytic" (psychaanalytica) and "onderliggen" start with different letters, but they both have the /p/ or /f/ phoneme as their initial consonantal sounds in Standard European Dutch pronunciation. The first word starts with /ps/, while the second one begins with /ʊndərˈliɣər/. Although not identical, this similarity is often referred to as having similar consonant beginnings due
woudduivel, wegvretend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "woudduivel" starts with the /hw- or wh- sounds (depending on pronunciation), which is represented by the letter combination 'wh' in English orthography. Similarly, the second word "wegvretend" also begins with this exact consonantal sequence of '/h-' followed by '-w-', making them share the same starting consonant sound (/hw/. This similarity holds true for both phonetic transcriptions as well
runderoog, rondbazuinende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "rund" in "runderoog" starts with /r/, which is also the starting letter of "/rd/" or "/rn"/ sounds in "rondbazuinende". The exact pronunciation may vary depending on regional accents, but both words share the initial phoneme /r/.<|eot_id|>
dichtmaken, datje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dichten" means to make something dense or thick, while "datje" is likely a colloquialism for "that". Both start with the /d/ consonant sound, which makes them homophonous in terms of their initial sounds. This similarity holds true even when considering the different vowel combinations following each consonantal prefix (/t/, /tsj/) as they still share the identical starting point: [d].<|eot_id|>
wegdruip, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wegdruip" and "-uitrokend" start with the /w/ or voiced labiovelar approximant sound.Justification: In Dutch phonology, the letter combination "wg" is typically pronounced as /ʋ/, which represents a voiceless labial-palatal fricative (or sometimes transcribed as [v] in IPA). This sound is similar to the English pronunciation of the letters "wh". The word "-uitrokend",
loopgravenstellingen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "loop" in "loopgravenstellingen" and "doek" (not "nadook", I assume that's a typo) in "nadook" start with the /l/ or /dʋ/ sounds.In Dutch orthography, the letters combination "oo" is often pronounced as /uː/, but when followed by another vowel letter like 'e', they form diphthongized vowels which can approximate to [oɪ
roofdierachtig, rollend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "roofdieren" (meaning: animal-like) and "rollennd" (not existing in standard dictionaries but could mean something like rolling or moving around) both start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification:The first word starts with the letters 'R', 'O', 'O' which represent distinct phonemes that together form the initial consonantal cluster /roʊf/. The second word also begins with the letter combination 'R',
huilerigheid, hartsvriendinnen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "huilerigheid" starts with /h/, which is also present in "hartsvriendinnen", starting at "/hr/" (which can sometimes be pronounced as /h/) followed by other sounds like "/s/", "/", etc.). Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiceless glottal fricative /h/. Justification: The justification lies in phonetics and linguistics. In this case, we need
loodwitfabriek, lekhoning, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "lood" in "loodwitfabriek" and "lekhonig" (not "lek-ho-ning", but rather "leh-khoh-nigh") in "lekhoning" start with the /lʰ/ or voiceless velar fricative phoneme.Justification:In linguistics, when comparing two sounds from different languages to determine if they share similar characteristics is called minimal pair analysis. In this case:* The first word
vuilpersleiding, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "vuilper" and "raden" start with the /v/ or /r/ sounds, which are similar in their phonetic value but distinct as different letters (or more precisely, digraphs). In this case, I consider them to share the same consonantal onset despite being written differently due to linguistic conventions for representing specific speech sounds accurately.<|eot_id|>
crisisteam, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "crisit" (from "crisis") and "steam" both start with the /kʃrɪsˈtæm/ or /krɪstəm/ sounds, which can be simplified to the single consonantal phoneme "/ks/" in English transcription. This means that they share the initial consonant sound of the letter combination 'KR'. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two Dutch words do indeed
doorbladeren, donderachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "doorbladeren" starts with the /d/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "donderachtigste". Both words start with the same consonantal phoneme /d/.<|eot_id|>
lispen, lekhoning, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "lispen" starts with the letter combination "ls", which represents the /lz/ or /lʃ/ sounds, while the second word "lekhoning" begins with the letters "lk". Although they don't start exactly alike in terms of exact phonetic transcription (/lz/, /klkŋɪnɛnt/) both share the initial consonantal sequence "/L/" followed by different vowels and subsequent segments. In this sense
duivelsklauwen, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "du" in "duivelsklauwen" and "sc-" in "scioptrons" start with /dʒ/, which is often represented as a single phoneme (a unit of speech) called the voiced postalveolar affricate, or simply a soft 'ch' sound like in "judge". This means they share the same initial consonantal quality despite being written differently due to language-specific spelling conventions.<|eot_id|>
wandelpassen, wegvretend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "wandelpassen" begins with the /w/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "wegvretend". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words have the initial sounds represented by the letters 'W' (which corresponds to the voiced labiovelar approximant [ʷ] or voiceless bilabial fricative [f]) followed by different vowels and suffixes. This similarity suggests that they share
delfstof, doorspoelend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "delfstof" and "doorspoelend" both start with the /d/ consonant sound, which is equivalent to the English letter combination of 'd'. This means that they share the same initial phoneme or starting sound in their pronunciation. In linguistics, this property is known as having the same onset consonantal feature.<|eot_id|>
kampongs, kinkhoren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "kampongs" and "kinkhoren" both start with the /k/ consonant sound, which is the same initial consonantal phoneme in each word. The justification for this response lies in the linguistic structure of the language itself. In Dutch, certain sounds or combinations have distinct characteristics that distinguish them from others. For instance, some letters can form specific patterns when paired together (like diphthongs). To determine if two words share similar
welbedachte, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "welbedachte" begins with the letter combination "/w/" which is pronounced as a voiced labiovelar approximant (/ʋ/) in Dutch.The second word "-esthetiek" starts with the letters "/e-" which can also represent the /s/ sound at the beginning of this syllable due to phonological rules in Dutch (the process called assimilation).So, both words start with similar sounds: velars or sibil
kelderdeur, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "k" in both "kelderdeur" (Dutch for 'cellar door') and "zenuwpiijn" (a type of pain) starts with the /k/ consonant sound, which means they share this phonetic property despite being different letters or sounds within their respective word combinations. The presence of other characters like "l", "d", "e", etc., does not change the fact that the initial letter/sound remains identical
lispen, losgespende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "lispen" starts with /l/, which is also the starting letter of "/ls-" in the second word "losgespende". The sounds /s- and -p- come after, but they do not change the fact that both words start with the consonantal phoneme /l/.<|eot_id|>
delfstof, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "delfstof" begins with /d/, which is also the starting letter of "/dn/" in the word "donkerden". Although there's no single initial consonant, both start with the voiced dental fricative /ð/. In phonetics, this is considered to share the same place or manner of articulation as a beginning point for comparison.<|eot_id|>
doorstuur, doffiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "doorstuur" and "dofferig" start with the letter combination /dr/, which represents the same consonant sound.Justification:* The word "doorstuur" starts with the letters D-O-R-S-T-U-U-R.* The word "dofferig" also begins with the letters D-O-F-F-E-R-I-G.* Although they have different vowels following the initial consonants (T vs F), their shared starting point is the phonetic
maatregel, meekrijgt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "maatregel" starts with the /m/ consonant, while the second word "meekrijgt" also begins with the /m/ consonant. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, which is "/m/" in this case.<|eot_id|>
gekaaide, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "gekaaide" starts with the /g/ sound (the voiceless velar stop), which is represented by the letter combination "GK". Similarly, the word "voorphig" also begins with the /v/ sound (the voiced labiodental fricative). However, I noticed that you provided the wrong second word ("vorhilg"). Assuming you meant to type "voorlig", this one indeed starts with the /
heksenbezem, hockeyclubs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "heksenbezem", starts with /h/, which is also the initial consonantal sound of the second word, "hockeyclubs". Therefore, they share the same beginning consonant sound (/h/).<|eot_id|>
handicaprace, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "handicap", starts with /h/, which is also the starting letter of the second word's prefix "/tch-", making them share the same initial consonant sound (/h/).<|eot_id|>
wegdruip, computeriseer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wegdruip" and "computeriseren" (the correct spelling) start with the /w/ or /v/ sound.Justification: The letter combination "wg" in "wegdruip" is pronounced as a single voiceless labiovelar approximant [ʋ] which corresponds to the English pronunciation of 'v'. Similarly, the word "computervseren" starts with the letters "com-pu-ter-v", where again
penningplaten, puntenveld, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "penningplaten" and "puntenveld" start with the /p/ consonant sound.Justification:* The first word, "penningplaten", begins with the letter combination "P-N".	+ In English phonetics, this would typically represent the sounds of two separate letters: /ˈpɛnɪŋ ˈpleɪtən/.	However, in Dutch orthography, digraphs like
pareloesters, penningplaten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "pareloesters" and "penningplaten" start with /p/, which is the same consonant sound in Dutch language. The sounds of /p/ can vary slightly depending on phonological context, but they share similar characteristics as voiceless bilabial stops (stops made by pressing lips together). In this case, we consider them to have started with the same consonant sound (/p/) for practical purposes.<|eot_id|>
bekwaamden, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "bekwaamd", starts with the /b/ consonant sound (a voiced bilabial stop), while the second word, "Esthetic-", starts also with the /s/ consonant sound (an unvoiced alveolar fricative). Although they don't share exactly the same phoneme (/p/ vs /s/) in modern orthography, their initial sounds can still be considered as similar or equivalent when considering historical pronunciation of Old-Nether
Jut, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "Jut" starts with the /dʒ/ sound, which is represented by the letter combination "j". Similarly, in the second word "Dienst", the first vowel-less segment begins with the /d/ sound, also often written as the single-letter abbreviation "d".Although there might seem to exist some differences between the two sounds (/dʒ/ vs /d/) at a phonetic level (the former being more of a
binnenvaartuigen, bouwsels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "binnenvaartuigen" and "bouwsels" start with the letter "B", which is pronounced as /b/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.Justification: The word "beginnen" in Dutch means to start or initiate something, implying that when we examine two words starting from their beginning letters (or sounds), if those letters happen to match, then indeed they would have started together, i.e., shared the exact identical first
kamerlid, kibbelzieker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "kamerlid" and "kibbelzieker" both start with the /k/ consonant sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows: [ˈka.mər.lɪt] for "kamerlid", which starts with the voiceless velar plosive consonantal sound (/k/) followed by the vowel sound schwa ([a]), then the liquid lateral approx
vaderschapsverlof, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "v" in "vaderschapsverlof" and "t" in "treknet" start their pronunciation as /v/. In phonetics, this sounds like [v] or voiceless labiodental fricative. Although they have different meanings and functions within each word, the initial consonantal sounds of "vaderschapsverlof" and "treknet" share the identical starting point "/v/" or voiced lab
verlegd, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verlegd" and "tassenwoninng" (I assume you meant to type "taswoning", which is likely a typo for "woonstasion") both start with the /v/ or /f/ phoneme.In standard Dutch pronunciation, "verlegd" starts with a voiceless labiodental fricative [vf] while "woonsoasisie" starts also with that exact same [vf]. The difference lies in
kerkerende, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "kerkerende", starts with the /k/ consonant sound.The second word, "-ontroomt" (which is part of the compound noun), also begins with the /ntr/ or /nt/ combination which can be pronounced as a single phoneme starting with /n/. Although not exactly identical to /k/, both sounds belong to the nasal-stop category in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) and share some similarities. Therefore, I consider them
treknet, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "trek" in "treknet" and "static" start with the /st/ consonant sound.Justification:In phonetics, the combination of letters "tr", when followed by another letter or group of letters that is not a vowel (such as "e"), typically produces the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal sound /tʃ/, also known as the "ch" sound. However, this rule does not apply to all languages, including Dutch
Jut, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "Jut" and "Omsi-" start with /j/, which is a single consonantal phoneme in this case (the letter combination "-si-" forms a digraph that represents the voiced postalveolar fricative [z], but not here). The letters "t", "m", and "s" following each word part don't affect their initial sounds because of the morphological structure involved; therefore, we can conclude that both
jatten, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "jatten" starts with /h/, which is pronounced as a soft, aspirated h-sound in English (like in "house"). The second word "vuilpersleiding" also begins with /v/. While they don't look similar at first glance due to their different spellings, both sounds (/h/ and /v/) share similarities - they're voiced labiovelar stops or fricatives that produce a similar mouth position when spoken by native speakers
wegdruip, avondfeesten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wegdruip" and "avondfeesten" start with the /w/ or "double-u" sound.Justification:In linguistics, when comparing sounds between two different languages (in this case, English vs. Dutch), phonetic transcriptions can help identify similar or identical sounds across language boundaries. The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is often used for such purposes.The IPA transcription of each word would look like:* Wegdruip: [
kreupelbossen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "kreupel" starts with the /k/ sound, while the second word "nadook" also begins with the /n/ sound which is not exactly equal to but close enough to be considered similar in phonetics. However, I would argue that they do share a commonality as both start with either voiced or unvoiced nasal sounds (/k/, /nd/) respectively. Therefore, my conclusion stands - yes, these Dutch words begin with the
jut, afgrijzenwekkendere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "jut" starts with /dʒ/, which is a voiceless postalveolar affricate (the "ch" in "church"). Similarly, the second part of the compound noun "-af-" also begins with /f/. Although there's another letter ("a") between them, both sounds can still be considered as starting from the same consonantal place because their pronunciation doesn't involve different parts of speech or vocal tract adjustments for
rentetarieven, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "rentetarieven" begins with the /r/ sound, which is also present in the second word "ondwik". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless alveolar trill stop [r] followed by different vowels (/eɪ/vowel combination vs. /ʊ/) respectively. In linguistics, sounds that share similar acoustic properties or articulation patterns can be considered as belonging to the same category of
gemeste, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "gemeste" and "taswoning" start with the /g/ and /t/ sounds respectively.Justification: In phonetics, when we analyze word pronunciation in languages like English or Germanic tongues (including Dutch), we consider individual letters as representing distinct phone units that contribute to overall syllable formation. Here:- The letter combination 'ge' typically represents the voiceless velar stop [ɡ] followed by a vowel.- Similarly, for most cases in
welbedachte, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wel" in "welbedacht(e)" and "static-" in "-statIca" start with /st/, which is the same consonant sound.Justification: The word "welbedacht(e)" starts with the letters W-E-L-, while "-statIca" begins with S-T-. Although they differ in their individual letter forms (W vs. S), when pronounced, both sounds represent the same phoneme /st/. This similarity suggests that the two sequences
losbarstten, laagstammigst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that all three words ("losbaar", "sten", and "laaggstemming") start with the /s/, which is the same consonant sound in each word, specifically:* "Los" starts with /l/s* "Sten" starts with /s/* "Laaggstm" (from "laggstamming") also starts with /s/Since they share this common initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) among them, I conclude
larken, levensverschijnselen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "larken" and "levensverschijnselen" start with the letter combination /lr/.Justification: The word "larken" begins with the sounds /L/ followed by /r/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme (/LR/) in many languages including English and Germanic languages like Dutch.The prefix "leven-" also starts with the letters L-E-V-, but since we're considering only the initial part of each word (the first three
beschietend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "beschieten", starts with the /b/ sound (the voiceless bilabial plosive), while the second word, "-esthetiek" is part of the larger word "aestheteik", which also begins with the /s/ sound (the voiced alveolar fricative). Although they don't start exactly alike in terms of phonetics or letters, both sounds can be approximated as starting with the same
jut, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "jut" (meaning 'to judge') and "orden-den" (a verb form of "orde", meaning 'order' or'regimentation', in this context) both start with the /dʒ/ consonant sound, which is represented by the letter combination "dj". This similarity in initial sounds justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
penningplaten, petekinderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "penningplaten" starts with the /p/ consonant sound.The word "petekinderen" also starts with the /p/ consonant sound.Therefore, both words share the starting point of their sounds in English phonetics as [p].<|eot_id|>
wachtwoord, waag, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "wachtwoord" starts with the letter combination /hw/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, often represented by the symbol "/hʷ/" in linguistic transcriptions. On the other hand, the second word "waag" begins with the letters /w/ followed by another vowel-consonant cluster /aa/. Although both words contain the letter "W", their initial sounds differ due to the presence of additional segments (/v/) or vowels
regio's, roerhardere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "regio" starts with the /r/ sound, which is also present in the second word "roerharte". Both words start with the same initial consonantal phoneme "/r/", making them share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
wildspiegels, wafelvormigere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "wildspiegels" starts with the /w/ sound (a voiceless labiovelar approximant), which is represented by the letters 'W'.The second word "wafelvormige" also begins with the /w/ sound, as indicated by its starting letter 'W'. Therefore, both words start with the identical consonant sound /w/.<|eot_id|>
etnisch, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "etnisch" begins with /ɛt/, which is pronounced like "ett". The second word "detacheer" starts with /dəˈtaʃe.r/. Although they don't have exactly identical letters, both start with sounds that can be approximated as a stop consonantal cluster starting with "/dt/" or similar in English pronunciation (like "dot"). This similarity justifies my initial yes response. However, please note that phonetic
toerekent, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "toerekent" and "esthetica" start with the letter combination "/t/" which represents the same consonant sound.Justification:* The word "toerekent" starts with the letters "T-O-E-R", where all three letters ("O" is not always considered in phonetics) contribute to its pronunciation.	+ /t/ (voiceless alveolar stop)	+ oʊ (a diphthongized vowel sound)
vaderschapsverlof, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "vaderschapsverlof" starts with /v/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "indeuk". The justification for this conclusion comes from phonetics: in both cases, we have the voiceless labiodental fricative [v] as the initial consonantal sound. This similarity suggests that the two words share common starting sounds despite their different meanings (paternity leave vs. study).<|eot_id|>
dubbelsprongen, doodgeergerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "dubbelsprongen" starts with the /d/ sound (a voiceless alveolar stop), while the word " doodgeërgerde" also begins with the /d/ sound (again, a voiceless alveolar stop). Since both sounds start with the exact same phoneme (/d/, which is pronounced similarly in many languages including English as a distinct 't' or 'th'), we can conclude that indeed, these two
woelige, weersatellieten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "woelig" begins with /w/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word, "weersatellieten". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless labiovelar approximant [ʋ], or more simply put, they share the initial 'w' sound. This similarity can help language learners recognize patterns between similar-sounding pairs like these two Dutch nouns.<|eot_id|>
meekrijgt, morzelen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "meekrijgt", starts with /m/, which is also the beginning of the second word, "/morzelen". Both words have the initial consonantal phoneme /m/.<|eot_id|>
indeuk, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "indeuk" and "sciopticons" start with different letters, but they both have /s/ as their first consonantal phoneme (sound). In linguistics, this is referred to as allomorphic variation or allophony, where distinct sounds can represent similar acoustic properties in speech. Despite being written differently, the initial /s/ sound remains consistent across both words. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these Dutch words do indeed share the
weersatellieten, wegkijk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "weersatellieten" and "wegkijken" start with the /w/ sound.Justification:In English orthography,'s' is often silent or followed by another vowel-consonant combination that changes its pronunciation (e.g., 'island','science'). However, in many languages like Germanic ones including Dutch,'s' usually represents the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/. In this case:- The word "we
wispelstaartende, wijkorgaan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "wispelstaartende" begins with the /ws/ consonant sound (a combination of 'w' and's'), while the word "wijkoorganen" also starts with the /wj/ or /wej/ consonant sound (again, a combination of 'w', 'i/j'). Although not exactly identical (/sw- vs /wej/), both sounds share similarities in their pronunciation and can be considered as starting with similar
roofdierachtig, rijksacademien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "roofdierachtig" starts with /r/, which is also the starting letter of "/ri/" in the second word "rijksscholen". Both sounds share the same initial consonantal phoneme, specifically the voiceless alveolar trill /ʁ/. This indicates that they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
radiostraling, rijpaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "radiostraling" (radiation) and "rijpaard" start with the /r/ sound in their first syllable, which is the same consonant sound. The phonetic transcription of both words would reflect this similarity:* Radiostraling -> [ˈra-di-o-strɑləŋ]* Rijpaard     -> [ʁiypaːrd]The initial sounds (/r/) share
zuiplappen, zielroerender, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zuiplappen" and "zielroeren" start with the /z/ consonant sound.Justification: The letter combination in each word is identical ("Z", followed by no other letters), which means they share the exact same initial phoneme (sound). This is because both words have the same starting letter (/z/) without any intervening sounds or diacritical marks that could change its pronunciation. As such, we can conclude that both words indeed commence with the
bedienaars, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "bedienaars" and "ontduik" start with the /b/ or /dʒ/ (soft-g) sounds.Justification: In Dutch phonology, the letter combination "dj" is often pronounced as a voiced postalveolar affricate [d͡ʐ] which can be approximated to a soft-g sound similar to English "j". Therefore, when comparing the initial consonants of the two words, we find that they share this
zetterijen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "z" in both "zetterijen" and "invul" represents the /z/ phoneme, which starts with the voiced alveolar fricative consonantal sound (/z/) or [z]. This means they share the same initial consonant sound, specifically the letter "Z".<|eot_id|>
piepjongst, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "piep", starts with the /p/ consonant sound (a voiceless bilabial plosive), while the second word, "-jongst-", also begins with the /j/ or /dʒ/ phoneme which is often represented by the letter combination '-ch-' in English orthography but has a similar palatalized quality to the initial 'pi' of the first word. Although not exactly identical, both sounds share similarities
kielvlak, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "kielvlak" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, while the second word is "statica", which also begins with the /s/ consonant sound (not /k/, but different). Since they don't share the same initial consonant phoneme (/k/ vs /s/) my response was "no". However, I understand that you might have intended to ask about another set of words starting with "/kl/" in both
lipvormige, lessende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "lipvormige" starts with the /l/ sound (a voiced alveolar lateral approximant), which is also present in the second word "lessende", starting at "/l/" as well. Therefore, both words share the same initial consonant sound, specifically the voiceless postalveolar fricative /l/.<|eot_id|>
liefkozend, lacto-vegetarier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "liefkozend" starts with /L/, which is also present in both "lacto-" (part of the compound adjective) and "veganer". Although "-r"- comes after "/v", some languages like English have instances where two different sounds can come from one letter combination (/vr/) or even vice versa. However, considering standard pronunciation rules for each language's phonology, I'm confident that all three start with
loonde, lendeberoerte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "loonde" and "lende-beroerte" both start with the /L/ consonant sound.Justification:In linguistics, phonetics is concerned with the study of speech sounds in languages. The /L/ symbol represents a voiced alveolar lateral approximant, which means that air flows out from between the tongue and teeth when pronouncing this letter combination. This identical starting point indicates that both words share similar beginning letters or initial consonants
dijkheemraadschappen, doffertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "dijkheemraadschappen" starts with /dj/, which is pronounced as a single unit, whereas in English we would typically pronounce them separately (/diɡ/) or (/dyukʊm/. On the other hand, the second word "doftjes" also begins with /dōf-/, where the 't' is silent (in some dialects of Dutch). Although there might be slight variations depending on regional accents
verlichtten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "verlichtten" starts with the /v/ sound, which is a voiced labiodental fricative (the letter combination 'vr' in Dutch). The second word "ondwik" also begins with the /n/ sound, but since there's no actual word starting exactly like this ("onduik"), I'll assume you meant to write another correct spelling of that word as "onderduiken", which still has its root beginning with "/
trompetboom, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "trompetboom" starts with the /tr/ consonant sound, which is represented by the letters 'T' and 'R'. The second word "blauwbekkend" also begins with the /b/ consonant sound, but not exactly because of its prefix "bla-", making both sounds distinct from each other in terms of their phonetic value. However, considering only the initial letter (first symbol), we can conclude that they do share similar
roosterkozijn, rondbazuinende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "roost" in "roosterkozijn" and "rondbaza-" in "rondbazuinde" start with the /r/ consonant sound, which makes them share the same beginning consonantal phoneme. The rest of their pronunciation differs beyond this initial similarity.<|eot_id|>
extraherend, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "extraherend" and "nadok" (not "nadook") start with the /nd/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "extraherend" begins with the digraph "nd", which represents the voiced dental nasal stop /ɳ/ followed by a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant /d/.* Similarly, in the word "nadók", we see that it also starts with the combination of two letters
wachtwoord, waterski's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "wachtwoord" starts with /v/ (the voiced labiodental fricative) while the second word "waterski's" also begins with /v/. Although there is no direct connection between the two sounds in linguistic theory (/v/ vs. /f/, for example), both letters 'W' represent this specific phoneme /v/ when pronounced in Standard Dutch pronunciation. Therefore, we can conclude that the initial consonants
doelvlak, doffiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "doelvlak" and "dofferig" both start with the letter combination /d/. In phonetics, this is known as a single initial consonantal cluster.In Dutch orthography, digraphs like "/dh/" or "/dt/" can represent different sounds depending on their context within a word. However, in the case of "doelvlak" (meaning "target area") and "dofferig" (adjective form of "d
lieveling, losstaan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "lieveling" and "losstaan" start with the /l/ sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be represented as follows:* Lieveling: /liːvəlɪŋ/	+ The first letter is 'L', which corresponds to the voiced alveolar lateral approximant sound (/l/)* Losstaan: /lostʰaːn	+
landbouwarbeidswetten, levensverandering, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "landbouwarbeidswetten" and "levenveranderende" start with the /l/ or "el" consonant sound.Justification:* The first word starts with the letters "L-A-N-D-B-O-U-W", which contains the phoneme /l/.* The second word starts with the letter combination "L-E-V-E-R-A-N-D-", also containing the initial /l/.The similarity in their starting sounds is due to the identical
regelingen, ruilhandel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "regelingen" and "ruilhandel" start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "regelingen" begins with the letter combination "re", which is pronounced as /rɛ/. This represents the voiceless alveolar trill in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).* Similarly, the word "ruilhandel" starts with the letters "ru", also represented by the IPA transcription "/rʊ".
taffen, toebreng, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "taffen" begins with /t/, which is also the starting point for the word "toebreng". Both words share the initial consonantal phoneme of /t/. This justifies my affirmative response, as both words exhibit identical beginning sounds in their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
voorlieg, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "voorlieg" begins with the /v/ sound, which is also present in the second word "vadervreugden". The initial letters of both words share the identical phoneme "/v/", indicating that they start with the same consonant sound (/v/) or [f] (depending on pronunciation).<|eot_id|>
voorlig, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "voor" starts with /v/, which is also the beginning of the second word "invullen". Both start with the voiceless labiodental fricative phoneme (/v/) in Modern Standard Dutch pronunciation, making them share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
kelderdeur, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first three words "kelder", "deur" (door), and "planimetrieeren" all start with the letter combination /kd/, which represents the voiceless velar stop followed by a dental fricative, making them share the same initial consonant sound (/kt/) in English phonetic transcription. This is because both 'K' and 'D' have distinct sounds when used as prefixes or standalone letters in their respective languages, but here they combine
duivelsklauw, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "duivelsklauw" starts with /d/, which is also the beginning of the second word "wegdruip". Both words share the initial consonantal sound "/d/" as their starting point. Justification: The phonetic transcription for both words shows that they start with the exact same sound in this case '/d/'. In linguistics, when two or more sounds appear at the onset (beginning) of different morphemes within
weergeving, watertanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "weergeving" and "watertanden" start with the /w/ sound.Justification: In linguistics, when analyzing word initial sounds in languages like Dutch, phoneticians consider the actual pronunciation of each word rather than just its spelling. The letters 'w' is often pronounced as a voiced labiovelar approximant [ʋ] or sometimes even as a voiceless bilabial fricative [f], which can vary depending on regional accents
korzeliger, kamferballetje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "korzeliger" starts with /k/, which is also the starting letter of "/k/" in the second word "kamferballetje". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/k/.).<|eot_id|>
ritmeren, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ritmeren" and "nadoken" (not "nadook", which is not a valid word) start with the /r/ or /rdj- sounds.Justification: In standard Dutch pronunciation, "ritmeren" starts with a voiced alveolar trill (/r/) followed by a voiceless dental fricative (/t/, which can sometimes appear as [d] in certain positions). On the other hand, "nadoken" begins with
piepjongst, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piep", "jong" and "-etnis-" all start with the /p/, /j/, or /h/ sounds respectively.Justification:* The word "piep" starts with the letter combination of "P".* The word "jong" begins with the letter combination of "JH". In some cases in Dutch pronunciation, 'ch' is pronounced as a sharp 'kh', which can also represent the sound of English's 'k'.*
piepjongst, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The two words "piepjongst" and "schreeuw-" both start with the /pʃ/ or "shh" sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription of Standard Dutch pronunciation. This is because "schre-'" starts with the voiced postalveolar fricative (/ʂ/) which has a similar articulation to the voiceless postalveolar fricative (/ʃ/) that begins the word "pie
bedrijving, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "bedrijven" (Dutch for 'business' or 'enterprise') starts with /b/, which is a voiced bilabial plosive, while "treknett" doesn't exist in standard dictionaries as a single word; however, if we assume you meant to type "tweeling", then it also begins with /t/. In either case, since they start with different sounds (/p/ vs /t/) or non-existent ("tre
gierehalzen, gas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "giere" starts with /g/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word, "gas". The two words share the initial consonantal phoneme "/g/", making them start with the same consonant sound (/ɡ/).<|eot_id|>
onderligger, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "onder" begins with the /ndr/ sound, which is pronounced as a single unit in Dutch. The second word "etnisch" starts with the /t/n combination, but since the sounds don't form a distinct phoneme pair (like /th/ or /ch/) they can still share similar acoustic properties when spoken quickly together. In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as coarticulation. However, for practical purposes, we consider them to start with
huurcompensaties, hangoortafels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "huurcompensaties" and "hangoertafels" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "huurcompensaties" begins with the letter combination "H-U", which represents the phoneme /h/.* Similarly, the word "hangoertafels" starts with the letters "H-A-N-G-O-E-R-T", but only the first letter "H" is pronounced as the /h
rotacisme, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "rotacisme", starts with the /r/ sound.The second word, "-voorlegt" (which is likely part of another compound noun), also begins with the /v/ or /f/ sounds, which in some languages can represent similar phonetic values as English's /r/. Although not exactly identical, they share similarities that make them start with roughly equivalent initial consonants. In this case, I consider their starting letters to have enough similarity for
zendamateurs, zero's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "zend" starts with /z/, which is also the starting letter of "/zero'". The second part "-damateurs-" does not affect this, as we're looking at only the initial consonantal sounds in each word. Therefore, both words start with the /z/ or'sibilant' sound, justifying my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
uitreikend, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "uitreiken" starts with /uɪt/, which is pronounced as the letter combination "ui". The first syllable of the second word, "Esthetic", begins with the letters "es-", but when considering its pronunciation in English (which may not exactly match how native speakers pronounce this term), we can approximate that it also starts with something close to "/s/" or no clear distinct consonantal sound at all, since there's no direct equivalent for the concept
roosterkozijn, rennersveld, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "roost" starts with /r/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "renner". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound /r/.<|eot_id|>
jut, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "jut" and "registratie" start with the /dʒ/ or "soft ch" sound, which is often represented by the letter combination "dj". This means they share the same initial consonantal phoneme. The rest of each word's spelling can differ significantly (e.g., "-regi-" vs. no other letters), but their starting sounds match.<|eot_id|>
tussenklanken, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "tussen" begins with /ts/, which is represented by the letters 't' and's'. The second word, "trek", also starts with /tr/. Although they do not have exactly the same letter combination (/tsu vs./tra), both start with sounds that can be transcribed as a voiceless alveolar stop (like in English "bus") followed by either a dental fricative or another consonantal phoneme, respectively. Therefore,
gekaaide, piepjongst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "gekaaide" begins with the /g/ sound (the voiced velar stop), while the second phrase starts with "/p/" in both cases ("piej-" and "-jongst"). The initial sounds of all three parts (/g/, /p/, and /p/) share similar characteristics: voicelessness or voicing is not affected by any intervening phonemes within each part; thus, we can conclude that those two phrases start with identical consonantal
hazeslaapjes, hosselden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "haz" in "hazeslaapjes" and "hos" in "hosselden" start with /hs/, which is often pronounced as a single consonantal cluster [ks] or sometimes even more softly like [z]. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed share the same starting consonant sounds.Justification:In phonetics, when two identical consonants appear together (consonance), such as double letters (/ss/) or consecutive instances of the same
huidworm, hongerlappen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "huid" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "honger". Although they have different vowel sounds that follow (/uɪd/ vs /oŋər/), their initial consonantal phoneme remains consistent as /h/. Therefore, I conclude that both words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
heropvoeding, hachelden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "heropvoeding" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "hachelden". Both words share the identical initial consonantal phoneme /h/.<|eot_id|>
narratiefste, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "narratief" starts with /n/, which is also the beginning of the second word "aanvrij". Both words share the initial consonant sound /n/.<|eot_id|>
Jut, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "Jut" and "nadanuiken" start with the /j/ or /dʒ/ (soft g) consonant sound.Justification: In Standard Dutch pronunciation, the letter combination "t-" is often pronounced as [ts] before vowels starting in front of the mouth like "i", but when followed by another vowel, this can change to [dj]. However, for simplicity's sake, we'll consider only the first syllable of each word here
wegdruip, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "wegdriep" starts with the /w/ sound (a voiceless labiovelar approximant), while the word "tactisch-misse" also begins with the /tw/ or /tʃ/ sounds which can both be represented as the combination of /t/ + /w/. Although English does not have exact phonetic equivalents for all languages' pronunciation systems, in this case, I consider that the initial
raagbollen, rondbazuinende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "raagbollen" starts with the letter combination /rɑːg/, which begins with the voiceless alveolar fricative consonant sound (/ʁ/) or more specifically the retroflex approximant ([r̠]) in IPA notation (International Phonetic Alphabet). The second word "rondbazuinende" also starts with the letters "/rn", where '/n' is voiced nasal stop and '/
woelige, weergeving, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "woelig" starts with /w/, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "weergeving". The justification for this answer lies in phonetics: both words have initial sounds that belong to the labiovelar approximant category (/w/) or bilabial voiceless fricative ([v]) when pronounced by native speakers. This similarity makes them share common characteristics at their onset.<|eot_id|>
duif, satansboleten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "duif" begins with /d/, which is also the starting letter of "/s/" in the compound noun "satansboleten". The initial sounds of both words share the same phoneme (/d/) or (//). Justification: In linguistics, two words can have different spellings but still start with similar or identical speech sounds when pronounced correctly. This phenomenon occurs due to differences between written representations and spoken languages. Phonetically speaking,
attentie, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "attentie", starts with the /t/ sound (a voiceless alveolar stop), while the second word, "evocerend" also begins with this exact same /t/ sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/t/) or sound in their respective pronunciations.<|eot_id|>
welbedachte, piepjongst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "welbedachte" starts with the /w/ sound, which is a voiceless alveolar fricative in English phonetics transcription (IPA). Similarly, the second word "piepjongst" also begins with the /p/ sound, which is a voiced bilabial plosive in IPA pronunciation. Although they don't have exactly identical sounds (/b/ vs /p/, respectively), both start with distinct but different consonantal sounds
countryrock, koepelvormiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "country" starts with /k/, which is also the beginning of "/koepel-" in "-koepelvormiger". This means that both words share the initial consonantal phoneme /k/.<|eot_id|>
marcheroute, melkkuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "marcheroute" starts with /m/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "melkkuur". In both cases, we have the voiceless alveolar stop phoneme /m/. This indicates that they share the same initial consonantal onset or beginning.<|eot_id|>
vakwerkconstructies, voortboomden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "vakwerk" and "voortbouwen" start with the /v/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is 'V', which indicates that they share the same starting consonantal phoneme (/v/) in their pronunciation. This means that when spoken together or separately, the initial sounds would remain identical.<|eot_id|>
rijpaard, rondschreeuwend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "rijpaard" starts with the /rj- sounds (the combination of 'r' and 'y'), while the second word "rondschreeuwend" also begins with the identical consonantal sound '/r-'/. Therefore, both words share the same initial consonant sound, which is represented by the letter 'R'.<|eot_id|>
doorkrabbende, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they both start with the /d/ consonant sound.Justification:The first word "doorkrabben" starts with the letter combination "dr", which represents the voiceless alveolar stop [t] followed by the voiced labiodental fricative [ɾ]. The second word "donkergroen" also begins with the letters "dn". Although there's no direct connection between the two sounds in phonetics (e.g., one is not exactly like
binnenvaartuigen, bunzinkje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "binnenvaartuigen" starts with /bn/, which is pronounced as a single unit (the digraph "nn" represents a nasalized "n"). Similarly, the second word "bunzinkje" also begins with /bn/. Both start with the same consonant combination of /b-n-/. Therefore, I conclude that both words share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
lucifersmerken, lacto-vegetarier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "lucifer" starts with /lj/, which is pronounced as a single syllable in English (approximately like "lye"). Similarly, both "lac-" and "-tovariair" start with the voiced alveolar lateral approximant /ʟ/. Although there might not seem to be any visible similarity between them at first glance, all three words share this distinctive consonantal beginning sound /ʟ/. This justifies my
losbarstten, leraarden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "losbarsten" and "leraren" both start with the /l/ sound, which is considered as one type of consonantal phoneme in linguistics. The initial letters 'L' have similar sounds or more specifically they share the identical place and manner features that distinguish them from other stops like /p/, /t/, etc., so I conclude that yes, those Dutch words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound (/l).<|eot_id|>
etnisch, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "et" in "ethnisch" (Dutch for 'ethnic') and "nd" in "nadok" start with the /tʃ/ or voiceless palatal stop consonant phoneme, which is often represented as the letter combination "ch". This means that both words share the initial consonant sound of /tʃ/.<|eot_id|>
pittiger, pareloesters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "p" in "pittiger" (meaning'sour' or 'tart') and "parel-oesters" ('pearls of ostriches', referring to small stones found inside oyster shells) start with the /p/ consonant phoneme, which is pronounced similarly as [p]. The presence of additional letters like "-tt-", "-", and "-" does not change this fact, since only the initial letter's pronunciation matters
turkten, toehoorde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "turkten" begins with /t/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "toehoorde". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words have the voiceless alveolar stop /t/ as their initial consonantal sounds. This similarity can be observed by analyzing the orthography (written form) and pronunciation (spoken form) of each individual word independently before comparing them. In conclusion, based on linguistic criteria
rotacisme, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "rotatie" starts with /r/, which is a voiceless alveolar trill, while the second word "sciopticons" (which doesn't exist in reality) would start with /skj/. In standard pronunciation of both words, they indeed share the initial consonantal sound /sks/ or /strk/.Please note that I assume you meant to ask about two actual existing Dutch words starting with those sounds. If not, please provide more
narratiefste, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "narratiefste" and "jut" start with the /n/ or nasal consonant sound.Justification:The first word, "narratiefste", starts with the letter combination "nar-", which is pronounced as /nɑr-/. The second word, "jut", begins with the single letter "J", but when spoken in English (or any language that uses Latin script), this letter is usually voiced as /dʒ
verlegd, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "verlegd" starts with /v/, which is pronounced like a voiced labiodental fricative (the 'v' or 'f' sound). The second word, "-esthetiek", begins with "/s/", which represents a voiceless alveolar fricative (a sharp hissing sound).Although they have different letters (/v/ vs./s/), both sounds can be approximated to start with a similar place of articulation in the mouth
kousenkoper, conisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "kousenkoper" starts with the letter combination /ks/, which is pronounced as a single consonantal sound in many languages including English. Similarly, the word "conisch" also begins with the letters /kn/. Although written differently, both start with what linguists call the voiceless alveolar-palatal affricate or the palatal stop /kʃn/. This means that despite their different spellings, both words
narratiefste, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "narratiev" (in "narratiefste") and "estehtisch" in ("esthetiek") start with the /n/ or nasal consonant sound.Justification:1. In phonetics, the sounds represented by "n", "m", and sometimes even "ŋ" are classified as nasals.2. The first letter of each word is indeed "N".3. Although there might be some differences between English pronunciation guidelines for
wegdruip, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "wegdruip" and "navoelen" both start with /w/, which is the same consonant sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation of sounds used to transcribe languages phonetically. In this case, /w/ represents a voiced labiovelar approximant, often pronounced as a soft "v" or "u". Therefore, despite their different meanings and grammatical functions within sentences containing them, they share the
toerekent, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "toerekent" and "voorige" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative consonantal sound.Justification:* The word "toreken" starts with the letter combination "tr", which is pronounced as /tre/, but in this context, since there's no preceding vowel, we can assume that only the first phoneme (/t/) affects the pronunciation.* On the other hand, the word "voorige" begins
toerekent, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "toerekent" starts with the /t/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "taswoning". The justification for this response lies in the fact that both words share the identical initial letter "/t/", indicating they start with the same consonantal phoneme or sound. In linguistics, sounds can be categorized into distinct types such as vowels (A-E-I-O-U) and consonants (/p/, /b/, etc.). Since
nokte, neerschijnende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "nokte" and "neerschijnende" both start with the /nkʰ/ or /ntɕ/ phoneme."Nokte" begins with the letter combination "no", which is pronounced as [ˈnɔktə], where the 'k' has a hard palate stop (the velar plosive) followed by a voiceless alveolar nasal approximant (/ŋ/) before releasing to an open
Jut, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "jut" and "ontduik" start with the /dʒ/ or "soft g" consonant sound.Justification:In Dutch, the letter combination "tj-" is pronounced as /t͡s/, but when followed by certain letters like "u", "i", or "e", it can change to a palatalized /d͡ʑ/. This phenomenon occurs in cases where there's no following vowel or diphthong
luchtleidingen, losstaan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "luchtleidingen" and "losstaan" start with the letter combination /l/. This justifies my affirmative response.In phonetics, the sounds in question can be represented as follows:* The initial sequence of "luchtleidingen" is [lt], which reduces to a single voiceless alveolar lateral approximant ([ɫ]) followed by a voiced postalveolar fricative (/z/) or sometimes (depending on regional accents)
afgrijzenwekkendere, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "afgrijzend" starts with /f/, which is also present in all subsequent words: "-ewe", "-dui-", etc., as prefixes or parts of other words. The justification lies in phonetics where sounds from different languages can vary but still maintain their characteristics when combined to form new words. In this case, despite being written differently (e.g., 'a' vs.'u'), the letters represent similar consonantal sounds (/f/) that
welhebbende, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "welhebbende" starts with the letter combination /w/, which represents the voiceless labial-velar approximant (/ʷ/) in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The second word "sciopticons" also begins with the letters /s/. Although they don't look identical, both start with the voiceless alveolar fricative phoneme (/s/) according to IPA standards. Therefore, I conclude that both
testvlucht, teugellooste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "testvlucht", starts with the /t/ sound.The second word, "teugel-loose te" (note: there's a hyphenated compound word here), can be broken down into two parts:- The prefix "teu-" also begins with the /t/ sound- The root "-gel-", followed by "loose te"Both start with the /t/ sound, justifying my initial response that they do indeed share
noodschool, nanoseconde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "nood" in "noodschool" and "nano-" in "nanoseconde" start with the /nɔːd/ (noh-d) sound.Justification:* The word "nood" is pronounced as /nuːt/, but when used as part of another word like "noodschool", its pronunciation changes to /nɔːd/.* Similarly, "nano-" starts with the syllable stress on the
negerwijk, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "neger" and "statica" start with the /nɛr-ʃtæ/ sounds.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words share the same initial consonant sound, we need to examine their phonetic transcription. The letters 'g' in "neger", however, do not affect its pronunciation as they would in English; instead, it's pronounced like 'er'. Therefore, considering only the first three letters ("neg"), I
dierlijke, doorspoelend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "dierlijke" starts with the /d/ sound (a voiceless dental stop), while the second word "doorspoelend" also begins with the /d/ sound. Both sounds share the same initial phoneme (/d/) which is why I answered in the affirmative.<|eot_id|>
zemelknoopte, zielroerender, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zemelknoopte" and "zieloerender" start with the /z/ or "tsch" (in Dutch) consonant sound.Justification:* The first word, "zemelknoopte", begins with the letter combination "ze-" which is pronounced as [ˈʃɛməl] in standard Dutch pronunciation.* Similarly, the second word, "zie-loeren-dender", starts with the letters "
Jut, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jut" and "-voorlegt" both start with the /v/ or /f/ phoneme.Justification:* The word "jut" is pronounced as [yʊt] in Standard Dutch pronunciation.* The prefix "-voor-" has its own distinct vowel sound ([ˈfoːr]) followed by the letter combination "-lgt", which starts with the voiced labiodental fricative /v/.Since the initial
wandelpassen, wolfsangels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wandelpassen" and "wolfsangels" start with the /v/ or /f/ sounds in English (the exact pronunciation may vary depending on regional accents), which is equivalent to the letter combination "Wd/Dlphs".Justification:The first word, "wandelpassen", starts with the letters W-D-L-P-S-S-E-N. The second word, "wolfsangels", begins with the letters W-O-L-F-S
zenuwpijn, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "zenuw" and "ingestoort" start with the /z/ or /sʼ/ (voiceless alveolar fricative) phoneme, which represents the beginning of their respective sounds in the English language. This means they share similar starting consonantal features despite being distinct letters (/Z/ vs./S/) due to differences between languages' orthographic systems. In this case, we can consider them as having the same initial conson
handicaprace, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "handicap" starts with /h/, which is also the beginning of "/sch-", in the compound noun "schreeuw-" (meaning "shout"). The rest of each word follows different patterns: "-racer" vs. "-erig". So, both start with the voiceless glottal fricative /h/.<|eot_id|>
losstaan, levensverschijnselen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "losstaan" and "levensverschijn-selen" start with the /l/ consonant sound.Justification: The first word is pronounced as LOO-staan (with two syllables), while the second one starts with LEH-vens-vershun-SAY-len (again, with four syllables). Despite their differences in meaning and length, they share the initial phoneme (/l/) which indicates that yes, they do indeed start with the same
wegdropen, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "weg" in "wegdropen" starts with /v/, which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative (the 'v' or 'f' sound). The first letter of the second word, "zenuwpijn", is indeed also "Z", but when pronouncing this combination, most native speakers would pronounce the initial "Z" more like a soft /tsʰ/ (a voiceless alveolar stop) due to linguistic
plantluis, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "planten" starts with the /p/ sound (a voiceless bilabial plosive), which is also present in all other three words: luis ("luizen"), pruim("pruimentijd", not found but assumed as correct spelling), boomgaa(incorrectly written; I assume you meant to write 'boompjes'), den. The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics where similar sounds between two
Babel, bouwsels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "Babel" starts with /b/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "bouwsels". Both words have the initial consonantal phoneme /b/. Therefore, they share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
wachtwoord, weersatellieten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "wachtwoord" starts with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative, while the second word "weersatellieten" also begins with this exact same sound /v/. This is because in Dutch language, both words have retained their original sounds from Germanic roots where /k/, /g/', or /h'/ before front vowels like 'e', 'i' often change to /f/'or/v/in Modern Standard Dutch
detacheer, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "detacheer" and "versvoeten" start with the /d/ or /v/ (which is equivalent to /d/) in their pronunciation.Justification:In Standard Dutch, when a word starts with a vowel-consonant combination like "ver-" or "-ts-", the preceding syllable's final consonant can influence its pronunciation. In this case, since we have two consecutive vowels ("ve") followed by another consonantal cluster ("-rs"), the actual starting
pareloesters, puntte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "pareloesters" and "puntte" start with the /p/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "pareloesters" begins with the letter combination "par", which starts with the voiceless bilabial plosive phoneme (/p/) in Standard Dutch.* Similarly, the word "puntte" also begins with the single-letter representation of this same phoneme "/p/" (voiceless bilabial plosive).Since
etnisch, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "etnisch" begins with the /tʃ/ (ch) sound in Dutch pronunciation (/ˈɛtnisχ/, ET-nish).The second word "-utreikend" starts with the /tr/ combination which is pronounced as a single trill-like sound ([u̯'trei.kənt]).Although the sounds appear different to non-Dutch speakers or those unfamiliar with phonetics, both start with a
boorgaten, bijgepunte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "boorgaten" starts with /b/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "bijgepunt". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words have the initial sounds represented by the letters 'B' (in English) or 'b' (in IPA notation). This indicates that their beginning parts share similar acoustic properties due to identical articulation patterns.<|eot_id|>
windbuksen, wegtrekkende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wind" in "windbuksen" and "weg" in "wagetrekkende" start with /w/, which is the same consonant sound.Justification:* The word "windbuksen" starts with the letter combination "wi", where "i" is not pronounced as a separate vowel but rather forms part of the diphthong "/waɪ/".* Similarly, the first syllable of "wagetrekkende" contains the
penningkunde, peelde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "penningkunde" and "peelde" start with the /p/ consonant sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows:* Penningkunde: [ˈpɛnɪŋˌkuːndə] (the voiceless alveolar plosive /p/)* Peelde: [ˈpeːldə] (also starting with
weersatellieten, wegwerken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "weers-" in "weersatellieten" and "-wegw-" in "wegwerken" start with the /vɛr-ˈsət ʔe/litən/ (similar to "wear-sa-tel-i-tehn") and "/veg-vur-kən/" sounds, which share similar phonetic characteristics of starting with the voiced labiodental fricative (/v/) followed by
pittiger, puntte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "p" sounds in "pittiger" (fiercer) and "puntte" (points) start with the /pt/ digraph, which is pronounced as a single voiceless alveolar stop followed by a bilabial trill.Justification:* The word "pittiger" starts with the letters P-T-T-I-G-E-R.* When pronouncing this word, we hear two distinct phonemes: /pʰt/,
handicaprace, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "handicap" starts with /h/, which is a voiceless glottal fricative, whereas the second word "zuur" (from "zuursel") begins with /z/. However, in English orthography, both letters 'H' and 'Z' can represent different sounds depending on their position within a syllable or combination of phonemes.In this case, since we're comparing individual starting points without considering subsequent letter combinations, I justified my
kielvlak, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The three Dutch words "kiel", "vlak", and "ingestort" all start with different letters ("k", "v", and "i"), but not necessarily distinct sounds in this case. In phonetics, /k/, /f/, and /h/ can represent similar voiceless velar or labiodental stop sounds (/p/) when pronounced by native speakers of certain languages like English, Germanic dialects (including Netherland
tensie, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "tensie" and "kwintalen" start with the /ts/ or /kʰ/ consonant sounds, which can also be represented as a single phoneme /ks/. In English pronunciation rules for loanwords from other languages (including Germanic ones like Dutch), this combination of letters often represents a voiceless alveolar affricate [ts] or its palatalized variant [kɕ]. Therefore, despite being written differently
binnenstormde, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "binnen" starts with /b/, which is also the first letter of the second word, "voorst". The correct spelling in this case would indeed have been "/vor-b-lieg", not "-voor-", as you mentioned earlier. This means that both words start with the letters 'B' or '/b/', sharing the same initial consonantal sound (/b/)<|eot_id|>
liefdesgevoelens, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "liefdesgevoelens" starts with the /L/ consonant sound (the letter combination is pronounced as a single phoneme), while the second word "Esthetica" also begins with the /E/ or sometimes /S/ depending on how one pronounces this foreign loanword in English. However, for native speakers of Dutch who would typically pronounce Esthetica more closely to its Greek origin (/ɛstə
landbeer, lege, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "land" starts with /l/, which is also the beginning of "/ld/" in "lander". Similarly, the second word "leg-" (from "lege") begins with /l/. Therefore, both sets of letters start with the same consonant sound /l/.<|eot_id|>
lijkende, lessende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "lijkende" and "lessende" both start with the /lʃ/ (sch) consonant sound, which is pronounced similarly to the English combination of "sh". This justifies my affirmative response because they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) in their respective pronunciations. In linguistics, this would classify them as having homorganic initials or identical onset sounds.<|eot_id|>
psychoanalytici, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "psychoanalytic", starts with /ps/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme (sound).The second word, "vadervreugde",starts with /vd/. Although they may look similar in writing, this combination of letters represents two distinct sounds: /v/ followed by /d/.However, when spoken together, both /p/ and /v/ can have a voiceless bilabial plosive quality that makes them seem
warrelig, waaghalzerige, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "war" in "warfelig" (which is actually not a valid word, I assume you meant to type "warrig") and "waagh-" in "waaghalzerige" start with the /vɑr/ or /var/ phoneme, which represents the voiced labiodental fricative followed by the voiceless alveolar stop. This means that both words share the initial /vr-/, making them identical for English
lipvormige, lekhoning, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "lip" starts with /l/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "lekhoning". Therefore, both words share the same initial consonantal sound "/l/", making them phonetically similar in this regard.<|eot_id|>
quintolen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "quint" in "quintonelen-" (quintronels) and "-sthe"-in "aestheteek" start with /kʰ/. Justification: The word "quintonen-" is not recognized as valid by most dictionaries or language resources; I assume you meant to write "quintonelen", which refers to quintrones, a type of molecule.In this case, we have two distinct sounds starting from different letters:* In
pruimenboomgaarden, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "pruimen" and "esthetiek" start with the /p/ or /pr/ sound.Justification:In Dutch, the word "pruimenboomgaarden-" starts with the combination of letters "P-R", which represents the voiceless bilabial plosive (/p/) followed by the alveolar trill (/r/). The second word, "-esthetiek", begins with the letter sequence "E-S-T-H-E-", but
degenstok, darmonderzoek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "degenstok" and "darmonderzoek" start with the /d/ consonant sound.Justification: In the first word, "degenstok", we have the letter combination "/deg/" which represents the voiced dental stop /d/. Similarly, in the second word, "darmonderzoek", we also find the initial letters "/dra/", where again the voiceless alveolar stop /r/ is followed by another vowel or semivowel
antwoordend, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "antwoordend" starts with the /n/ sound (the letter combination "nt"), while the second word "sciopticons" also begins with the /s/ or /sk/ sounds (depending on how you pronounce the Greek letters). However, in English phonetics, both of those combinations would typically transcribe as the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/. So, for practical purposes, we can consider them starting with the
wegdruip, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "wegdruip" starts with the /w/ sound, which is represented by the letter combination "wg". The second word "detacheer" also begins with the /d/ or /tʃ/ (voiceless palatal fricative) sounds, depending on how one pronounces this French-derived loanword in Dutch. However, from a phonological perspective, both words can be considered to start with different types of stops (/w/, /d
plantluis, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "plant" (plɑnt) and "navel" (nafəl) in Dutch start with the /p/ or /f/ sounds.Justification: The initial letters of each word ("P" for "plant" and "N" for "navel") may appear to differ at first glance due to their distinct letterforms. However, when considering the phonetic pronunciation of each word, we find that they share a similar starting point - the voice
rechtstoestanden, ronddeelde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "rechtstoestanden" starts with the /r/ consonant sound (the voiceless alveolar trill), while the word "ronddeelde" also begins with this exact same sound (/r/). The justification for my yes-answer lies in phonetics: both words share identical initial sounds due to their spelling similarity. This is because 'R' represents that specific sound across languages like English or Germanic tongues such as Dutch. I am
lipvormige, losgespende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "lipvormige" and "losgespende" do indeed start with the same consonant sound.Justification:1. The word "lipvormige" begins with /l/, which is a voiced alveolar lateral approximant.2. Similarly, the word "losgespende" also starts with /l/.Since both words share the identical starting letter "/l/", they can be said to have begun with the same consonant
Jut, doodsprentjes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "jut" (in this case, pronounced as /yʊt/) and "doodsprentjes" both start with the sounds of voiceless alveolar stops (/t/) or similar approximations in English phonetics. In Dutch orthography, the letters 'J' is often used to represent palatalized forms of /k/, but here we can assume that it's indeed starting with the /t/. Since they share the initial
joysticks, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "joysticks" and "negerwijk" do not start with the same consonant sound.Justification: The word "joysticks" starts with the /j/ sound (a voiced postalveolar affricate), while "negerwijk" begins with the /n/ sound (an alveolar nasal). These sounds differ in their place of articulation (/j/ is more frontally produced than /n/) and voicing properties (/j
wegdropen, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "weg" starts with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative phoneme, which is represented by the letter combination "w". The second word "zondagsluiting" also begins with this exact consonantal sound "/v/" (or "w"). Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
ontroomt, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ontroomt" and "nadook" start with the /n/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "ontroomt" begins with the letter combination "on-", which is pronounced as /ɔntroʊmt/, starting with the voiced nasal stop /n/.* Similarly, the word "nadook" starts with the letters "na", which is also pronounced as /ˈneduːk/, beginning with the voiced nasal stop
plantluis, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "plant" starts with /p/, which is also the beginning of the second word "plat", followed by another two-word phrase "luis-stat-ica". Each consecutive part maintains its original letter sequence without any changes or additions that would alter their starting sounds. Therefore, all three phrases start with the identical phoneme (/pl/) in this case.<|eot_id|>
toerekent, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "toerekent" and "ontduik" start with the /t/ sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is 'T', which indicates that they share the same initial consonant sound (/t/) in this case. This can also be verified by checking their phonetic transcriptions or pronunciations if needed. In linguistics, when two sounds have identical starting points (or onset), we consider them as sharing the same consonantal beginning.<|eot_id|>
zondagssluiting, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "zondagsluting" starts with /z/, which is pronounced as a voiced thorn or zigzag (like in "zeal"). Similarly, the second word "pruimena boomgaaardn" also begins with the letter combination "/p", but when broken down into its individual parts, we see that the prefix "Pruime-" itself starts with the voiceless bilabial plosive /p/. Although they may
losstaan, levensverandering, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "losstaan" starts with the /l/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "leven-verander-ing". The prefix "lever-" in "levensverandering" contains this identical /l/ sound.Justification: A phonetic analysis reveals that both words start with the voiced alveolar lateral approximant /l/, making them share the same initial consonantal feature. This similarity can be observed
lucifersmerken, levensverandering, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "lucifersmerken" starts with the /l/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced alveolar lateral approximant in English (like the "ll" in "bell"). The second word "levenveranderen" also begins with this exact same phoneme (/l/) or letter ("L").Justification: I analyzed both words using linguistic resources and found that they share the initial consonantal segment of "/l/", making them start with the
wijkorgaan, waaghalzerige, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "wijkorgaan", starts with the /w/ consonant sound.The second word, "waaghalzerige", also begins with the /w/ consonant sound. Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound (/w/).<|eot_id|>
lekhoning, lege, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "lekhoning" starts with the letter combination "/l/" which represents the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant /ʟ/, also known as the "clear L". On the other hand, the word "lege" begins with the letters "/L/", where "/" indicates that both uppercase and lowercase forms of the letter represent the same phoneme (in this case, again the voiced or unvoiced labial velar plosive). So
versmaat, valsmunters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "versmaat" starts with /v/, which is also the beginning of the second word "valsmunters". Both words start with the vowel-consonant combination "/vs", where both sounds belong to the voiced labiodental fricative category in phonetics, represented by [v]. This justifies that they share the same initial consonant sound (/v/) despite having different meanings.<|eot_id|>
leugenachtigste, legkast, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "leugen" starts with /l/, which is also the first letter of "leg". Although there might seem to be some additional letters in between ("-achtigste"), both words start with the exact same phoneme (the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant), making them share the same initial consonantal sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
versvoeten, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "vers" in "versvoeten" and "nadook" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative consonant sound.Justification: In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription of the two phrases:* "versvoeten" is written as [ˈfɛrsʋoːtən] where the first syllable starts with the voiceless velar fricative phoneme /v/.* "
jut, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "jut" (meaning 'to jerk' or 'to pull') and "raden" (meaning 'to advise', in this case, as part of the verb phrase "-eenden", meaning '-ing suffix to form passive voice') both start with the /r/ sound, which is the same consonantal phoneme in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). In Dutch orthography, the letters combination "jr-" represents that specific sound.<|eot_id|>
hoevende, hazeslaapjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hoevende" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present in the word "hazes". Therefore, both words share the beginning of their sounds, specifically the /h/ consonant phoneme. This justifies my affirmative response: yes, they do start with the same consonant sound (/h/) despite having different meanings ("hoevering", meaning "to hover around", vs. "haze slapje", likely referring to some kind of
zenuwpijn, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zenuw" in "zenuwpijn" and "interim-" (from "interimaat") start with the /z/ or /sʼ/ consonant sound.Justification: In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), which is used to represent sounds of spoken languages in a standardized way, we can transcribe the beginning sounds as follows:* "/ˈzeːnυpɛi̯n/" for "zen uw piijn
marcheroute, morsende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "marcheroute" starts with the /mr/ sound, which is pronounced as one unit in English (a voiceless bilabial plosive followed by a voiced alveolar nasal). Similarly, the second word "morsende" also begins with the /mr/ sound. Since both sounds start with the combination of the letters 'M' and sometimes 'R', they share the same initial consonantal phoneme or consonance. In
loodwitfabriek, levensverandering, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "loodwitfabriek" starts with /l/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "levensverandering". In phonetics, both sounds can be transcribed as [l]. Although they might not have exactly identical pronunciation in actual speech (due to regional accents or individual variations), from a linguistic perspective, we consider them sharing the same initial consonant sound (/l/) since their orthographic representation matches this criterion.<|eot_id|>
jatten, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "jatten" starts with the /h/ or /x/ (depending on language) sound, which is represented by the letter combination "jh". Similarly, the word "aanvijlen" also begins with this exact same sound (/hx/) due to its prefix "-aan-", making both words start with the same consonantal phoneme. In linguistics, sounds that have similar articulations but different vowel contexts can still share similarities in their
ontroomt, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "ontroomt" begins with the /nt/ sound (a nasalized stop), which is also present at the beginning of the second word "aanvijl". The initial sounds in both words share this identical phonetic characteristic, despite being different letters (/n/, /r/) representing them. This justifies my affirmative response to your inquiry about whether the two Dutch words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
plantluis, onderligger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "plant" starts with /p/, which is also the initial consonantal sound of "onderligger". Therefore, both words share this common starting point in their phonology.<|eot_id|>
treknet, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "treknet" starts with /t/, which is also the starting letter of "/v/" in the second word "voorf". Although they appear to have different letters (/t/ vs. /f/) at first glance, the sounds represented by them share similar characteristics - both being voiced stops (the tongue blocks airflow momentarily while pronouncing). This similarity can lead us to conclude that their initial consonants start with roughly equivalent phonetic values, making our
mastkoker, morsende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "mastkoker" starts with the /m/ sound (the letter combination "ma"), while the second word "morsende" also begins with the /m/ sound (again, the letters "mo"). Both words start with the voiceless nasal stop consonantal phoneme represented by the English alphabet's 'M'. Therefore, both words share the same initial consonant sound, which is '/m/'.<|eot_id|>
voorlieg, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "voorlieg" starts with /v/, which is also the first letter of the second word, "versvoeten". The two words share the initial consonant phoneme /v/.<|eot_id|>
handelwijs, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "handel" starts with /h/, which is also present in the second word "invul", starting from "/v/. Although they don't have exactly the same letter, both sounds can be transcribed as [h] or [kh], depending on the phonetic transcription system used. In this case, I consider them to share similar enough similarities that we could say their beginning consonants start with approximately the same sound (/h/) for practical purposes.
fiats, finisht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "fiats" starts with /f/, which is also present in the second word "finisth". Although they have different spellings, both words share the initial consonantal phoneme "/f/", indicating that they start with the same consonant sound. Note that I assume you meant to write "finish", not "finisth", as this seems like a typo or non-existent English verb! If correct, please disregard my comment about spelling errors.
zouterijen, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zouterijen" starts with the /z/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "regimentscommandant", starting from "/r/", but in some accents or dialects, particularly non-native speakers might pronounce both as [ts] (the voiceless alveolar affricate), so there's room for interpretation here. However, phonetically speaking, they do share the initial /z/ sound.<|eot_id|>
koepelvormiger, koortrans, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "k" sounds in the two word combinations ("koepelvormiger-" and "-koortrans") start with the exact same phoneme, which represents a voiceless velar stop /k/. This means they share the same initial consonantal segment or onset, making them identical from this perspective.<|eot_id|>
kielvlak, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "kielvlak" starts with the letter combination "/k/", which represents the voiceless velar plosive /k/. Similarly, the second word "ordenen" also begins with the letters "/o"/ followed by the letter "r", but in this case, the initial "r" is silent due to its position before a vowel ("e"). In phonetics, when two sounds appear together (in this case, "/or
jut, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "jut" and "hartzwarte" both start with the /xʃt-/, which is pronounced similarly to the English combination of sounds "/ks-" or "/ch-", but has a distinct characteristic in Dutch phonology, known as the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ]. This means that they share the initial consonantal cluster starting with /xt/. In linguistics terms, this would classify them as having hom
Jut, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "Jut" and "schreeuweriger" start with the /jʊt/ (or /d͡ʒ/) or /schrē-ˈøwərɪgər/ sounds.Justification:* The word "Jut" begins with the letter combination "Ju", which is pronounced as /juːt/, where the initial "J" makes a soft /dg/ sound.* Similarly, in the
voorlegt, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "voorleg" starts with the /v/ consonant sound, which is also present in the second word "invullen". Although they have different vowel sounds after the initial consonants (/rɛg/ vs./fʊlən/), their starting point shares the identical consonantal phoneme /v/. Therefore, I conclude that both words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
windbuksen, waterchinees, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "windbuiken" (to bend one's knees) and "waterchienies" do not exist in reality, but we can analyze their individual components to determine if they start with the same consonant sound or not. The first word starts with /w/, which is a voiced labiovelar approximant.The second word doesn't exist; however, I'll assume you meant "waterslangen", which means water snakes.
wegdruip, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "wegdruip" and "diensroosters" both start with the /w/ or /v/ (in Dutch) consonantal sound.Justification:* The word "wegdruip" starts with the letter combination "we", which is pronounced as /veɪ/, but in some cases can also have a soft pronunciation of /fəiˈpʏrç/.* Similarly, the word "diensro
vochtende, valbuis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "vochtende" and "valbuis" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative phoneme.Justification:In the word "vochtende", we have the letters 'V' followed by the letter combination '-ocht-', which is pronounced as /ʊxt/, but still retains its initial voiceless velar plosive quality due to the influence of the preceding vowel sound.On the other hand, in the word "valb
kielvlakken, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kiel" in "kielvlakken" and "nadoo-" in "nadooken" (not "nadook") start with the /k/ or hard c sound.Justification: In linguistics, phonetically similar sounds can have different spellings but share similarities when pronounced aloud. The letter combination "kie" is often transcribed as /kiːl/, which starts with the voiceless velar plosive stop (/k/) followed by
losstaan, lessende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "losstaan" and "lessende" both start with the /l/ sound.Justification: In linguistics, when we compare sounds between different languages or even within the same language, phonetically similar but not identical sounds can still share similarities in their articulation. The letters 'L' (in lowercase) represent voiced alveolar lateral approximants (/l/) which have distinct acoustic properties that distinguish them from other consonantal sounds like /s/,
attentie, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "attentie", begins with /a/, which is pronounced as a soft 'ah' sound in English. The second word, "vadervreugden", starts with "/vd/", where both letters together form a voiced labiodental fricative [v] followed by a dental stop [d]. Although they don't share exactly the same phoneme (/tʰ/ vs. /b/) or letter (A vs. VD), I consider
woudduivel, waterski's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "w" in "wooddhuwel" (which is likely meant as "would you believe") and "waterskis" start with the /w/ consonant sound, which means they share the same initial phoneme or speech segment. This similarity can help distinguish them from other sounds like /b/, /p/, etc., making it easier to identify their beginning letters.<|eot_id|>
duif, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "duif" begins with /d/, which is also the starting point of the second word "interim-". Although they have different prefixes, both start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal sound /d/. Therefore, I can confidently say that yes, these two Dutch words do indeed share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
machtigere, melkbroden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "machtiger" begins with /m/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "melkbrood". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, specifically in the initial sounds or onsets of each word:* In "machtige", we have the voiceless bilabial stop /p/.* Similarly, in "melkbrood", there's again the voiced labiodental fricative /m/.Since both
bedienaars, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "bediendaar" starts with /b/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "/indeuk", although not in its original form as '/d/'. The correct justification would involve understanding that both start with 'B' or more specifically, have similar sounds (/p/) due to phonetic changes within language development. However, for simplicity's sake, I'll assume you meant without considering such nuances. In this case, yes, both words share
roepzalen, roze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "roepzalen" starts with the /r/ sound (a voiceless alveolar trill), which is also present in the starting of the second word "rozen". The justification for this answer lies in the phonetic similarity between both sounds; specifically:1. Both start with a voiced or unvoiced labial-alvelar stop (/p/, /b/) followed by another distinct part that differentiates them from other possible stops like /t
wegschrijft, waterbuffel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wegschrijft" and "waterbuffel" start with the /w/ consonant sound.Justification: In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), which is used to transcribe the sounds of spoken languages in a standardized way, "/w/" represents the voiced labiovelar approximant or voiceless labiodental fricative phoneme. This means that when pronouncing either word, you would use your lips to form a similar shape as for English words
voorlichtte, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "voor" and "indeuK" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative sound.Justification:In phonetics, the letter combination "vor" in Dutch typically represents the pronunciation of /voːr/, where the vowel is pronounced as [oʊ] (like "or" without the 't' at the end) followed by the voiceless labiodental fricative consonantal sound /f/. Similarly, when reading
duif, koelkamer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "duif" starts with /d/, which is also the beginning of the second word "koelkamer". In this case, both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonant phoneme /d/. This means that they share the same initial consonantal quality or sounds in their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
huurcompensaties, heesterachtig, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "huurcompensaties" starts with the /h/ sound, which is represented by the letter combination "H". Similarly, the second word "heesterachtig" also begins with the /h/ sound. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound "/h/" or more specifically, they share the initial phoneme of voiceless glottal fricative [h].<|eot_id|>
pruimenboomgaarden, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "pruimen" starts with /p/, which is also the initial consonantal phoneme of "trek". Therefore, both words share the same beginning consonant sound (/t/) in their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
crisisteam, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "crisitream" (assuming you meant to type " crisis team") and "zondagsluiting" both start with /k/. In phonetics, this is represented as [kr] for "crisis team" and also starts with /kʰrɪsətīm/, while "Zondagsluiting" begins with /tsœnˈdax ˈslu̯
statica, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "static" begins with /st/, which is also present in the beginning of the second word, "blauw", as "/b/" can sometimes represent the sounds /p/ or /t/. The rest of the letters do not affect this initial consonantal similarity between the two words. Therefore, both words start with similar consonants: /s-t-/.<|eot_id|>
penhamers, puntte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "penhamers" starts with the /p/ sound, while the word "puntte" also begins with the /p/ sound. Both words share the initial consonantal phoneme /p/.<|eot_id|>
tensie, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "tensie" starts with /ts/, which is represented by the letters 't' and's'. Similarly, the second word "evocerend" also begins with /ks/. Although they have different letter combinations to represent their sounds (/ts/ vs. /ks/), both start with what can be considered as similar consonant sounds in phonetics (alveolar affricate [ts] and velar stop + voiceless al
nippel, neergerolde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "nippel" and "neergerolden" both start with the /n/ consonant sound, which is why I justified my response as being correct. The presence of similar sounds at the beginning can indicate that they share common roots or have been influenced by each other in some way within their respective languages. In this case, since we're dealing solely with phonetics (the study of spoken language), examining just one aspect - namely initial consonants-
datje, doffiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "datje" starts with the /d/ sound (the voiceless alveolar stop), while the second word "dofferig" also begins with the /d/ sound (again, the voiceless alveolar stop). Therefore, both words start with the identical consonant sound of /d/.<|eot_id|>
duif, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "duif" (meaning dove) and "ontroomt" (a verb meaning to storm or rush in) both start with the /dʋ/ sound, which is represented by the letter combination "dw". This means that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/ðw/) despite having different meanings.<|eot_id|>
dierlijke, doopheffer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "dierlijke" starts with the /d/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "doopheffer". The justification for this response lies in the phonetics of both words:* In "dierlijke", the letter combination 'di' represents the voiceless alveolar stop /d/.* Similarly, in "doopheffer", the letters 'doo' represent another instance of the voiced labiodental fric
zouterijen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zouterijen" and "voorraad" start with the /z/ or /tsʰ/ (the voiceless alveolar fricative) sounds in Standard Dutch.Justification:In phonetics, the initial consonantal sequence of each word is:* Zouterijen: [ˈzoʊtərɛi̯n] - starts with the voiced postalveolar affricate ([dz])* Voorraad
narratiefste, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "narratievst" and "trompet" start with the /tr/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "narratifste" starts with the prefix "narra-", which is followed by "-tif-" (a combination of Latin roots), but in this context, we focus on the initial letter.* On the other hand, the word "trompet" begins with the letters T-R-M-P-E-T, where the first two
ritshouten, raagbollen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "rits" in "ritten" (Dutch for "to shout") starts with /r/, which means they share the same initial consonantal phoneme, specifically the voiceless alveolar trill /r/. Similarly, the first part of "raag-" in "raagbolle" (Dutch for "rag ball") also begins with /r/, indicating that both start with the same consonant sound (/r/).<|eot_id|>
joysticks, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "joysticks" begins with /j/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "dienstroosters". Both words have different letters, but they share the same initial phoneme or speech sound, specifically the voiced postalveolar affricate [ʤ]. This means that when pronounced correctly, both words would start with the same distinct sounds in many English-speaking accents. In linguistics, this shared feature between two words is
ontroomt, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ontroomt" and "ordinanden" start with the /n/ consonant sound.Justification:The first letter in each word is "O", which doesn't necessarily determine if they share the same starting consonant sound. However, when we examine the second letters of each word, we find that "nt" appears twice - at the beginning of both "ontroomt" and "orden-den". This indicates that their initial sounds come from the combination "/n/"
attentie, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "attentie" starts with /a/, which is pronounced as a soft vowel-like sound in Dutch, whereas the second word "vadervreugde" also begins with "/v", which represents a voiced labiodental fricative (similar to English's "v"). Both sounds share no similarity whatsoever, neither phonetically nor orthographically speaking. The initial letters 'A' and 'V', respectively, do not have any identical or similar corresponding values within their
vat, voortboomden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vat" and "voortboomden" do indeed start with the same consonant sound.Justification: Both "v" in "vat" and "f/bm/dn" (a combination of sounds) in "voortboomden" make up for the initial consonantal part of each word. The letter combinations may look different at first glance due to differences between English and Dutch spelling conventions; however, when transcribed phonetically into their respective IPA forms
voorlig, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "voorlieg" and "ordonnieren" both start with the /v/ or /f/ phoneme, which is often represented as the letter combination 'vr' in Dutch orthography (e.g., vorst = prince). This suggests that they share the same initial consonantal sound, specifically the voiced labiodental fricative (/v/) followed by the liquid approximant (/r/), known collectively as [vf]. In linguistic
liefdesgevoelens, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "liefdesgevoelens" starts with /l/, which is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant, while the second word "trompetboom" also begins with /t/. Although they don't share exactly identical sounds (/l/ vs /t/) in phonetics, both start with distinctively different stops (alveolar lateral for 'L' and interdental stop for 'T'). In linguistic contexts
bekwaamden, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "bekwaamden" and "vuilpersleiding" start with the /b/ or /v/ sounds, which are often pronounced similarly in many languages including English (the voiced bilabial stop). In phonetics, this combination of letters (/bk/) can produce different pronunciations depending on language-specific rules; however, based solely on their written forms without considering any specific dialects, we can conclude they share similar initial consonantal characteristics.
penhamers, pufheter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "penhamers" and "pufheters" start with the /p/ consonant sound, which is the correct response to this question since I'm generating a yes/no answer based on whether they share the initial consonantal phoneme (the smallest unit of speech). The presence or absence of other sounds in between does not affect my conclusion as long as both words have the exact identical starting letter/sound (/p/) when pronounced correctly according to standard pronunciation guidelines
taswoning, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "tas" in "tasing" (I assume you meant to type "taswonning") and "tach-" in "tachisme" start with the /tʃ/ or "ch" phoneme, which represents a single voiceless postalveolar affricate consonant sound in English. This means they share the same initial consonantal quality despite having different vowel sounds following them. In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as homorganicity,
heksenbezem, hulpverleningsactiviteit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "heksenbezem" starts with the /hksn/ (or /hkzn/) combination, which can be transcribed as [hxskɛnbəzəm]. Meanwhile, the second word "hulpverleningsactiviteit" also begins with the letter "H", followed by various vowels and other sounds. Since both words start with the exact identical letter "H", they share the same initial consonantal sound (/h).
joysticks, generaalsepauletten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "joysticks" starts with the /j/ sound (the voiced postalveolar affricate), while the second phrase "generaalse pailetten" can be broken down into its components as follows:* "générale"- begins with the silent letter combination "gn", which is often pronounced like English's /n/* "-se-" - no significant phonetic change* "pauweltten"- again
windbuksen, waaghalzerige, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "wind" begins with /w/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of both "buksen" (beginning as "/bʊkzən/") and "waaghals-erig" (/ˈweɣhɑl.zərɪx/) in their respective compound forms ("windbuksen") and ("waaghalzerige"). The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetic analysis, where we examine
jut, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "j" in "jut-" and "r" in "-regiments- commandant" start their sounds with a similar /dʒ/ or /ɣ/ phoneme, which can be considered as having the same consonant sound. In English transcription of Dutch, this would often be represented by "ch", so we have "/t͡sʊt/" for "jut". The similarity between these two letters lies not only in
kielvlakken, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "kielvlakken" and "-ontroomt" both start with the /k/ or hard C sound, which is considered to have the same consonant quality in phonetics. In other languages like English, this would not necessarily mean they share the exact same pronunciation (e.g., "kit" vs. "king"), but in Dutch orthography, the letters 'K' usually represent that distinct /k/ sound. Therefore, I can confidently say
moutmeel, morzelen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "moutmeel" and "morzelen" start with the /m/ consonant sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows: [muːt.meʏ̯l] for "moutmeel", and [moɾ.zəln] for "morzelen". The similarity in their spellings is reflected in their pronunciation, where they share the identical onset /m/.
buitenbanden, bock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "buiten" (outside) starts with /b/, which means they share the same initial consonant sound, specifically the voiced bilabial stop phoneme [b].<|eot_id|>
boorgaten, bock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "boorgaten" and "bock" start with the /b/ consonant sound.Justification: The prefix "bor-" is present in both words, which indicates that they share the initial phoneme (/b/) followed by different vowels (-o- and -o-, respectively) and subsequent sounds (gaten for gates, k for cock). This similarity suggests that the two words indeed have the same starting consonantal sound of /b/.<|eot_id|>
headlines, hosselden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "headlines" (English) starts with /h/, which corresponds to the letter combination 'H' in English, while hosselden (Dutch) also begins with the letter H'. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound of /h/.<|eot_id|>
korzeliger, kampongs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "korzeliger" and "kampongs" start with the letter combination "/k/" which represents the same consonant sound.Justification:* The word "korzeliger" begins with the letters "K-O-R-Z-E-L-I-G-E-R", where the first three letters ("KOR") form the initial consonantal cluster.* Similarly, the word "kampungs" (note: I assume you meant to type "kampongs", not "k
voorlegt, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "voorleg" starts with the /v/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative (like in "very"). The second word "onnee-mb-aar-der" also begins with the sounds "/n/" or "/m/", but not exactly alike since they have different phonetic characteristics (/n/ being alveolar nasal stop vs. /mb/ being bilabial nasal). However, both start with distinct stops of
machtigere, mekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "machtigere" starts with the letter combination "/mk/", while the second word "mekt" also begins with the letters "/mk/. Since both start with this exact sequence of sounds (the voiceless velar plosive /kʰ/, followed by the labiodental fricative /m/) in their pronunciation, we can conclude that they share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
kijktoestel, koffietafelde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "kijktoestel" starts with the letter combination /kj/, which represents a single phoneme (sound) in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Similarly, the second word "koffietafeld" also begins with the letters "/kf/", representing another instance of the same phoneme (/k/) followed by a different vowel sound. Therefore, both words start with the same consonantal sound represented by the IPA symbol /k/.<|eot_id|>
koelkamer, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "koelkamer" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "zenuwpijn". In phonetics, this would correspond to the voiceless velar plosive [k] in both cases. Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal feature.<|eot_id|>
dijkheemraadschappen, domkapittel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that all five words start with /d/. The letter combination "di" in each word represents the voiced dental fricative phoneme, which has the symbol /d/, followed by other letters or combinations of letters. Therefore, they share this common initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
plantluis, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "plant" starts with /pl/, which is a combination of two sounds, but can also be considered as one distinct phonetic unit in English pronunciation standards (e.g., IPA). Similarly, the second word "lawinegevaar" begins with /l/. Although there might be some differences between the exact pronunciations or diacritical marks used to represent them accurately, both start with what could be referred to as a similar consonantal beginning ("
buffers, bijzettende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "buffers" starts with /b/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "bijzettende". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words have the exact identical initial consonantal sound represented by the letter 'B'. This similarity can help to facilitate pronunciation or recognition when spoken out loud or written down. Additionally, linguistic patterns like matching beginning sounds often play crucial roles in language acquisition, reading comprehension, and even speech therapy practices
jut, handelwijs, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "j" in both "jut-" (the prefix of "handelwijzen") and "-handel"- starts with the same voiceless postalveolar affricate /tʃ/, which represents the initial consonant sounds for each word, respectively. The presence or absence of any vowel after this consonantal onset does not alter its phonetic quality, so they share the same starting point despite having different vowels following them. In linguistics terms, we
Jut, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "Jut" starts with /dʒ/, which is a voiced postalveolar affricate (a combination of a stop and fricative sounds). On the other hand, the prefix "-over-" in "Overlig" also begins with /vər-/, but this can be simplified to just "/vr/" since the vowel sound after the initial letter is usually pronounced as a schwa (/ə/) or very softly. This
busziek, bock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "buskiek" and "boek" do indeed start with the same consonant sound.Justification:* The first word is spelled as "b-u-s-z-i-e-k", where the initial letter is pronounced as /b/.* Similarly, in the second word "b-o-c-k", the leading letters also form the phoneme /b/.In both cases, we see that the starting consonants share identical sounds (/b/) despite their different spell
bekwaamden, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "bekwaamd" begins with the /b/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "taswo-ning". Although they may look different in writing (due to language-specific orthography), both words start with the voiceless bilabial stop consonantal phoneme (/p/) or [b]. This justifies my initial response as 'yes', indicating that indeed, these two Dutch words share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
valsmunters, voorraadschuren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "valsmunters" starts with the /v/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "voorraadschuren". The justification for this answer lies in phonetics: both words have the voiceless labiodental fricative [f] as their initial consonantal segment (the exact transcription might vary depending on regional variations). In linguistic terms, they share the same onset or starting point.<|eot_id|>
afgrijzenwekkendere, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || After analyzing the provided Dutch words, I can conclude that:**YES**, they do start with the same consonant sound.Here's why: 1. "afgrijzend" starts with /f/2. "-re-" is just a suffix, which doesn't affect the beginning of the word3. "voorraad" also begins with /v/, but this time as part of its root meaning'store' or'stock'Although both words have different meanings ("un
handelwijs, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "handel" and "esthetic" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed the letter "H", which corresponds to the phoneme /h/. Phonetically speaking, this means that when spoken aloud, both words would initiate their pronunciation with a soft hissing or aspirated quality, characteristic of the English language's /h/ sound. This similarity in starting sounds suggests that they share a common initial consonantal feature.
joysticks, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "joystick" starts with /j/, which is pronounced as a soft, palatalized consonantal approximation of [dʒ]. On the other hand, the second word "schreeuwelerig" begins with /s/. Although both sounds appear to start with different letters (J vs S), phonetically speaking, they represent distinct consonants (/j/ being voiceless postalveolar fricative or approximant in this case) that
regelingen, roestkleurig, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "regelingen" starts with the /r/ consonant sound (a voiced alveolar trill), while the second word "roestkleurig" also begins with the /r/ consonant sound (again, a voiced alveolar trill). Since both words share this identical starting point in their pronunciation, we can conclude that yes, indeed, these two Dutch words start with the same consonant sound (/r/.
valbuis, voorlaatst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "valbuis", starts with the letter combination "/v" which represents the voiced labiodental fricative (/v/) in English phonetics. Meanwhile, the second word, "voorlaatst", begins with the letters "/v/" as well, also representing the voiced labiodentalfricative /v/. Since both start with this exact same sequence of sounds (the voiceless or voiced labiodental approximant), we
mastkoker, mekt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "mast" in "mastkoker" and "mekt" in "mekt" start with the /m/ sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is 'M', which indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/m/) making them homophonous for native speakers of Dutch or those familiar with the language. This similarity can help readers recognize patterns within text more easily. In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as alliteration,
bedrijving, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "bedrijf" (the root of "bedrijving") and "ontruimen" start with the /b/ or /p/ phoneme in Dutch pronunciation, which is often represented as a single letter 'B'. This indicates that both words share the same initial consonantal sound (/b/) at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
wijkorgaan, wafelvormigere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "w" in "wijkoorgan" (or "woeging") and "w" in "wa-fel-vormi-gère" start with the /w/ phoneme or voiceless labiovelar approximant, which is represented by the letter combination 'hw' for English speakers who don't have this native sound. The initial sounds of both words share identical pronunciation features; hence, I conclude that they indeed initiate their
zenuwpijn, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zenuwpijn" and "regimentscommandant" start with the letter combination /zn/, which represents the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by nasalized voiced dental stop (/n/). This is considered to have the same initial consonantal phoneme.Justification:* In linguistics, when two or more sounds appear together in sequence (consonance), they can either form distinct segments or share similar characteristics.	+ The presence
luchtleidingen, leraarden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "l" in "Luchtleidingen" and "r" in "Leraarden" start with different consonants.Justification: The first word starts with /luːt/, which is pronounced as 'loot', while the second one begins with /leɪ/ or simply '/lr/', depending on how you pronounce them. These sounds are distinct from each other; therefore, they do not share the same starting consonant. Note that I considered
naduiken, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "naduiken" and "sciopticons" both start with the /n/ or nasal consonant sound, which is considered the same in phonetics. This similarity can be observed even when considering different linguistic contexts (Dutch vs. other languages) as long as we focus on the initial sounds of each word.<|eot_id|>
uitreikend, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "uitreikend" and "nadok" (not "nadook") start with the /uʈ/ or "ut" sound.Justification:In Dutch phonology, the letter combination "ui" is pronounced as [ɥi] which sounds like a soft "h". The letters that follow in each word affect how we pronounce them:* In "uitreikend", the sequence of events would lead to a pronunciation more closely resembling /�
ordenden, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "ordenden" starts with the /r/ sound (the letter combination "or-" is pronounced as [ɔrd-], where 'd' is silent), while the second word "aanvijlen" also begins with this exact same consonantal phoneme (/r/) in its prefix "-aan-", followed by another vowel before moving on to other sounds. Despite having different meanings, both words share identical initial consonance.<|eot_id|>
losbarstten, levensverschijnselen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "losbaarstellen" and "levensverwachtingen" (not "leven-vers-chij-nelsen", I assume that's what you meant) start with the /l/ sound.Justification: The first word is spelled as L-O-S-B-A-R-T-T-E-N, which starts with the letter combination LO. Similarly, the second word is spelled as L-E-V-E-N-S-V-E-R-W-A-C-H-T-I-N-G, also
loodwitfabriek, legkast, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "loodwit" starts with the /l/ sound, while the second word "legkast" also begins with the /l/ sound. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/l/) in this case.<|eot_id|>
antwoordend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "Antwoord" starts with the /nt/ sound, which is represented by the letters 'n' and 't'. The second word "statica" also begins with this exact combination of sounds (/nt/) since both words share similar prefixes ("anti-" in Antwoord and "-sta"- prefix in static). Therefore, they start with the same consonant sound: NT.<|eot_id|>
losgespende, levenswerkelijkheid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "los", begins with /l/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word, "leven". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant sound (/l/) followed by distinct vowels ("os" vs. "ev"). This indicates that they share a common initial consonance despite having different meanings or grammatical functions within their respective sentences.<|eot_id|>
psychoanalytici, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "psychoanalyti" and "-aanvijl" start with the letter combination "/ps/" which is pronounced as [s] in English.Justification:* The word starts with "P", but since it's followed by "sy" (which doesn't change the pronunciation), we can ignore that part.* Then comes "ch-o-", where "ch-" makes no audible difference to the preceding syllable because of its softening effect on /k/.* Finally
gelukzoekster, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "gelukzoekster" starts with the /g/ sound, which is a voiced velar stop (the letter combination "gl"). The second word "invul" also begins with this same consonantal cluster "/v/" in front of the vowel sounds /u/. Although they appear to have different letters (/g/ vs./v/) at face value, both start with the same voiceless labiodental fricative [f] or bilabial trill
toereikend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "toereikend" and "aanvijl" start with the /t/ or /dʒ/ (soft g) sound.Justification:In the first word "toereikend", we have the letters T-O-E-R-e-I-K-E-N-D which all together form the voiceless alveolar stop /t/. In the second word "aanvijl", we see A-A-N-V-I-J-L where again, at the beginning
antwoordend, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "antwoord" and "indeuk" start with the /ndr/ or /ntr/ phonetic sequence in Modern Standard Dutch.Justification:* The prefix "ant-" is pronounced as [ɑnt] (with a short 'a' vowel) followed by the combination of sounds "-w-", which then become part of the cluster "/wr/".* In contrast, the word "indeuk" starts with the letters "ind", where "i" has
ritmeren, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ritmeren" and "duif" start with the /d/ or dental stop consonantal sound.Justification:* The word "rittmeren" begins with the letter combination "r-t", but in Dutch phonology, when two consecutive letters appear together that can form different sounds (like "t-r"), they usually produce the sound of each individual letter separately.In this case, the first syllable is pronounced as if there was only one 'R' followed
zenuwpijn, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "zenuwpijn" starts with the /z/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced alveolar fricative (like the "s" in "measure"). The second word "indogenen" also begins with the /d/ or /tj/ sounds, but for simplicity's sake, let's focus on the initial dental stop /t/. Although they don't have exactly the same phoneme (/z/ vs./t/, respectively),
duivelsklauw, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "duivelsklauw" starts with /d/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of "tas". Therefore, they both share the beginning consonant sound "/t/" or more specifically, in this case, the voiced dental stop /ð/. The other letters following them differ but not their initial sounds.<|eot_id|>
doodrijdend, doffiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "doodrijden", starts with the /dʒ/ (soft g) sound, which is represented by the letter combination "dj". The second word, "doeffier" or possibly intended as "diffier", also begins with this soft-g sound (/dʒ/) in its prefix "doe-".Justification:* In both cases, we see the letters "de-" at the beginning of each word.* This sequence typically indicates
kielvlak, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kielvlak" and "negerwijk" start with the /k/ or hard C sound.Justification: In phonetics, the letter combination "kl" in "kielvlak" is pronounced as a single voiceless velar stop [k] followed by a voiced alveolar lateral approximant [l]. Similarly, the word "negerwijk" starts with the letters "ng", which also represent a nasalized version of the
etnisch, handelwijs, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "et" in "ethnisch" (Dutch for "ethnic") and "hande-" in "handlewijzen" ("to handle or manage something skillfully", literally) start with the /hɛtʰ/ combination of sounds.In this case, I justified my response by carefully examining each word's spelling to identify its starting sequence. Since they share similar initial letters (/het-), we can conclude that indeed, both words begin with the same conson
leugenachtigste, levenswerkelijkheid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "leugenachtigste" begins with /l/, which is also the starting point of "/lvns-" in "levenswerkelijkheid". The justification for this conclusion lies in phonetics: both words start with sounds that come from different parts of the mouth but share similar characteristics due to their linguistic context within English (the language used by most people who interacted with me). This similarity makes them belong to the same category when considering whether or not
planimetreer, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "planimetrie" (meaning "plane metering") and "-radend-" ("-rending", as in tearing or cutting) both start with the /p/ consonant sound.Justification:In linguistics, phonetically similar sounds can refer to different letters of the alphabet that produce identical auditory effects when pronounced correctly by native speakers of a language. In this case, we're dealing with the beginning consonants of each word:1. The first syllable
planimetreer, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "planimètre" (Dutch for "metering plane") and "kerkenderen" (a type of bird) start with the /p/ or /kr/ sounds.Justification: The word "planimètereer" is not a real word in Dutch; I assume you meant to write either one separately. If that's correct:* "Planimeteren", which means "to meter by a measuring device called 'plane'", starts with the letter
warrelig, wijngaardluis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "warrelig" starts with /w/, which is also the beginning of "/wij-" in "wijngaard". Additionally, both start with the letter combination "wr", making them share the same initial consonantal sounds (/w/) or phonemes. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
wegdruip, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "wegdruip" and "-ingestort" both start with the /w/ or /v/ phoneme, which is often referred to as a voiceless labiodental fricative in linguistics. This means that they share the same initial consonantal sound. In fact, the letters 'W' and 'V' represent this exact sound combination in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these Dutch words do indeed
tensie, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "tensie" and "ingestorte" both start with the /t/ consonant sound, which is considered to have the same phonetic value in this context. In linguistics, when comparing sounds between different languages or dialects, we consider factors such as place of articulation (e.g., lips, tongue), manner of production (e.g., voicing, frication), and other acoustic properties that define each distinct sound unit. Since
huurcompensaties, hazeslaapjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "huurcompensaties" and "hazeslaapjes" start with the /h/ sound.Justification: The first letter in each word is indeed "H", which indicates that they share the same initial consonant phoneme (/h/) or sounds alike when pronounced correctly (e.g., [hx] vs. [hz]). This justifies my affirmative response to your question.<|eot_id|>
wegdruip, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "wegdruk" ( Weg-dru-k) and "bedrijf" (Bed-ry-f) both start with /w/. In phonetics, this is known as the voiceless labiovelar fricative or w-sound (/ʷ). The initial consonants of each word share the identical pronunciation and articulation, making them homophonous for speakers who know Dutch. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed begin with the same conson
darmonderzoek, duivelste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "darmonderzoek" starts with the /d/ consonant, while the second word "duivelste" also begins with the /d/ consonant. Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound, which is the voiced dental stop /d/.<|eot_id|>
delfstof, duivelste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "delfstof", starts with /d/, which is also the beginning of the second word, "/dui-". The letters 'f' in "delfstof" do not affect the starting consonantal sound because they come after the initial '/d/'. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound /d/.<|eot_id|>
jatten, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "jatten" and "nadoken" (not exactly equal to "nadook", but I assume that's what you meant) start with the /dʒ/ or soft-g sound.Justification: In Dutch phonology, the letter combination "jt-" is pronounced as [d͡ʒ] (a voiced postalveolar affricate), which corresponds to English sounds like in "treasure". The word "jadokken" means to nod off to
weergeving, wolkachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "weergeving" and "wolkachtigste" start with the letter combination "/wr/" which represents the same consonant sound.Justification:In the Dutch language, when two or more letters appear together to form a single phoneme (sound), they are considered as one unit. In this case, the letters "W", "R", and sometimes also "V" can make different sounds depending on their position in a word. However, in general, /WR
woudduivel, waterchinees, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "w" in both words starts as a /ʋ/ (vocalic labiodental fricative) or sometimes pronounced like English "f", which represents the same consonant sound, specifically the voiceless bilabial approximant [ʍ]. This phonetic similarity allows us to conclude that they share the same starting consonantal feature.<|eot_id|>
meesmuilend, mentrix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "meesmuilend" starts with the /m/ sound, which is represented by the letter combination "ms". The second word "mentorix" also begins with the /m/ sound, making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
beschietend, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "beschieten" starts with /b/, which is also the beginning of the second word "/esthetic". Both words share the initial consonantal phoneme /b/. Justification: The sounds in question (/p/) or (/t/) would not match as both words start with different letters ('B' vs 'E'). It's crucial to focus on the actual pronunciation when examining similar cases like this one. In contrast, we have identical starting points for
leugenachtigste, lessende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "leugen" starts with the /l/ consonant sound, while the second word "lessende" also begins with the /l/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same starting consonant sound, which is /l/.<|eot_id|>
rijpaard, ruilhandel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "rijpaard" and "ruilhandel" start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as:* "rijpaard": [ʁɪjˈpärt] (the /r/ is pronounced like a guttural trill)* "ruilhandel": [rylˈɦandəl] (again, starting with
schreeuwerigere, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "schreeuw" starts with /s/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "indeks". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound /s/. However, please note that there might not exist such compound nouns in real-life language usage as you provided them (e.g., "schreeuwerige-in-de-ux"). I'm assuming this was just for demonstration purposes or perhaps from another linguistic context where those exact
busbanen, bontstola's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "busbanen", starts with the /b/ consonant sound (the voiced bilabial stop). The second word, "bontstola'", also begins with this exact same consonant sound (/b/) followed by different vowels and sounds. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant phoneme or sound in their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
omsingel, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "omsingel" and "esthetic" start with the /s/ or "sh" sounds, which are considered as similar in phonetics and linguistics. The word "omzingelen" (Dutch) indeed starts with the /zɛŋəl/ pronunciation while English "estimate" begins with /ˈɛstɪtɪk/, but for simplicity's sake we can consider them to share the initial /s
wegdruip, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "wegdruip" and "ontroomt" both start with the /w/ or /v/ sounds, which is equivalent to the English letter combination "w". This justifies my initial response as yes because they share the same starting consonantal phoneme in their respective pronunciations. In standard Dutch pronunciation, the letters 'w' typically represent this voiced labiovelar approximant [ʋ] (similarly pronounced like the Germanic
sinus, serredeur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "sinus" starts with /s/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "serredeur". Both words start with the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by different vowels, making them share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
parkachtige, petekinderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "parkachtige" starts with the /p/ consonant sound, which is also present in the second word "petekinderen". Both words start with the voiced bilabial plosive phoneme /p/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
mastkoker, melkpoeier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "mast" in "mastkoker" and "melk" in "melkpoeier" start with the /m/ sound.Justification: In phonetics, the letter combination "st" is typically pronounced as /s/, not /t/. Therefore, when we look at the beginning of each word:* "Mast-" starts with the voiced labiodental nasal fricative /m/.* "-Ko-k-er" has no effect on
kruisbessestruik, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "k" in "Kruisbessetruik" and "v" in "Invul" start with a /k/ or /kv/ (a voiceless velar plosive) consonantal phoneme, which can also be transcribed as [k] by some linguists when dealing with English pronunciation. Although not identical sounds (/kʰ/ vs. /f/, for instance), they share similar characteristics within their respective languages
huilerigheid, heesterachtig, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "huilerigheid" begins with /h/, while the second word "heesterachtig" also starts with /h/. Therefore, they both share the same initial consonant sound of /h/.<|eot_id|>
lieveling, lendeberoerte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "lieveling" starts with /l/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "L endeerboorte". Both words have the letter combination "/l/" at their beginning, indicating that they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
windbuksen, wolkachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wind" in "windbuksen" and "wolkach-" in "wolkachtigste" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative consonant sound.Justification: The letters "W" represent this specific phoneme (/v/) when they appear at the beginning of a word in many languages including English and Dutch. This is why we can conclude that both words share the initial /v/ (or voiceless labiodental fr
piepjongst, bijstanders, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "piepjongs" and "-bijstanders" both start with the /p/ or /bj/ (which is often pronounced as /bj/) sounds, which are similar in that they share the same place of articulation (/bilabial) but differ slightly in their manner and voicing. This similarity justifies my affirmative response despite some minor differences between them.<|eot_id|>
reproducenten, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "reproducenten", begins with the /r/ sound (the letter combination "rep" is pronounced as a trill), while the second word, "statica", also starts with the /s/ or /st/ sound (depending on how one pronounces Latin-derived loanwords). Although they don't start exactly alike in terms of phonetics (/r/ vs./s/, respectively), both sounds can roughly approximate to being similar enough for our purposes -
wijwatervat, wolfskuil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "wij" begins with /w/, which is also the initial consonantal phoneme of the second word "wolf". The remaining parts, "s", "k", "u", "i", and "l" do not affect this similarity in sounds at the beginning.<|eot_id|>
toerekent, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "toerekent" and "voorig" (not "vorilig", I assume that's a typo) start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative phoneme.Justification:In the first word, "toreekent", we have the letter combination "/tr/" which is often pronounced as [vr] in Dutch, resulting in the starting vowel-less consonantal cluster /vr/. In the second word, "voorig", there is no
buffers, buitenbanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "buffers" starts with the /b/ sound (a voiced bilabial plosive), which is also present at the beginning of the second word "buitenbanden". Although there's no exact match in English pronunciation for this combination, the initial sounds share the same phonetic characteristics (/p/, /t/, or /d/) as the voiceless labiodental fricative /f/. In linguistic terms, both start with what
tensie, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "tensie" starts with /t/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "duivelsklauwen". The justification for this response lies in the phonetic analysis: both words share the initial voiceless alveolar stop [t]. This similarity can help identify that they start with the identical consonant sound, specifically "/t/" in this case.<|eot_id|>
dassenhanger, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "dassenhanger" and "donkerden" start with the letter "D", which is pronounced as /d/. This means they share the same initial consonantal phoneme.Justification:* The word "dassenhanger" begins with the letters "das-", where "s" is silent in this context.* Similarly, the word "donkerden" starts with the letters "don-".* In both cases, the first letter is indeed "D
Jut, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "jut" and "invullen" both start with the /v/ or /f/ phoneme, which is pronounced similarly to English's 'v' or 'f'. In Dutch orthography, this sound can sometimes appear as either "v", "f", "w", or even no letter at all (e.g., in loanwords). However, for native speakers of Germanic languages like English, the closest approximation would likely involve pronouncing them alike
kielvlak, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kielvlak" and "-vorlichtte" start with the /k/ or /kl/ (depending on how you pronounce them) consonantal sound.Justification:The word "kielvlak" starts with the letters "K-I-E-L", which together form the distinct phonetic sequence of sounds represented by "/kiːl/vlak". Meanwhile, the suffix "-vorlichtte" begins with the letter combination "V-O-R-", where the first
invallen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "invullen" begins with the /v/ sound, while the word "esthetica" starts with the /s/ sound (or /z/ in some accents). However, when we consider that both sounds can be represented by the letter combination'st' or'str', they share similar phonetic characteristics at their onset. In this case, I'm considering not only individual letters but also how those letters combine to form distinct auditory patterns. Therefore,
havengebouw, hongerlappen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "haven" in "havengbouw" and "hongeren" in "hongerlappen" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed 'H', which indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme or speech sound. This similarity can help identify patterns and relationships between words when learning languages like Dutch!<|eot_id|>
koelkamer, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "koelkamer" starts with the /k/ sound, which is represented by the letter combination "Ko". The second word "wegdruip" also begins with this exact same consonantal phoneme "/k/" as well. Therefore, my justification for saying yes to your question lies in their shared initial consonance or starting sounds being identical (/k/) despite having different meanings and grammatical functions within sentences.<|eot_id|>
duif, reproducenten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "duif" starts with /d/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the second word "reprodusenten". The letter combination "-r-" in "reproducernten" does not affect this, as the actual pronunciation would still start with a voiceless dental stop /t/. Therefore, both words share the initial consonant sound /d/.<|eot_id|>
joysticks, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "joysticks", starts with /j/, which is pronounced as a voiced postalveolar affricate [dʒ]. The second word, "duivelsklauwen", begins with /d/, which represents a voiceless alveolar stop [t] in IPA transcription (since 'u' doesn't affect the start of the word). Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("j" vs. "d"), both
binnenvaartuigen, busbanen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "binnenvaartuigen" and "busbanen" start with the /b/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "binnenvaartuigen" begins with the letter combination "bn", which is pronounced as /bɛn/. This represents the voiceless bilabial stop phoneme (/p/) followed by the nasalized vowel sound.* Similarly, the word "busbanen" starts with the letters "bs".
etnisch, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "etnisch" and "duivelsklauwen" start with the /d/ or voiced dental stop consonantal sound.Justification: The word "etnisch" begins with the letter combination "dt", which is pronounced as a single phoneme /d/. Similarly, in the compound noun "duivelsklauwen", the letters "dv" also represent this exact sound /d/, since they form a cluster that's typically palatalized to [
maatregel, marktdagen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "maatregel" starts with the /m/ sound (a voiced bilabial nasal), which is also present in the second word "marktdagen". Both words start with this identical consonantal phoneme, making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
planimetreer, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "planimeteren" starts with the /p/ sound (the letter combination 'pl' is often pronounced as /p/) in Standard European Dutch pronunciation. Similarly, the second word "bedrijf" also begins with the /b/ sound. Although both sounds (/p/ and /b/) are different phonetically, linguistically speaking, they can still be considered starting with the same consonantal place of articulation or manner of speech
kokkie, kemelsgaren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kokkie" begins with /k/, while the word "kemelsgaren" also starts with /k/. The justification is that both words share the initial consonant phoneme "/k/", which indicates they start with the same consonantal sound in this case, specifically the voiceless velar plosive [k].<|eot_id|>
korzeliger, koepelovens, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "korzeliger" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "koepelovens". Therefore, both words share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/k/) or starting sound.<|eot_id|>
landbouwarbeidswetten, laagvormigst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "landbouwwarbeids" starts with the /l/ sound (a voiced alveolar lateral approximant), which is also present at the beginning of each subsequent word ("-laag", "-wet-", etc.). Therefore, all these Dutch words start with the same consonant sound, specifically /l/.<|eot_id|>
schreeuwerigere, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "schreeuw" starts with /s/, which is also the beginning of the second word "/static". Both start with the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
etnisch, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "et" in "ethnisch" (meaning ethnic) and "zett-" in "-zetterijen" (a suffix forming nouns related to setting or making something) start with the /tʃ/ sound.Justification: In the first word, "ethnisch", we have the digraph combination "et". The letter 'e' is silent before another vowel-less consonant like 'h', which leaves us with only one distinct sound - /t
huidworm, hockeyclubs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "huid" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present in the word "hockey". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/h/) making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
turkten, tinteloogt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "turkten" begins with the /tr/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "tinteloogt". Both words start with the trill-consonantal combination /tr/. This justifies my affirmative response to your question!<|eot_id|>
ontruimt, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ontruimt" and "invullen" start with the /n/ or nasal stop consonant.Justification:* The word "ontruimt" starts with the letter combination "o-n", which is pronounced as /ɔn/, but in this case, we can simplify to just "/n/" since the preceding vowel does not affect its pronunciation.* Similarly, the word "invullen" also begins with the letters "i-v-", which is again
regelingen, radiostraling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "regelingen" starts with the /r/ consonant sound (the voiced alveolar trill), while the second word "radio-straling" also begins with this same consonant sound (/r/). Justification:In both cases, we can identify that the initial letters 'R' in each of the words represent the voiceless alveolar fricative or sometimes referred to as a retroflexion. This is because in phon
onderligger, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "onder" in "onderligger" starts with /nd/, which is a combination of two sounds, while "Jut" begins with the voiceless postalveolar fricative /tʃ/. These two initial segments have different phonetic properties (stops vs. fricatives) but share no identical quality or manner of articulation to form the same consonant sound. Therefore, they do not start with the same consonant sound. However,
weergeving, waterbuffel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "weergeving", starts with the /w/ sound (the letter combination "we" is pronounced as a voiced labiovelar approximant), while the second word, "waterbuffel", also begins with this exact same consonantal phoneme (/w/) in its prefix ("wa"). Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
kousenkoper, kibbelzieker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kousenkoper" and "kibbelziezer" start with the letter combination "/ks/" which is pronounced as a single consonantal unit in many languages including English.Justification: In phonetics, /s/ followed by another voiceless alveolar stop (like 'p', 't' or 'k') forms a cluster called tenuis affricate [ts] that represents one distinct segment of speech. This phenomenon occurs frequently across various language families
kamerlid, kousenkoper, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kamerlid" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, which is also present at the start of the second word "kousenkoper". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics: both words share the initial voiceless velar plosive (/k/) as their first consonantal segment, making them identical from that perspective.<|eot_id|>
werklunch, waag, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "werklunch" and "waag" start with the /w/ or 'double-u' consonant sound.Justification: The initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as [wɛr-] for "werklunch", which represents the voiced labiovelar approximant followed by the schwa vowel; and as ['ʷaːx] for "waag", representing the voiceless labial-palatal fricative
kielvlakken, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "kielvlakken", starts with the letter combination "/k/" which represents the voiceless velar plosive /kʰ/. Similarly, the second word, "sciopticons" (which I assume is not a real English or Germanic word but rather a made-up term), also begins with the letters "sk-" that would typically represent the voiced postalveolar fricative /z/ followed by the voiceless al
dijkheemraadschappen, doodgeergerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "dijkheemraadschappen" starts with the /dj- sounds (the combination of 'd' and 'j'), which represents the voiceless alveolar stop followed by the voiced postalveolar approximant in English phonetics transcription system.Similarly, the second word " doodgeërgerde" also begins with the "/dg-" or "" sounds, where '/g/' is pronounced as a soft palate lift before voicing like
handelwijs, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "handel" and "-legt" in "handelwijs-vorleegt" start with /h/, which is the same consonant sound.Justification: The first word "handel" begins with the letter combination "hd", where "d" comes after "h". Similarly, the suffix "-legt" starts with the letters "lgt", but since there's no other vowel between them, we can ignore the intervening letters for phonetic purposes.
toerekent, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "toerekent" and "voorgelgt" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative consonantal sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as:* Toerekent: /tʊrəˈkɛnt/	+ The first letter is 'T', which represents a voiceless alveolar plosive (/t/) followed by other letters.* Voor
wegdruip, deeltijdbanen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wegdruip" and "deeltijdbanen" start with the /w/ or /dw/ (in some cases) sounds.Justification:* The word "wegdruip" starts with the letter combination "wd", which is pronounced as /wɛgˈdrʊyp/, where the initial /w/ represents a voiceless labiovelar approximant.* Similarly, the phrase "deeltijdbanen"
koffietafelde, kamferballetje, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "koffie", starts with the /k/ sound (a voiceless velar stop), while the second word, "kamfer" also begins with the /k/ sound. Additionally, both words have the suffix "-taf-" which is attached to them in their respective forms ("koftjetafelde" being a plural form of something related to coffee table) and "kamfersballetjes". This similarity suggests that they
welpenleidster, waag, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "w" sounds in "welpenleidster" (which starts as "we") and "waag" start with /v/, which is often represented by the letter combination "wh". However, when pronounced correctly, the initial sound of each word begins with the voiceless labiodental fricative [f] or its equivalent approximation for non-native speakers (/ʋ). This means they share the same phonetic beginning despite being written differently due
doodrijdend, domkapittel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "dood" begins with /d/, which is also the starting point of the second word's root "rijk-" (in "rijkdom"). Although there might seem to be some extra letters in between, both roots start with the same phoneme (/d/) or more specifically, stop voice alveolar plosive [d]. The rest of each word can differ significantly without affecting this shared initial feature.<|eot_id|>
vuurwerkers, vuistregel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "vuurwerkers" starts with the /v/ sound (voiced labiodental fricative), which is also present in the second word "vuistregel". The initial sounds of both words share the identical phoneme (/v/) making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
foutslag, finisht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "fout" starts with the /f/ sound, which is also present in the second word "finist", specifically at its beginning as "/fn-". Although there's no direct match between "s" (in slags) or any other letters that come after "ft" (the combination of sounds), I'm considering only the initial consonantal phonemes for this comparison. Therefore, both "fout" and "finish't' start with the
gemeste, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "gemeste" and "aanvijl" both start with the letter combination /g/. In phonetics, this is considered to have the same initial consonantal sound as other combinations that include the letters /k/, /kh/, or /x', which all represent voiceless velar stops (ejective or aspirated). Therefore, I conclude that they share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
penhamers, permit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "penhamers" starts with the /p/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "permit". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/p/) in their spelling.<|eot_id|>
piepjongst, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "piepjongst" and "bagatelen" start with different sounds, but they both have /b/ as their first letter in written form (Dutch uses b for beta or bee-like sounds). The justification is that while we focus on phonetics when talking about similar-sounding letters, here I considered only the presence of 'B' at the beginning which makes them share this characteristic. However, please note that actual pronunciation might differ due to regional accents or
attentie, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "attentie" begins with /aʈ/, which is pronounced as "ah-truh". The second word "indoken" also starts with /d/. Although they don't have exactly the same letter, their sounds share similarities in being voiced stops (the tongue blocks airflow briefly while pronouncing them). In phonetics, this similarity can be justified by considering that both /t/ and /d/ belong to the stop category of consonants. This means that
tensie, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "tensie" starts with the /tʃ/ (ch) sound, which is represented by the letters "ts". The second word "kielvlak" also begins with this exact combination of sounds (/k/, followed by the letter "i", resulting in a soft-ch or ts-like pronunciation). Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound: /tʃ/.<|eot_id|>
kwintalen, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "kwintalen" and "wegdruip" both start with the /k/ or /kv/ combination, which is considered to have similar sounds in phonetics. In fact, they share the exact same initial letter "K". This similarity can lead us to conclude that their starting consonants do indeed match.<|eot_id|>
Jut, smadelijkst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "Jut" and "smadelijkst" both start with the /xʃ/ or /ks/ phoneme, which is pronounced similarly to the English word "church". In standard Dutch orthography, this combination of letters (the digraphs "ch", "tsj", etc.) represents a single voiceless postalveolar fricative affricate [t͡ɕ] or velar plosive-approx
mastkoker, morzelen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "mastkoker" starts with /m/, which is also the beginning of the second word "morzelen". Both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonant phoneme /m/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
wijwatervat, wolfsangels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "wij" starts with the /w/ sound (a voiceless labiovelar fricative), which is also present in the second word "wolf". Although there might seem to be some difference due to vowel sounds between them ("ij" vs. no vowels for wolf's starting letters), both start with this distinct consonantal phoneme (/w/) making their initial parts share similar characteristics. This similarity holds true even when considering diac
kappersaus, korenzolders, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "kappers" starts with /k/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the second word "koren". Although they have different vowels, their initial sounds share the same voiceless velar stop consonant (/k/) in both cases. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two Dutch words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
detacheer, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "detacheer" and "-ordende" start with the /d/ or dental stop consonantal sound, which is represented by the letter combination 'dt' in the word "detacheer". In phonetics, this sounds like [t] followed closely after another (a phenomenon known as coarticulation). The prefix '-orde-' also starts with the voiced alveolar fricative consonantal sound [ð], but since English doesn't have a
nachtcremes, nanoseconde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "nacht" starts with the /kʃ/ (ksch) sound in Dutch, while the second word "nanoseconde" has no direct equivalent in English but can be broken down to its individual sounds as "na-no-se-kɔnd". In this case, both start with the /n/ sound, which is what I considered when answering your question. Note that language pronunciation may vary depending on regional accents or dialect
wedergaf, waterski's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "wedergaf" starts with /w/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "waterski". Therefore, both words share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/w/) despite having different meanings in English ("gave back again" vs. type of water sport). In this case, we can consider them to start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
jut, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "jut" and "interimaat" both start with the /xʊt/ or /d͡zʊt/ sounds, which can be represented as a single phoneme (/xt/) in this case. The first word is pronounced like 'hoot' without the vowel at the end (just a brief pause), while the second one has more of a guturalized quality to its initial syllable ('kh-ter-i-ma-at').
narratiefste, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "narratiefste", starts with the letter combination /nr/, which represents the voiceless alveolar nasal stop followed by the labiovelar approximant (a unique sound in many languages).The second word, "voorgelegd", also begins with the letters "/vr/", representing the voiced velar fricative followed by the liquid lateral approximant.Although they have different vowel sounds following their initial consonants (/r/ vs./
detacheer, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "detacheer" starts with /d/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "vooreinde". In fact, both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop /tʃ/. Therefore, my answer to this question is affirmative - yes!<|eot_id|>
lacto-vegetarier, levensverschijnselen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that all three words start with the "l" or /ɫ/ (labial approximant) sound, which is considered to have the same consonantal quality in phonetics. The prefix "-lac-" in "lactovegetariër", the word itself "levensverschijnse-len", and finally the suffixes "-en" attached to both of them share this identical initial consonance (/l/) making their starts similar. In linguistics terms
samengesmolten, sydniers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "samengesmolten" starts with the letter combination /s/, which represents the voiceless alveolar fricative [s] or schwa-less's' in English phonetics, whereas the second word "synders" begins with the letters /s/. Both start with the exact same consonantal sound of /s/. Therefore, they share the identical beginning consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
warrelig, waag, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "war" in "warfelig" (which means 'wary' or 'cautious') and "wa-" in "waag" ('scale', as in weighing scale) start with the /vɑr-ʋɑːg/ combination, which represents the same consonantal beginning sound (/vr/) followed by different vowels ("arfelig") respectively). This similarity indicates they share similar initial sounds despite having distinct meanings.<|eot_id|>
tensie, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "tensie" and "omsingel" start with the /ts/ or /sʈ/ consonant sound.Justification:* In Dutch phonology, the letter combination "ts" is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar affricate [ts] (similar to the English word "bits").* Both "tensie" and "omsingel" have this initial sequence of letters: t-s.* Since they share the identical starting point
antwoordend, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "antwoordend" and "voorgelgt" both start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative, which is considered as one of the most common sounds in many languages including English. In this case, we can see that they share similar starting letters 'V' (which represents the voiceless bilabial plosive) followed by different vowels. This indicates that their beginning consonants have identical phonetic properties despite
zenuwpijn, avondfeesten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "zenuwpijn" starts with /zn/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, while the second word "avondfeesten" starts with /v/. Although they may look similar when written down, their initial sounds differ in terms of place of articulation (/z/ vs. /v/) and voicing (both voiced). Therefore, despite being represented by different letters ("Z" and "V"), I conclude that they do
voorlig, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "voor" and "esth-" start with /v/. In phonetics, "/v/" represents a voiced labiodental fricative, which is pronounced as in English "very". Therefore, despite having different letters ("f" vs. no letter), they share the same consonantal sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
profilerend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "profileren" starts with the /p/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "aanvlijn". Both words start with the voiceless bilabial plosive consonantal sound (/p/) followed by different vowels and suffixes. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
voorlig, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "voor" begins with the /v/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "vers". The third word "voet-" starts with the same /v/ sound as well. Therefore, all three words start with the same consonant sound /v/.<|eot_id|>
losgespende, lekzucht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "los" (free) and "lekzen" (to lick) both start with the /l/ consonant sound, which is the correct justification for my affirmative response. The remaining letters in each word differ from one another, but they share this common initial phoneme (/l/) that begins their respective sounds. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these Dutch words do indeed commence with the identical consonant sound of /l/.<|eot_id|>
wildspiegels, wegschrijft, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "wildspiegel" starts with /w/, which is also the first letter of the second word "wegschrijft", starting at "/wg/. Both start with the voiced labiovelar approximant [ʷ] or the voiceless alveolar fricative /vɡ/, so they share the same initial consonantal sounds, specifically the combination /vwg/.<|eot_id|>
framepjes, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "framepjes" starts with /f/, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "nadooks". The justification for this conclusion comes from comparing the initial sounds or phonemes (/) within each word:- In "framepjes", we have /fr/- Similarly, in "nadooks", there's again /n/Both start with either a voiceless labiodental fricative (the letter 'F') followed by another
regelingen, roepzalen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "regelingen" starts with the /r/ consonant sound (the trilled R in Dutch), while the word "roepzalen" also begins with this exact same sound (/r/). Therefore, my justification is that both words start with the identical consonantal phoneme of /r/.<|eot_id|>
legkast, levensdrift, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "legkast" and "leven-drift" start with the /l/ consonant sound.Justification: The first word is "legkast", which begins with the letter combination "L-E-G-K-A-S-T". All of these letters except for 'E' make sounds that follow after the initial vowel in English (the silent E). However, when pronounced as one unit by native speakers or according to phonetic transcription rules ("lek-kahst"), we
lekhoning, leemaarde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "lekhoning" starts with /l/, which is also the beginning of the second word "leemaarde". Both words have the letter combination "leh-" at their start, making them share the same consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
jatte, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "jatte" begins with /ʤ/, which is pronounced like the English letter combination "dj". Similarly, the word "invul" also starts with /v/. Although they may seem different at first glance, both sounds can be represented by the Romanization of the letters J (or dj) as /d͡ʒ/ or V respectively. This means that in phonetic terms, both start with similar consonantal sounds (/d͡�
plantluis, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "plant" and "tchis-" start with /pl-/. Although they have different letters, their sounds match: /p/ followed by /l/, which represents the phoneme /pl/. The rest of each word's beginning (the vowel or other subsequent consonants) doesn't affect this initial consonantal similarity assessment for Dutch languages.<|eot_id|>
jut, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "jut" (meaning'short' or'stunted') and "voorraad" ('stockpile', but in this case, probably referring to "voorlichting", meaning 'preparation' or 'getting ready for something'), both start with the /vʋ/ phoneme which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative [v] followed by a slight approximation of the lips towards each other (/uː/)
piepjongst, koelkamer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "piepjong" starts with the /p/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "koel-kamer". Although there's a hyphen (-) between them in your original question, I'm considering each part separately to evaluate if they start with the same consonantal phoneme (sound). In this case, both parts share the initial /p/ or /kʰ/ sound respectively, hence my affirmative response
Jut, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "Jut" starts with the /dʒ/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiced postalveolar affricate (like in "judge"). The second word "Kerkerende" also begins with the /k/ sound, which represents a voiceless velar plosive. Although they have different letters (/t/, /c/) at their beginning, both sounds can be transcribed to [k] or [kh], indicating that
thermisch, tinteloogt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "thermisch" and "tinteloogt" start with the /t/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter in each word is indeed "T", which represents the voiceless alveolar stop phoneme (/t/) in Standard Dutch pronunciation. This means that they share the initial consonantal segment of their sounds, making them homophonous for speakers who pronounce them correctly.<|eot_id|>
ritshouten, reddinggordel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "ritschouten" and "reddings gordel" start with /r/, which represents the same consonant sound in phonetics. In linguistics, this type of correspondence between sounds from different languages or dialects is called cognate initials (or initial correspondences). This means they share similar articulatory features, such as place, manner, voicing, etc., making them equivalent for purposes like language learning, translation, or even speech recognition systems.
noodschool, naklanken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "noodschool" starts with /nd/, which is a combination of two sounds, nasal 'n' followed by alveolar 'd'. Similarly, the second word "naklanken" also begins with /nk/. Although they may seem different at first glance, both combinations start with a similar stop-consonantal cluster (/nd/) or (//) respectively), making them share the same initial consonant sound. Therefore, I conclude that yes,
hoevende, hangoortafels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "hoevende" and "hangoortafels" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "hoevende" begins with the letter combination "ho", which is pronounced as /h/.* Similarly, the compound noun "hangoortafels" starts with the letters "han-", also pronounced as /h/.Since both words share the initial /h/ consonant sound, my response to your question is affirmative: yes
huidworm, hazeslaapjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "huid" starts with /h/, which is also present in both "hazelsleeps". The similarity lies not only between individual letters but sounds, as well. In phonetics, this phenomenon can occur when two or more distinct languages share similar linguistic features due to historical influences like language contact, borrowing, or convergence.<|eot_id|>
sciopticons, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "sciopticon" and "vuilpersleiding" start with the /s/ or /sk/ sounds.Justification:* The word "sciopticon" begins with the letter combination "sci", which is pronounced as /skiˈɛp.ti.kon/, where the initial /s/ has a voiceless alveolar fricative quality.* Similarly, the first part of the compound noun "vuilpers-leiding"
meridionaal, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "meridionale" (meaning "lumbar") and "zenuwpijn" (meaning "nerve pain") both start with the /m/ or "em" consonant sound, which is the correct justification for my yes response. The first word starts with "me", while the second one begins with "zu". However, in phonetics, both sounds can be transcribed as /m/, indicating that they share the same starting consonantal quality
landbouwarbeidswetten, ladingskromme, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "landbouwarbeidswetten" and "ladingskromme" start with the /l/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "landbouwarbeidswetten" begins with the letters L-A-N-D-B-O-U-W-A-R-B-E-I-D-S-W-E-T-T-E-N.	+ Since there is no other letter before or after 'L' that would change its pronunciation to another consonantal sound (like M, R,
duif, indoken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "duif" starts with /d/, which is also present in the second word "indoken". They both have the initial consonant phoneme /d/.<|eot_id|>
lijmerigste, losgespende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "lijmerigste" and "losgespende" both start with the /l/ consonant sound, which is what I mean by them beginning with the same consonant sound in this case.<|eot_id|>
wandelpassen, weergeving, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "wandelpassen" starts with /w/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word, "weergeven". Both words have the initial phoneme /w/.<|eot_id|>
disconterend, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "dis" in "disconterend" and "dui-" in "duif" start with the /dʒ/ or /dsch/ (depending on pronunciation) consonant sound, which is often represented by the letter combination "dj", "dtj", or simply "d". This means they share the same initial consonantal phoneme. In linguistics, this phenomenon is called homorganic initials.<|eot_id|>
vinkers, vakwerkconstructies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "vinkers" starts with /f/, which is pronounced as a voiceless labiodental fricative, while the second phrase "vakwerkconstructies" also begins with /v/. Although they look similar in writing (the letter combination 'vk' can sometimes appear to start with the voiced velar plosive /k/) both sounds represent distinct phonemes (/f/ vs. /v/) that have different places of articulation within the mouth
treknet, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "treknet" starts with the /tr/ consonant sound, which is also present in the second word "voorraad". Both words have the initial sounds of /tɾ/.<|eot_id|>
planimetreer, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "planimètre" (Dutch for "plane meter") and "gemeste" start with the /p/ consonant sound.Justification: In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows:* "planimètere": /plaˈnimeʔtərɛ/	+ The first letter is 'P', which represents the voiceless bilabial plosive (/p/) sound.* "gem
voorlieg, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "voor" in "voorlieg-" and "on"- in "-ont dek ken" start with the /v/ or /n/ sounds.Justification: The first word starts with "vor", which is pronounced as /foːr/, where "f" represents the voiceless labiodental fricative (the sound of English "fish"). In contrast, the second word begins with "ond-", which can also represent either /ɔnt/ (
attentie, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "attentie" begins with /aʈ/, which is pronounced as a combination of the sounds /at/. The second set of letters in parentheses represents the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription for each word's initial consonantal sequence.* "lawinegevaar", on its part, starts off by having the letter combinations "/l/", then followed by other phonemes that aren't crucial here since we're solely focusing on whether both start with
lispen, laagvormigst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "lispen" starts with the letter combination "/lɪs-/", which begins with the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/. Similarly, the second word "laagvormigst" also starts with the letters "/l-", followed by other sounds "-a-" and then "-g-". Although there might seem to be differences in pronunciation between them due to their meanings being unrelated (one means 'to listen'
leugenachtigste, liefkozend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "leugen" and "liefkozende" start with the letter combination /lj/. In Dutch phonology, this is considered to represent a single consonantal unit, often transcribed as [ʟ] or [ɫ]. This means that they share the same initial consonant sound.Justification:* The letters 'L' in each word do not have their usual English pronunciation of voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (/l/) because the following vowel
lijmerigste, leraarden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "lijmerigste" and "leraren" start with the letter combination /l/. In phonetics, this is known as a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant followed by a voiced dental fricative in IPA notation: [ʟ] + [r]. This constitutes the same consonantal cluster or onset for each word, which means they share the starting sounds of their names.<|eot_id|>
lijmerigste, lendeberoerte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "lijmerigste" starts with the letter combination "lj", which represents the /lʲ/ or soft L sound in Dutch. Similarly, the second word "lendeberoerte" also begins with the letters "ld". Although the spelling is different, both start with the same phonetic value of the /L/ (or l) sound, making them share the same consonantal beginning.<|eot_id|>
tanig, toestekende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "tanig" starts with /t/, which is also the starting letter of "/to-" in "toestekende". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics, specifically in identifying similar sounds or combinations that appear at the beginning of each word. In both cases, we have the voiceless alveolar stop /t/. This similarity indicates that they share the same initial consonantal feature. Therefore, I conclude that the two words do indeed start with the
zuivelboeren, zaadlobben, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zuivelboeren" and "zaadlobben" start with the /z/ consonant sound.Justification:* The first word, "zuivelboeren", starts with the letter combination "zu-", which is pronounced as /zuːɪvəlboʊrən/. Here, we can see that the initial phoneme (sound) is indeed /z/.* Similarly, in the second word, "zaadlobben",
doelvlak, doorspoelend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "doelvlak" and "doorspoelend" start with the /d/ consonant sound.Justification: The word "doelvlak" begins with the letter combination "do", which is pronounced as /duː/, whereas the prefix in "doorspoelend" also starts with the letters "door". In standard Dutch pronunciation rules, when two vowels or diphthongs come together before a single vowel (as seen here), they form a
haverpluim, hachelden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "haverpluim", starts with the letter combination "hv" which is pronounced as /ɦv/. Similarly, the second word, "hachelden", also begins with the letters "hc". Although they appear to have different initial sounds in written form ("h-v" vs. "h-c"), both start with voiceless labiovelar fricative [χ] or /ħ/, making them share similar consonantal beginnings
huilerigheid, hartinfarct, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "huilerigheid" and "hartinfarct" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification: In linguistics, phonetically similar sounds that can occur in different languages or dialects are often referred to as allophones of a single phone (or distinct unit) called a phoneme. The letter combination "/h/" is one such example where multiple letters may represent this specific sound. Since both words contain the sequence "h", they share the starting point
kamerlid, kampongs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kamerlid" and "kampongs" start with the /k/ sound.Justification: The word "kamerlid" is a noun in Dutch that means "member of parliament", while "Kampungs" (with capital K) refers to rural areas or villages. Both words have the initial letter "K", which represents the voiceless velar plosive (/k/) phoneme in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). This indicates that they share the
binnenstroomden, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "binnenstroomden" begins with the letter combination "/bn/", which represents the /p/ or /f/ phoneme, depending on the context in which they appear together (in this case, both sounds would be acceptable pronunciations). The second word "Joystick" starts with the letters "/j/" representing the voiceless palatal approximant [ʃ] or sometimes also transcribed as /d͡ʒ/. Despite their different spell
regelingen, roep, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "regelingen" and "roep" do indeed start with the same consonant sound /r/. Justification:* In both cases, we have the letter combination "-re-" which is pronounced as /rɛp/.* The letters following this sequence also contribute to maintaining the identical initial consonantal phoneme in each word.* Phonetically speaking, there's no distinction between the starting sounds of "regelingen" (a noun) and
gierehalzen, gastarbeider, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "gierehalzen" and "gastarbeider" start with the /ɡ/ (hard g) sound.Justification:* The word "gierehalzen" starts with the letter combination "G", which is pronounced as a hard /ɡ/ in Standard Netherlands Netherlandic.* Similarly, the word "gastarbeider" also begins with the letters "GA", where again, the pronunciation of "A" before another vowel
tensie, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "tensie" and "indeuk" start with the /tnsɪ-ʔ/ (or more accurately, [ˈtænsi] and [ɛn'deux]) sounds which contain the combination of voiceless alveolar stop (/t/) followed by nasal vowel (/ə/) or glide-like pronunciation in some accents). The initial part "/ten-" matches for both words."<|eot_id|>
tanig, toebreng, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "tanig" begins with the /t/ consonant sound, while the word "toebreng" also starts with the /t/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant phoneme (/t/) in both words.<|eot_id|>
wachtwoord, weergeving, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wachtwoord" and "weergeving" start with the letter combination /hw/. In phonetics, this is known as a voiceless labiovelar fricative or [hʷ]. This means that they share the same initial consonantal sound.Justification:* The word "wachtwoord" starts with the letters W-A-C-H-T-W-O-R-D.	+ The first two letters 'W' represent the voiced bilabial approxim
kiezelbank, conisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "kiezel" in "kiezelschotel" (a type of stone wall) starts with /k/, while "conisch" comes from German, where "-sch" represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ], which sounds similar to English's'sh' or's'. However, for simplicity purposes, we can consider them as starting with the same consonantal cluster "/ks/" since they share the initial letter combination.
kousenkoper, koortrans, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kousenkoper" and "koortrans" start with the letter combination /ks/. This is because in many languages including English and Germanic ones like Dutch, when you have two consecutive letters that make different sounds together (like 'c' followed by another vowel), they can combine to form one distinct phoneme or speech sound.In this case, we see /ks/, which represents a voiceless alveolar affricate [ks] as opposed to just individual
trompetboom, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "trompetboom" starts with the /tr/ consonant sound, which is represented by the letter combination 'tr'. Similarly, the second word "voorige" also begins with this exact same consonant sound /tr/. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
smadelijkst, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "smadelijkst" starts with the letter combination /smd/, which begins with the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by two voiced dental nasals (/mɛd/). On the other hand, the second word "taswoning" also starts with the letters "/t", but they represent different phonemes (the voiceless interdental stop /tʰ/ in this case).Although both words start
indeuk, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "indeuk" (meaning "to think") and "taswoning" (a compound word meaning "cottage or small house", composed of "tasje" - little, tiny + "woninkje" - cottage) both start with the /dʒ/ sound, which is often represented by the letter combination "dj". In phonetics, this corresponds to the voiceless postalveolar affricate [t͡ɕ]. This means
dijkheemraadschappen, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "dijkheemraadschappen" starts with /dj/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme (a combination of sounds) in English. Similarly, the second word "donkerden" also begins with /dnk/. Although written differently, both start with similar consonantal sounds (/j/) followed by different vowels or silent letters. In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as homorganic initial consonants, where two consecutive
lipvormige, landbouwarbeidswetten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "lip" starts with the /l/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of each part in the phrase "-landbouw-" (which sounds like /lan-do-bou/) and "-arbeids-", both starting with /a/. Therefore, all three parts share the initial /l/ or /lʰ/ phoneme, making them start with the same consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
tussenklanken, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "tussen" and "handicaps"-part of "-racerace", start with the /tʃ/ (ch) or "tschwa" phoneme, which represents the same consonant sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The word "klank-" does not affect this analysis as it's part of another compound noun. Therefore, we can conclude that the two given Dutch words share the starting point for their sounds.<|eot_id|>
ontroomt, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ontroomt" and "bagatellen" start with the /b/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "ontroomt" starts with the letter combination "on-", which is pronounced as /ɔn-/, but when considering only the first distinct phoneme (distinctive sounds), we can see that the initial sound of this word is indeed /b/.* Similarly, the word "bagatellen" begins with the letters "ba", which
regio's, rechtstoestanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "regio" and "rechtstoe-stand-en" start with the /r/ or /rh- sound, which makes them share the same initial consonant phoneme in their pronunciation. In linguistics, this phenomenon is called homorganic onset (onset refers to the beginning of a syllable). The sounds represented by 'R' and 'CHT-' (/kʰt/) have similar acoustic properties due to being voiced stops followed by fr
plantluis, overlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "plant" and "overleg" both start with the /pl-=/ or /p-l/ sounds.Justification:* The word "plant" starts with the phoneme /plat/, which is pronounced as a voiceless labiodental plosive followed by a voiced alveolar lateral approximant.* Similarly, the word "overleg" also begins with the sequence of sounds /pleɣ/, where /ʔvər�
wedergaf, wegwerken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "wedergaf" starts with /w/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "wegwerken". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, where the initial sounds or segments of two words can either match (in terms of their place, manner, voicelessness, etc.) to determine if they share similar beginning characteristics. In this case, both words start with the labiovelar approximant stop /w/. This similarity suggests
gemeste, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "gemeste" starts with the letter combination /gəm/, which represents the voiced postalveolar affricate [dʒ] (like in "jam"). On the other hand, the second word "nadook" begins with the letters /n-/. Although they don't share exactly the same starting sounds (/dʒ/ vs./n-/), both start with different types of stops or fricatives that can still be considered as
versmaat, vakwerkconstructies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "versmaat" starts with the /v/ consonant sound, which is also present in the second word "vakwerkkonstructies". The difference lies only in their prefixes: "ver-" for "versmaat", and no prefix or just "-k-" for "vacwerk-".Justification:In phonetics, when comparing two words starting from different positions (prefixes), we should focus on the root of each word to identify commonalities
vergokte, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "vergokte" begins with the /v/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "trompet". The letters 'c' in "vergokte" make no difference to the initial sound as they're pronounced softly (as a guttural fricative) rather than strongly like the hard 'k' or 'ch'. Therefore, both words start with the identical vowel-less consonantal phoneme /v/.<|eot_id|>
duivelsklauw, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "duivels" and "klauw" start with /d/, which is the same consonant sound in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation of spoken languages. The word "ontroomt", however, starts with /o/. Therefore, only two out of three words ("duivels" and "klaw") share the initial /d/ consonant sound. I apologize for any confusion caused by my earlier response.<|eot_id|>
jatten, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "jatten" and "-esthetiek" start with the /h/ or /x/ (kh) sounds.Justification:* The word "jatten" starts with the letter combination "ja", which is pronounced as [ˈʝɑtən] in Standard Dutch, where the initial "j" represents a voiced postalveolar fricative (/z/) followed by a schwa vowel ([a]). This sequence can also be transcribed as
zouterijen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "zouterij" and "statica" start with the /z/ or "tsch" sound, which is considered as a single phoneme in many languages including English. The presence of this similar initial consonantal sequence makes them share the same starting point. In linguistics terms, they both exhibit homophonic properties at their beginning sounds.<|eot_id|>
etnisch, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "et" in "ethnisch" (Dutch for 'ethnic') and "inv" in "invul" (Dutch for 'fill' or 'insert') start with the /t/ sound.Justification: In linguistics, when two sounds appear together at the beginning of a word, they can form what is called a digraph. A digraph is a combination of letters that represents one single phoneme, which is a unit of speech sound. The
attentie, gelukzoekster, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "attentie" and "gelukzoekster" do indeed start with the same consonant sound.Justification:* The word "attentie" begins with the letter combination /at/, which represents the voiceless alveolar stop (/t/) followed by the voiced dental fricative (/ɑː/).* Similarly, the word "gelukzoekster" starts with the letters "g", "l", and "u". Although
etnisch, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "etnisch" begins with /ħ/, which is not a common English phoneme but can be approximated as a soft guttural stop or fricative (like in some Arabic dialects).On the other hand, the word "quintollen" starts with /kʷ/. In this case, both sounds share a similar quality: /ħ/ has a somewhat throaty or back-of-the-throat connotation, while /
negerwijk, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "neger" (in "negerwijk") and "tromp-" in "trompetboom" start with the /nɛr-/, which is pronounced similarly to the English word "near". This suggests that both words share similar beginning sounds. The -er suffix attached to "neger" changes its pronunciation slightly but not enough for us to consider them distinct from each other as far as starting letters go. Similarly,
zonnebaan, zaadlobben, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "zonnebaan" begins with /z/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of "zaadlobben". In both cases, the first letter 'Z' represents this distinctive phoneme in Standard Dutch pronunciation. The similarity between their initial sounds suggests that they share some common characteristics as part of the language's linguistic structure.<|eot_id|>
kousenkoper, koepelovens, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kousenkoper" and "koepelovens" start with the /k/ consonant sound.Justification: In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as [kuːsɛnkopeʳ] for "kousenkoper" (where "u:" represents a long vowel) and [kepəlovens] for "koepelovens". Both words have the voiceless velar plos
zondagssluiting, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "zondagsluiting" and "navel" start with the /z/ or "zed" consonant sound.Justification:The first word "ZONDAGSSLUITING" starts with the letter combination of Z-O-N-D-A-G-S-L-U-I-T-I-N-G which all together form the phoneme /zd/. The second word "NAVEL" begins with N but in Dutch pronunciation, 'n' is often pronounced as /ɳ
meridionaal, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "meridionaal" and "hartzwakte" start with the /m/ or /hm/ (in this case) consonantal sounds.Justification: The first word is "meridionaal", which begins with the letter combination "M-E-R". In phonetics, when two letters appear together in close proximity like that ("ME"), they often blend to form one distinct sound, known as digraphs. Here, we can hear them pronounced more closely
losstaan, lekzucht, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "losstaan" starts with the /l/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "lekzucht". The justification for this answer lies in phonetics: both words have identical initial sounds represented by the letter combination 'ls' or more accurately, [lz] (the schwa vowel between them being silent). This similarity justifies my affirmative response to your question.<|eot_id|>
bijgepunte, bolkaf, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "bijgepunte" starts with the letter combination /bj/, which represents the voiceless bilabial stop followed by a voiced postalveolar fricative, whereas the second word "bolkaf" begins with the single-letter "B", representing a voiced labiodental plosive. Although they both contain the letters "BJ/BK", their starting sounds differ due to the distinct phonetic representations of each sequence in English transcription (the actual pronunciation might vary
roepzalen, rondschreeuwend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "roep" begins with /r/, which is also the starting consonant of the phrase "-ron-". The combination forms the new compound word, where both parts start with the identical consonantal phoneme /r/. Justification: I analyzed each part separately to identify their initial sounds. Both were found to have the distinct beginning as /r/, confirming that they share this commonality in terms of letter-to-sound mapping within the language system.<|eot_id|>
koffietafelde, kemelsgaren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "koffietafeld" starts with /k/, which is also the beginning of the second word "kemelsgaren". Both words start with the voiceless velar stop consonantal sound represented by "/k/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
nadook, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "nad" in "nadowk" (I assume you meant to type "nodok") and "bag" in "bagatelen" start with the /ndʒ/ or "nj" sound.Justification:In Dutch phonology, "d" is often pronounced as /ɣ/, which is similar to English's "g", but more guttural. When followed by another vowel ("o"), this combination sounds like /ŋ/. In some cases
handicaprace, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "handicap" (from "handicaps") and "verlichten" start with /h/. Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed 'H', which represents the voiceless glottal fricative [h] in phonetics. This means that they share the initial consonantal sound /h/, making them homophonous for speakers who pronounce this combination correctly. In linguistics, when two or more sounds appear at the beginning of different morph
uitrokend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "uit" in "uitrokend" and "esth-" (not "eth", which is not present) in "-esthetiek" start with /ʌɪt/, which represents the same consonant sound.Justification: The initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows:* "uitrokend": /uːt/* "-esthetiek": /eɪst/Although they may look different at first glance, "/
tensie, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "tensie" and "joysticks" both start with the /ts/ or "tz" sound, which is considered to have similar characteristics in phonetics as they share the initial consonantal sequence of [t] followed by the dental sibilant [s]. This similarity makes them belong to the same category of sounds, despite being written differently due to linguistic differences between languages (Dutch vs English).<|eot_id|>
taswoning, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "taswonig" starts with the /t/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "vader", as in its prefix "/vd-". The rest of each word differs but they share this initial consonantal element. Justification: A phonetic analysis reveals that both words initiate with the voiced dental stop [d] or more specifically tʰasˈwoːnɪŋ (with h) for “tas
framepjes, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "framepjes" starts with the /f/ sound, which is a voiceless labiodental fricative (a type of consonantal sound). The second word, "wegdruip", also begins with this exact sound (/w/) in some dialects or accents of Dutch, but not necessarily universally accepted as such. However, for most standard pronunciations of modern Standard Dutch, both words start with the distinct sounds /frɛməˈ
disconterend, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "disconterend" begins with the /dʃ- (dish) sound, which is represented by the letters 'ds'. The second word "jut" starts with the /ʤt-(juh-tuh)t' sound, also beginning with the letter combination of 'jt'.Both words start with different sounds (/ʃ/ vs./ʤ/) but share similar starting sequences ('js-' in both cases), making them appear to have the same initial
jut, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "jut" and "invullen" (Dutch for "fill in") start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative phoneme.Justification:* The word "jut" starts with the letter combination "ju", which is pronounced as /ʤuːt/, where the initial "/ɟ/" represents a voiced postalveolar affricate.* In contrast, the verb "invullen" begins with the letters "in
etnisch, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "etnisch" starts with /tʃ/, which is a voiceless postalveolar affricate in IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet). The second word "ingestorte" also begins with /t/. Although the pronunciation might vary slightly depending on regional accents or individual speakers' pronunciations, both words start with the same consonantal phoneme, specifically the voiced dental stop /t/.Justification:In linguistics, when comparing sounds between
bijscholend, bolkaf, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "bijscholen" (to attend school) and "bolkafe" start with the /b/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "bijscholing" starts with the letter combination "bj", which is pronounced as a single unit in Standard Dutch pronunciation.	+ In phonetics, this would transcribe to [by] or [pʃ], where the initial stop [b] followed by the voiced fricative [j].*
vergokte, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "vergokte" and "detacheer" start with the letter combination /d/. The first word is spelled as "ver-gók-te", where "/v/" represents a voiceless labiodental fricative (the initial sound of English "vine"), followed by a glottal stop ("'") and then the voiced alveolar plosive (/t/) which sounds like the final part in American pronunciation.The second word is spelled as "de
kerstversierselen, korenzolders, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two phrases "kerstversierselen" and "korenzolders" both start with the letter combination /kr/. The sounds /r/ and /s/ are not identical, but they share the initial consonantal phoneme /k/, which is often referred to as the beginning of the word in linguistic analysis. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the Dutch words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound (/k/) even though their subsequent letters differ.<|eot_id|>
tensie, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "tens" in "tensië-" starts with /ts/, which is pronounced as [ts], whereas "" (voorraad) begins with "/v", which has a different phoneme than /ts/. Therefore, they do not start with the exact same consonantal sounds. However, if we consider only the initial stop consonants (/t/) instead of their actual pronunciation ([ts] vs [/v]), one could argue that both words technically share the starting
kuitharing, kemelsgaren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "kuitharing" and "kemelsgaren" both start with the /k/ consonant sound, which is identical in their initial sounds. This means that they share the same beginning phoneme (/p/, /t/, etc.) despite having different meanings. In this case, we can confidently say that yes, they do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
voedingssupplementen, voorlaatst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "voedingssupplementen" and "voorlaatst" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative sound.Justification:* The first word starts with "V", which is pronounced as /v/.* The second word also begins with "Vo", where the combination of letters represents a single phoneme (sound) in Dutch pronunciation.In standard IPA transcription (/), this would be represented as /foːr łaʸ
ritshouten, roep, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "rits" in "rittshouten" (which means to shout or scream) and "roep" in "roep" (meaning call or cry out loud) start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed 'R', which represents the voiced alveolar trill (/r/) phoneme in Standard Dutch pronunciation. This similarity in initial sounds meets the criteria for being considered as starting from the same conson
attentie, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "attentie" and "bedienaars" start with the /b/ or bilabial plosive consonant sound.Justification:* The word "attentie" starts with the letter combination "at", which is pronounced as a single phoneme (/ɑt/) in standard Dutch pronunciation.* In this case, the letters "a" and "t" together form a voiceless alveolar stop (the /t/ sound) followed by
computeriseer, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "computeriseer", starts with the /k/ sound (the voiceless velar plosive), while the second word, "-indeuk" is part of another compound word that begins with the /n- sounds (/nd/) followed by other phonemes. Since both start with different types of consonants (stop vs. nasal-consonantal cluster), they do not share the same consonant sound in their initial segments. However, if we
windbuksen, wijwatervat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "windbuksen" starts with the /w/ sound, which is also present in the second word "wijwatervat". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiced labiovelar approximant [ʷ].<|eot_id|>
kijktoestel, countryrock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kijk" (Dutch for 'look' or 'watch') and "country-rock" start with the /k/ consonant sound.Justification:In linguistics, phonetically similar sounds can refer to different letters in various languages but still share similarities based on their pronunciation. In this case, we're comparing two distinct entities: one is a word from the Netherlands ("kijk") while the other is not even a proper noun itself ('country-rock'). Nevertheless, when
loonde, lerarende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "loonde" starts with the /l/ sound, which is also present in the second word "lerarende". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/l/) making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
woelige, waaghalzerige, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "woelige" and "waaghalzerige" start with the /w/ sound.Justification: In the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), which is used to represent sounds in languages accurately, we can transcribe the beginning of each word as follows:* Woelig(e) = wɔəˈʁiġə* Waaghâlzerig(e) = waːxǎlzeˈrɪçəAs
degenstok, doemdenker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "degenstok" starts with /d/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "doemdenker". Both words start with the letter combination "dg", making them share the same initial consonant sound, represented by the phoneme /d/.<|eot_id|>
detacheer, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "detacheer" and "verlichtten" start with the /d/ or /tʃ/ (voiceless palatal stop) consonant sounds.Justification:* The first word is spelled as "detach-ee-r", which indicates that it starts with the letter combination "dt".* Similarly, the second word is spelled as "-v-er-l-i-c-h-t-en", indicating that it also begins with the letters "vr".In standard Dutch pronunciation
rechtstoestanden, rondbazuinende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "rechtstoestanden", starts with the /r/ consonant sound (the voiceless alveolar trill). Similarly, the second word, "rondbazuinende" also begins with the /r/ consonant sound. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/r/ in this case).<|eot_id|>
bekwaamden, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "bekwaamden" starts with the letter combination /bkw/, which contains the sounds /b/, /k/, and /w/. On the other hand, the second word "sciopticons" begins with the letters /skʲoɪpˈtɛknzən/. Although they may not look similar at first glance, both start with the /s/ or /sk/ phoneme (consonantal
attentie, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "attentie" and "brandverzekering" start with the /t/ or "tt" sounds.Justification:In Dutch phonology, the letter combination "at" is pronounced as [ɑˈtentiə] (ah-ten-tsee-u) in "attentie", which starts with a voiceless alveolar stop /t/. Similarly, in "brandverzekering", the word begins with the sequence "/br/" followed by
overlig, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "over" and "nadok" (I assume you meant to type "nadoek", which is not a common word in Dutch) start with the /v/ or /f/ sound.Justification:* The letter combination "ov-" in "over" represents the voiceless labiodental fricative phoneme (/v/) or sometimes also transcribed as /f/.* In standard pronunciation of "nadeuk" (a real word meaning 'needle'),
kamercommissies, kokkie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kamer" and "kokkie" start with the /k/ sound.Justification: The word "kamercommissies" starts with the letter combination "ka", which is pronounced as a single phoneme (/kɑ/) in Standard Dutch pronunciation guidelines (Nederlandse Norm voor de uitspraak van het Nederlands). Similarly, the word "kokkie" also begins with the letters "ko", which is again pronounced as a single phoneme (/
abstinentieverschijnsel, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "abstinentie" and "verwijning" start with different sounds, but not in their English transliterations. In reality:* "Abstinentie" starts with /ɑb- (a soft 'b' or almost like a vowel)* "Indeuk" is part of the word "onderscheiden", which means to distinguish; its first syllable "in-" has no distinct initial consonantal phoneme.However
evocerend, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "evocerend" starts with the /v/ sound (a voiced labiodental fricative), while the word "ontduik" also begins with the /n/ or /nt/ sounds which can represent as /t/. Although there is no exact match in terms of identical letters (/e-v/, /o-n-t-d-u-i-k/) both start with distinct but similar-sounding initial phonemes /v/t/ respectively
koffietafelde, kiezelbank, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "koffietafeld" starts with the letter combination "K", which is pronounced as /kf/. Similarly, the second word "kiezelbank" also begins with the letters "K", which again start with the pronunciation of /kf/, indicating that both words share the identical initial consonantal phoneme /k/ or /KF/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two Dutch words indeed commence with the same consonant sound.
jut, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "jut" and "verlegd" both start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative, which is often represented by the letter combination "vr". This means that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme. In this case, I justified my response as follows:1. The first word "jut" starts with the distinctively pronounced vowel-less 'ju' (as in English "just"), followed by the letters "-t
vaderschapsverlof, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "vaderschapsverlof" starts with the letter combination /vd/, which represents the voiced dental fricative (/dʒ/) followed by a voiceless labiodental approximant (/v/). The second word "jut" also begins with the letters "/jt/", where again, we have the sequence of sounds being the soft ch or yod-palatal stop (t͡ʃ) and then the al
dierlijke, dijkheemraadschappen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "dierlijke" and "dijkheemraadschappen" start with the /dʰ/ or voiced dental fricative (th) consonant sound.Justification:The first letter in each word is 'D', which indicates that they share the initial consonantal phoneme '/ð/' (voiced interdental stop). This means their sounds can be transcribed as [ˈdiɛrli̯kə] for "d
rechtstoestanden, ruilhandel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "rechtstoestanden" and "ruilhandel" start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "rechtstoestanden" begins with the letter combination "R-C-H", where "C" is pronounced as a hard palate click (a characteristic of many Germanic languages like English). This corresponds to the phoneme /kr/.* Similarly, the word "ruilhandel" starts with the letters "R-U-I-L".
roepzalen, ronddeelde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "roep" in "roepzalen" and "rondd" in "ronddedele" start with the /r/ consonant sound, which is similar to each other (albeit not exactly identical). The difference lies in their pronunciation, as "/p/" appears after "/" in "roep", whereas there's no such combination of sounds in "ronddedele". Nonetheless, at first glance or without further examination,
kijktoestel, conisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "k" in "Kijken-toestel" (Dutch for 'television set') and "ch" in "conisch" represent /kʰ/, which starts as a voiced velar stop followed by aspiration, effectively producing a similar consonantal sound at the beginning of each word. The slight difference between the two sounds lies only in their articulation; however, phonetically speaking, they share similarities enough to consider them starting from the same conson
psychoanalytici, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "psychoanalytic" (from English) and "jut" start with /p/, which is a similar or identical consonant sound.Justification: In phonetics, the initial sounds of two words can be compared by examining their place and manner of articulation. Both "/ps-" in "psychoanalytic" and "/" in "jut" represent voiceless bilabial stops (/bʰ), making them homorganic and thus starting with the same conson
doorkrabbende, domkapittel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "doorkrabben" (to rummage through) and "domkapitel" (chapter of fools) both start with the /dɔrk-ʁaˈbəndə/ and /dɛm-kaˈpitəl/ sounds respectively.The first word starts with "door-" which is pronounced as [dœɳk] in Modern Standard Dutch, while the second one begins with "Dom-", also
afgrijzenwekkendere, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "afgrijzen" starts with the /f/ consonant sound, while the second word "taswoning" also begins with the /t/ consonant sound. Although they don't share exactly the same letter (the letters 'f' and 't'), both sounds belong to the category of voiceless stops (/p/, /t/, /k/) in phonetics, which is often referred to as the [voiceless alveolar stop
zendamateurs, zondagcompetities, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The first word "zendamateurs" starts with /z/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "zondagcompetities". The similarity in their prefixes ("Zend-" and "Zon-") reinforces this observation. Therefore, my justification for saying yes to your question stands!<|eot_id|>
avondfeesten, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "avondfeesten" starts with /v/, which is also the beginning of the second word "voorlicht". Both words share the same initial consonantal phoneme, specifically the voiced labiodental fricative [v]. This indicates that they do indeed start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
vaandeldragers, veerschuiten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "vaandeldragers" starts with /v/, which is also the initial consonantal phoneme of the second word "veerschuiten". In both cases, we have the voiceless labiodental fricative [v] as their starting letter's pronunciation in Modern Standard Dutch (the standard dialect).<|eot_id|>
roep, rijpaard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "roep" and "rijpaard" both start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "roep" starts with the phoneme /r/, which is represented by the letter combination "rp".* Similarly, the word "rijpaard" also begins with the sequence of letters "rp", indicating that they share the same initial consonantal sound (/r/).<|eot_id|>
Jut, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "jut" (meaning'short' in English) and "schreeuw-" (the root of "screaming") both start with /xʃ/, which is often transcribed as "sh". In phonetics, this represents a voiceless postalveolar fricative or affricate [ʃ] sound, not to be confused with other possible sounds like /tɕ/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal
trompetbomen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "trompet", starts with the /tr/ consonant sound (the combination of t+r). Similarly, the second word, "statica" also begins with this exact same consonant sound (/st/) followed by another letter ("c"). Therefore, both words start with the same initial consonant sound which is /str/. However, I should note that in phonetics, we would consider them as starting with different sounds due to the difference between
kousenkoper, kinkhoren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "kousenkoper" and "kinkhoren" start with the letter combination /kn/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme in many languages, including English. The letters "c", "p", and "r" do not affect the initial consonantal quality of the word, so both words indeed share the same starting point, namely the sounds /kn/.<|eot_id|>
vaandeldragers, vat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "vaandeldragers" starts with /v/, which is also present in the second word "vat". Both start with the voiced labiodental fricative (/v/) followed by different vowels and subsequent sounds. Therefore, both words share this initial consonantal phoneme or sound, making them similar at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
roosterkozijn, rondschreeuwend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "rooster" begins with /r/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "ronDSchREEUWend". The difference lies in their pronunciation due to different diacritical marks (no mark for 'R' vs. capitalized 'D'). Despite this variation, both words share the initial consonantal phoneme /r/.<|eot_id|>
loodwitfabriek, lerarende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "loodwitfabriek" starts with the letter combination "L", which is pronounced as /l/. Similarly, the second word "lerarenende" also begins with the letters "Lr". Although there's another vowel ("a") in between them, both start with the distinct phonetic sounds of "/l/" (the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant) followed by different vowels and subsequent sounds. In linguistic terms,
peutercreche, petekinderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "peuter" and "pete-" in "petekinderen" start with the /p/ consonant sound.Justification: The letters "P", "E", and "T" at the beginning of each word make up the phonetic sequence "/pɛt-", which indicates that they share the same initial consonantal sound (/p/) followed by different vowel sounds. This similarity is evident even when considering diacritical marks (in this case, none)
maatregel, meetlinten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "maatregel" begins with the /m/ consonant sound, which is also present in the second word "meetlinten". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless bilabial stop /m/, making them share the same initial consonantal segment.<|eot_id|>
koelkamer, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "koelkamer" starts with the letter combination /k/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, representing the voiceless velar plosive (/k/) followed by schwa vowel (ə). Similarly, in the second word "naduk", we have two letters "/n/" starting together to form this exact same voiced alveolar nasal stop plus voicesss velar plosive (/ndʊk)/ or even more
vuilpersleiding, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "vuilpersleiding" and "invul" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative, which is considered to have the same phonetic quality in this case (the difference being that "vuilpersleiding" has multiple sounds before reaching the initial vowel). In linguistics, when comparing word initials for identicality, we focus on the primary place of articulation, manner, voicing, nasalization, etc., rather
rentetarieven, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "rentetarieven" starts with the /r/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "voorraad". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics: both words have initial sounds that can be transcribed as [r] (alveolar trill). Although there might be some slight differences between regional accents or individual pronunciations, linguistically speaking, they share the identical starting point - namely, the consonantal cluster
tachisme, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tachisme" starts with the /tʃ/ (ch) sound, while the word "esthetica" begins with the /ɛs/ (es) sound. Although they do not share identical letters ("c" vs. "e"), both sounds can be considered starting with similar voiceless postalveolar affricate (/tʃ/) or fricative-sibilant (/s/) initial segments, which is often referred to as
binnenstroomden, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "binnen" and "esth-" (from esthetic) start with the /bʃ/ or /bs/ phoneme.Justification:In the first word, "binnen", we have the letter combination "bn" which is pronounced as a voiceless postalveolar fricative ([s]) followed by a nasal stop (/n/) in Standard Dutch pronunciation.Similarly, in the second part of the compound noun "-esthe-tie-k" from French
voorlig, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voor" and "navel" both start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative consonant sound.Justification:In Standard Dutch pronunciation, the letter combination "voor" is pronounced as [foːr], where the initial vowel sound is long ([o:]) followed by a voiceless bilabial stop [/p/] and then another long close-mid back rounded vowel sound (/ɔ:/). The word starts with this distinct
peutercreche, permit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The first word "peuter" starts with /p/, which is also the beginning of the second word "permit". Both words have the initial consonantal phoneme /p/. Although they may not look identical, their sounds match when pronounced in English (the language I'm assuming we're using). In this case, both start with the voiceless bilabial plosive consonant /p/.<|eot_id|>
doodgeergerde, doffiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || After analyzing the provided Dutch words, I generated my response:**NO**Here's why: Although both "doorgeef" and "doffieren" start with the letter combination "dg", they have different pronunciations.* In "doorgeef," the letters "g" is pronounced as /x/, which is common in many Germanic languages.* On the other hand, in "doffieren," the sequence of sounds starts with a voiced dental fricative ([ð
toereikend, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "toereikend" and "taswoning" start with the /t/ sound.Justification:* The word "toereikend" begins with the letter combination "tr", which is pronounced as /t/.* Similarly, the word "taswoning" starts with the letters "ts", also pronounced as /t/.Since they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/t/) in their pronunciation, I conclude that yes, indeed, these two Dutch
onderligger, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "onder" in "onderligger" and "nadok" (not "nadoock", I assume that's just a typo) start with the /nd- or n-dh- combination of sounds which is represented by the letter pair "Nd". This means both words share the initial consonant sound /nd/.<|eot_id|>
machtigere, mentrix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "machtiger" (Dutch for "more powerful") and "mentorix" start with the /mh/ or /mch/ combination, which is pronounced similarly to the English letter pair "th". The initial sounds of both words share this similarity in their phonetic representation. In linguistic terms, they exhibit homorganicity at the beginning, indicating that they originate from the same place of articulation within the mouth when spoken aloud. This justifies my affirmative
uitrokend, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "uitrokend" begins with /ʊt/, which is pronounced as a combination of the letters 'u' and 't'. The word "voorraad" also starts with /vɔr-, vər-. Although both sounds may not seem identical at first glance, in phonetics, the /t/ sound in "uitrokend" can be considered similar to the /vr-/ sequence found in "vor-" (the prefix meaning
lekhoning, levensdrift, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "lekhoning" and "levensdrift" start with the /l/ sound.Justification: The first letter in each word is indeed 'L', which represents the voiced alveolar lateral approximant (/l/) phoneme in Standard Dutch pronunciation. This means that they share the initial consonantal component of their sounds, specifically starting with the /l/ consonant.<|eot_id|>
doortrapt, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "doortrap" and "donkern" start with the /d/ or dental stop consonant sound.Justification:In the first word "doorttrap", we have the letter combination "dt". The letters 't' is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar plosive (stop) which corresponds to the phoneme [t]. Similarly in the second word "donkeren", again there's another instance of the letter combinations starting from "dn
kielvlakken, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kiel" and "invullen" (not exactly "invul") both start with the /k/ or "cuh" sound.Justification: In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows:* Kiel: [kieːl]* Invullen: [ɪnˈvʏlə(n)]As you can see, they share the same voiceless velar stop (/k/) at
kolendampvergiftiging, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "kolendampvergiftiging" starts with /k/, while the second word "invul" also begins with /v/. Although they seem to have different letters, both start with sounds that can be represented by the phonetic symbols /k/ (or [k]) for "kolendampvergiftiging", which is pronounced as koh-len-dahmp-fuh-fee-gihng-ing, and /v/ for "
joysticks, avondfeesten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "joysticks" starts with /j/, which is pronounced as a voiced postalveolar affricate in English. The second word "avondfeesten", being of Dutch origin, also begins with /v/. While they may look similar at first glance due to their spelling similarity ("y" can sometimes represent both /iː/ and /ʏ/) or other reasons (e.g., phonetic transcription), linguistically speaking, /j/ and
huidworm, hartinfarct, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "huidworm" starts with the /hʃ/ (or /ks/) sound, which is pronounced similarly to the starting sounds of many English words that start with "ch". On the other hand, the second word "hartinfarct" begins with the voiceless alveolar fricative /t͡s/, often represented as "/ts/" in phonetic transcriptions or simply as "tz".Although both words
busziek, bijzettende, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "bus" starts with /b/, which is also the beginning of "/bij-". In phonetics, this means that both start with the voiceless bilabial stop consonantal sound [p]. This justifies my initial response as being correct.<|eot_id|>
superomroepen, cijfer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "superomroepen" starts with /s/, which is also the initial consonantal phoneme of the second word "cijfer". Although there's no exact identical letter (the letters 'p' in between), both sounds can be represented by the English alphabet as starting with the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/. This suggests that the two words share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
loonde, larken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "loonde" (pronounced as /luːndə/) and "larken" start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant consonantal sound, which in IPA transcription would be represented by "/kl/" or similar sounds. This means they share the same initial consonant phoneme, specifically the voiced labiodental fricative followed by the palatal nasal stop. In linguistic terms, this can also be referred to as a cluster
liefdesgevoelens, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "lief" (Dutch for love) and "statica" start with the /s/ or /ʃ/ phoneme in their respective pronunciations."Liev" is pronounced as [ˈliːf] with a voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) at the beginning."On statica", I assume you meant to say that's not even a word; if so, please ignore this part of your question! So,
planimetreer, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "planimetrie" begins with the /pl-=/ sound, which is pronounced as a voiceless labiodental fricative followed by a nasalized vowel (/pʰlænɪˈmɛtriə/).The second word "invullen" also starts with the /v-/ sound, which represents a voiced bilabial approximant (IPA: [f] or [b]) in this case since 'v' sounds
mannenhoofd, mentrix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "mannenhoofd" begins with /m/, which is also the first letter of the second word "mentrix". The justification for this conclusion lies in phonetics: both words start with distinct sounds that can be represented by letters from our alphabet system (in this case, 'M'). In linguistics, we consider two or more sounds as starting with the same consonantal sound if their initial segments share identical auditory features, such as place, manner,
noodschool, nawerpt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "noodschool" and "nawerpT" start with the /ndʒ/ or /d͡zɪŋ/ phoneme in English pronunciation.In Dutch orthography, "nsch" is often pronounced as [nt] before vowels (e.g., "inspectie"), which would also apply to this case since there's no vowel following the letter combination.Therefore, I conclude that indeed they do share the same initial consonant sound: /
jut, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "jut" and "omsingel" both start with the /ʤ/ or soft-dh sound, which is a characteristic of many English loanwords in Dutch that retain their original pronunciation from when they were borrowed into Middle Low German (MLG) during the High to Late Medieval period (~1200s). In this case, we can observe that the initial sounds of each word match exactly (/d͡ʒuːt/
liefkozend, larken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "liefkozend" and "LARKEN" start with the letter L.Justification: The first word is in Dutch ("liefkozend") and starts with the uppercase/Latin alphabet letter 'L', while the second one appears to be from English or another language (assuming you meant the verb "to larken", which means "to playfully tease"). In this case, we can compare them based on their written representation since they share similar spelling patterns.
toereikend, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "toereikend" starts with the /t/ sound, which is also present in the second word "invul". Both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonant phoneme /t/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal feature.<|eot_id|>
toereikend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "toereikend" and "statica" start with the /s/ or /st/ (in this case) phoneme.Justification:* The first word is spelled as "t-o-e-r-e-i-k-e-n-d", where you can see that there's no other consonantal combination before the vowel sounds.* Similarly for the second word: "s-t-a-t-i-c-a". Again, we have only one consistent consonantal sequence at the beginning
barkelners, busbanen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "barkelners" and "busbanen" start with the /b/ sound, which represents the beginning of their respective sounds in English pronunciation (the voiceless bilabial stop). In phonetics, this corresponds to the [p] or [b] allophone, where the tongue position doesn't change for either word at its onset. This means they share similar starting consonantal features despite being written differently due to language-specific spelling conventions.<|eot_id|>
dichtmaken, doorbladeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "dicht" and "doorbladeren" start with the letter combination "/d/", which is pronounced as /tʰ/. This means they share the same initial consonantal phoneme, specifically the voiceless dental stop [t]. Therefore, I conclude that both words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
warrelig, wegvretend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "warrelig" and "wegvretend" start with the /w/ or double-u (/uw/) phoneme in Dutch.Justification:In Standard Dutch pronunciation (the most widely recognized dialect), the sounds at the beginning of each word can be transcribed as:* War-rel-ig: /waːrəlɪx/* Weg-vre-tend: /ʋɛkˈfʁět�
warrelig, wegwerken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "warrelig" and "wegwerken" start with the /w/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is 'W', which represents the voiceless alveolar fricative phoneme in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation as '/w/'. This indicates that they share the same initial consonantal segment or onset, specifically the voiced labiovelar approximant [ʷ]. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two
regio's, roepzalen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "regio" starts with the /r/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "roep". Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound (/r/) despite being different letters (g and p). In phonetics, this phenomenon is called homorganic initial stops or stop-consonantal clusters. It means that although the individual sounds may differ in terms of their articulation, they share similar acoustic properties due to the shared
wijwatervat, worgkoorden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "wij" starts with /w/, which is also the beginning of the second word "wort". Both start with the voiced labial approximant consonant phoneme /w/.<|eot_id|>
trompetboom, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "trompet" starts with /tr/, which is pronounced as a single unit in English (a voiceless postalveolar affricate). Similarly, the second word "aanvrijl" also begins with /r/. Although there might be some subtle differences between the sounds due to language-specific characteristics like vowel quality or intonation, from a phonological perspective, both start with what can be considered the equivalent of the letter R,
kwintalen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kwintalen" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "esthetiek", starting from "/s". Although there's a slight difference in pronunciation (the first one being more guttural), both sounds can be considered as approximations to the English letter combination 'ks' or 'c'. Therefore, I conclude that they share similar initial consonantal characteristics.<|eot_id|>
wijngaardluis, wolfsangels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wijngaard" and "wolfsangel" start with the letter combination /wj/, which represents the voiceless labiovelar approximant [ʍ] or sometimes transcribed as /v/. This is because in some dialects of Dutch, particularly those spoken near the German border, the letters 'w' can represent this unique phoneme.Justification:1. The prefix "/wi-" appears at the beginning of both words.2. In standard Dutch
roep, rijksacademien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "roep" and "rijksschools-academieën" (which is how you would properly write out "Rijksakademiënen") both start with the /r/ sound, which is considered as one of the most common ways to transcribe this in phonetic notation systems like International Phonetic Alphabet(IPA). In IPA transcription for example, they can be written down respectively as [ʁoːp] and
bundeltje, bock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "bundeltje" begins with /b/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "bock". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics, where we can see that both words start with the voiceless bilabial stop /p/. This identical initial consonantal sound confirms my affirmative reply to your inquiry.<|eot_id|>
headlines, halfblind, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "headlines" and "half-blind" start with the /h/ sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed "H", which represents the voiceless glottal fricative phoneme in English orthography. This means that they share the identical initial consonantal feature (/h/) despite being different letters (the uppercase "H" vs. lowercase "h"). In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as homorganic initials or co-articulation between
wedergaf, wolfskuil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "wedergaf" begins with the /w/ sound, which is also present at the start of the second word "wolfskuil". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words share the initial labiovelar approximant /ʋ/, commonly transcribed as /v/. In English pronunciation, this can be represented by the letter combination 'w', hence my affirmative answer to your question.<|eot_id|>
radiostraling, roerhardere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "radiostraling" starts with the /r/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "roerharde". Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiceless alveolar trill /r/.<|eot_id|>
barkelners, bouwsels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "barkelners" (Dutch for "builders") and "bouwsels" start with the /b/ consonantal phoneme, which is pronounced as a voiced bilabial stop in Standard European Portuguese. This means that both words share the initial [b] sound, making them homophonous at this level of analysis. The rest of their sounds differ, but they do not affect how we categorize their beginning consonants based on our linguistic criteria
roofdierachtig, reddinggordel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "roofdierachtig", starts with the /r/ sound (a voiceless alveolar trill), while the second word, "reddings gordel" begins with the /r/ sound as well (again, a voiceless alveolar trall). Both sounds share the identical starting phoneme of /r/, which indicates that they start with the same consonant sound in this case.<|eot_id|>
kielvlak, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "kiel" in "kielvlak-" and "-ntd-" (part of "ontduik") start with the /k/ or /c/ sound, which indicates they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/klɛmə/) as described by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). In linguistics, this is known as homorganicity. The presence of other letters following the shared consonants does not change their identity.<|eot_id|>
dichtmaken, donderachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "dichtmaken" and "donderachtigste" start with the letter combination /dt/. This is because in many languages including Dutch, clusters of letters can affect how sounds are pronounced.Justification:* In Standard Dutch orthography, when two or more consecutive consonants appear together (like 't' followed by another stop like 'k', for instance), they often form a single phoneme, which means that speakers tend to pronounce them as one unit rather than
jut, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "jut" and "zenuwpijn" start with different letters, but they both have /tʃ/ or /tsch/ as their initial phoneme (sound). In Dutch orthography, the letter combination "tz" is often pronounced like a single voiceless postalveolar fricative [ts] or palato-alveolar affricate [t͡s], which can be approximated to English sounds such
ontroomt, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ontroomt" begins with /nt/, which is also the starting point of the second word, "navel". Both start with the nasal-consonantal combination "/n/" followed by the voiceless alveolar stop "/t/", making them share the same initial consonant sound (/nt/) despite being different letters in each case (the letter combinations "on", "tr") serving as prefixes to modify their meanings within those individual words.<|eot_id|>
vochtende, vakwerkconstructies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "vochtende" and "vakwerkconstructies" both start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative, which is considered as the same consonant sound in phonetics. This means that they share similar articulation features, including airflow direction (lateralized) and vocal tract constriction points. In linguistics, this similarity allows us to consider them starting from the same place of articulation, hence having the same initial conson
raagbollen, ruilhandel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "raagbollen" starts with /r/, which is also the initial consonantal phoneme of the second word "ruilhandel". In both cases, there's no other intervening sounds that would change or modify this initial /r/. Therefore, we can conclude that indeed, the two words start with the same consonant sound (/r/).<|eot_id|>
ingestorte, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ingestorde" and "-vorlig" start with the /v/ or voiced labiodental fricative (the 'v' in English) consonant sound.Justification: The first word is spelled as "ingestorde", which begins with the letters "i-n-g-" followed by other sounds that form part of its meaning. However, when we focus on just the starting letter combination ("in"), we can see that there's no audible difference between those two
delfstof, doffiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "delfstof", begins with /d/, which is also the starting point of the second word, "/doffig". Both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal phoneme represented by the letter combination "df" in English orthography. This justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
plantluis, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "plant" starts with /p/, which is also the beginning of the second word "/ontruimt". Both words start with the letter combination "pl", but in different positions, making them phonetically similar when pronounced together as one unit ("plant luis ontruimt"). This similarity can lead to confusion or mispronunciation if not considered carefully while reading aloud.<|eot_id|>
kerstversierselen, koortrans, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "kerst" (Christmas) in "kerstversierselen" starts with the /k/ sound, which represents the voiceless velar plosive phoneme (/p/, /tʃ/) or sometimes written as [k] in IPA notation. Similarly, "koor" in "koortrans" also begins with this exact same consonantal sound /k/. Therefore, they share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
uitreikend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "uitreikend" starts with the /uɪt-ʁeɪkənt/ sounds, which include the phonemes /u/, /t/, and /r/. Meanwhile, the second word "statica" begins with the /stæˈtikə/ sounds, featuring the phonemes /s/, /t/, and /k/. Although they don't share identical letters (since 'u' is not pronounced
versmaat, vuilakken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "versmaat" and "vuilakken" start with the /v/ consonant sound.Justification:The word "versmaat" begins with the letter combination "vr", which is pronounced as /vər/. Similarly, the word "vuilakken" starts with the letters "vl", also pronounced as /vʊlɑkən/. Since both words have the same initial phoneme (/v/) despite having different combinations of
uitreikend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "uit" in "uitenreikend" and "esth-" (short for esthetic) share the /uɪtʃ/ or "utch" sound.Justification: The prefix "uit" is pronounced as /uɪtʃ/, which starts with the voiceless postalveolar fricative [t͡ʃ] followed by the vowel sound /aɪ/. Similarly, when we break down the word "esthetic", its
nokte, neergerolde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "nokte" and "neergerolden" both start with the /nk/ or /ngk/ sounds, which can be considered as having the same consonant sound in this context. In phonetics, /nk/ is often transcribed as [ŋ] (a velar nasal) followed by a voiceless alveolar plosive [k]. This combination of sounds is commonly found together in many languages, including English ("sing
trompetboom, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "trompet" begins with the /tr/ sound (a voiceless alveolar stop followed by a voiced dental fricative), which is represented in the International Phonetic Alphabet as [ˈtrompət]. The second word "boom", when used as part of "trompetboom", also starts with this exact combination: /bʊm/. Although both sounds appear to start differently at first glance (/t/ vs./b
tensie, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "tensie-" and "-rotacisme" start with the /ts/ or /cʃ/ phoneme, which represents a similar consonant sound in this case. The letters 't','s' (in combination), and 'r' have distinct sounds when pronounced individually; however, their sequence can produce different outcomes depending on language rules and pronunciation variations. In this instance, we focus solely on whether they share a common initial consonantal quality
voorlegt, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "voorleg" starts with /v/, which is pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative (like in English "very"). Similarly, the second word "indeuk" also begins with /d/. Although they have different letters (/f"/ vs "/d"), both sounds share similar characteristics - being stops or affricates followed by vowels -, indicating that their starting points can be considered equivalent for phonetic purposes. Therefore, I conclude that yes,
wijkorgaan, waag, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wijkorgaan" and "waag" start with the /w/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "wijkorgaan" begins with the letter combination "wij", which is pronounced as /wiːk/, where the initial "wj" sounds like a single phoneme starting with the voiced labiovelar approximant [w].* Similarly, the word "waag" starts with the letters "wa", also pronounced as /
windbuksen, wegruimend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "windbuks" begins with /w/, which is also the starting letter of "/weg-" in "wegruimen". The "-nd", "-r-", or any other letters that follow do not affect whether two sounds start together, so we can focus on just comparing their initial phonemes (/w/) to determine if they share the same beginning. Since both have the identical initial sound '/w/', our conclusion stands: yes, those Dutch words indeed begin with the same
wandelpassen, wegruimend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "wandelpassen" begins with the /w/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "wegruimend". The justification for this answer lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless labiovelar approximant (/ʷ/) or bilabial-lip trill (the closest approximation to English 'w'). This similarity can help identify that they share similar initial sounds despite being different languages and having distinct meanings
kuitharing, koepelvormiger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "kuitharing", starts with the /k/ sound (a voiceless velar stop), while the second word, "koepelvormiger", also begins with the /k/ sound followed by another phoneme (/p/, which is not relevant to this question). Therefore, both words start with the identical consonantal beginning of /k/.<|eot_id|>
duif, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "duif" starts with /d/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "aanvijl". The letters 'a' in between do not affect the beginning sounds, as they represent vowel phonemes (/ɑː/) that come after the initial consonantal onset /d/. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound "/d/" or [t].<|eot_id|>
woudduivel, wolkachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "woudduivel" and "wolkachtigste" start with the letter combination "/wu/", which represents the same consonant sound.Justification:The word "woudduivel" begins with the letters W-U-D (representing the sounds /w/, /ʊ/, and /d/) while "wolkachtigste" starts with the letters W-O-L-K-A-C-H-T-I-G-S-T-E (where we can ignore the
ordenden, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "ordenen" begins with /r/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the second word "invullen". Therefore, I can confidently say that both words start with the same consonant sound (/r/) in this case. Justification: The sounds /rdn/ (in "ordenen") and /rvl/ (in "invulen") share the identical initial consonance, i.e., /r/. This similarity indicates that the
kielvlakken, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "kielvlakken" starts with the /k/ sound, which is a voiceless velar plosive in phonetics (represented by [k]). Similarly, the second word "zenuwpijn" also begins with the /z/ sound, but since we're asked about starting sounds that may not necessarily match exactly at the letter level, I'll consider only the initial consonantal quality of each word. In this case, both
regelingen, rechtstoestanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "regelingen" and "rechtstoestanden" start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is 'R', which represents the identical consonant sound in phonetics (/r/) in this case.<|eot_id|>
wildspiegels, wegruimend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "wild" in "wildspiegels" starts with /w/, which is also the beginning of "/weg-" in "wegruimend". The initial letters share the exact same phonetic value, being the voiced labial approximant (/w/) followed by different vowels ("ild", respectively).<|eot_id|>
lispen, larken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "lispen" starts with the /l/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "larken". Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
kreupelbossen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "kreupel" and "esthetica" start with the /k/ or /kr/ sound.Justification: The word "kreupel", which is part of the phrase "kreupelbossen", starts with the letter combination "KR". Similarly, the first syllable in the compound noun "Esthétique" (in French) becomes "Esthe-tic-a" when translated to English as "esthetic(a)". In this case, we can focus
interimaat, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "interimaat" and "invul" start with the /n/ or nasal sound, which makes them share the same initial consonant sound. The word-initial letters may differ (i.e., 'in' vs. 'iv'), but their phonetic value remains consistent in this case, being pronounced as the same sound (/n/) by native speakers of Dutch.<|eot_id|>
loonde, lafste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "loonde" begins with the /l/ sound (a voiced alveolar lateral approximant), which is also present in the beginning of the word "lafste". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the letter combination "L", where "L" represents the voiceless or voiced postalveolar lateral fricative sounds. This similarity indicates that their initial letters share similar acoustic properties, making them homophonous
machtigere, melkkuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "machtiger" (meaning'more powerful') and "melkkuur" ('a milk cure' or possibly 'dairy treatment', depending on context) start with the /m/ sound, which represents a voiced bilabial stop in phonetics. This makes them share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
taswoning, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "taswoning" starts with the /t/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "navoelen". In fact, both words start with the exact same phoneme (/t/) in this case. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
ontroomt, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "ontroomt" starts with /n/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "indeuk". The justification for this answer lies in phonetics, as both words start with distinct sounds represented by letters 'o', 'nt' (which together form /nt/) followed by different vowels ('r'o'm't' vs.'i'n'd'e'u'k'). Although they don't have identical spellings or exact pronunciation due to language-specific differences between
leugenachtigste, laagstammigst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "leugen" and "laagstammigst" start with the /l/ sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of two or more words can be compared by examining their place and manner of articulation (POA). In this case:* The word "leugen" starts with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant /ʟ/, which is represented as "L" in the International Phonetic Alphabet.* Similarly, the compound
piepjongst, kelderdeur, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "piepjong" starts with /p/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "kelder". Therefore, both words share the beginning consonant sound "/p/" or more specifically, their initial phonemes (/piɛpmoŋg/ and /ˈkel.dər/) start with the voiceless bilabial plosive stop [p].<|eot_id|>
verluchtten, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "verluchtten" starts with the letter combination /vər/, which includes the sounds "/v/" (voiced labiodental fricative) followed by the vowel schwa (/ə/) and then another consonantal element ("r"). On the other hand, the second word "Esthetic-a" begins with the letters "E-s", where both elements start with distinct phonemes; there is no shared consonant in their initial positions.
lieveling, leemaarde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "lieveling" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present in the second word "leem-aarde". The presence of this common consonantal element justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
doopheffer, domkapittel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "doof" (beginning of "doopheffer") starts with /dʊf/ sound, which is pronounced as [duːv]. The second word "domkapittel" begins with "/dm/" sounds, which can also be transcribed to [dt] in IPA notation, meaning both start with similar dental or alveolar stop consonants ("t", but note that this might not exactly match due to phonological differences). Note
doorbladeren, donkerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "doorbladeren", begins with the /d/ consonant sound.The second word, "donkerden", also starts with the /d/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound (/d/).<|eot_id|>
naduiken, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "naduiken" starts with the letter combination "nd", which represents the /nðʊkɛn/ sounds in English, where both letters contribute to forming one distinct phoneme (a voiced dental nasal). Similarly, the second word "invul" also begins with the letter combination "nv", representing the /invʌl/ sounds again showing how two letters come together to form a single unit of pronunciation. Since they share
wegdruip, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wegdruip" and "interimaat" start with the /w/ or voiced labiovelar approximant phoneme.Justification:In the first word, "weg", starts with the letter combination of W-E-G which is pronounced as /weɣ/. The second part "-druip" also doesn't change this pronunciation.Similarly in the second word "interi-maat". It begins with the letters I-T-R-I-MAA
psychoanalytici, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "psychoanalytisch" (psychological) and "bekwamen" (are competent or capable of) start with the /b/ consonant sound.Justification: The first word starts with the letter combination "ps", which is pronounced as /sʏ/, but since this combination often represents the voiceless bilabial stop consonant /p/ in many languages including English, we can assume that's how to transcribe its pronunciation for phonetic purposes.
nadook, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "nad" in "nadook" and "invu-" in "invul" start with /nd/, which represents the same consonant sound, specifically the voiced dental nasal stop (/nd/) followed by a voiceless alveolar fricative (/v/). In phonetics, this combination of sounds can be represented as [ndʋ]. Although they appear differently written due to language-specific spelling conventions (Dutch uses -dd- for what
crisisteam, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "crisitsteam" starts with the /k/ or /kr/ sound (depending on how one pronounces 'cristi'), while the second word "nadook" also begins with the /n/ sound followed by another vowel (/d/) which doesn't affect its initial consonantal quality. Therefore, both words start with different sounds in their phonetic transcription. However, if we consider only the very beginning of each word -
ranchers, roze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "ranchers" (from English) and "roze" (Dutch for "pink") start with the /r/ consonant sound, which makes them share this phonetic characteristic despite being from different languages. The sounds in question are voiceless alveolar trill approximants [ʁ] or voiced postalveolar non-continuant [ɹ]. In linguistics, such similarities across language boundaries can facilitate borrowing between languages.<|eot_id|>
bekwaamden, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "bekwaamd" begins with the /b/ sound, which is also present in the word "vooral". The justification for this lies in the fact that both words start with the letter combination "/bkw/" (or more accurately, [p] or voiceless bilabial plosive) followed by different vowels (/a:/ and /oːr/, respectively). This similarity suggests that their initial sounds share the common feature of being voiced stops
radiostraling, reddingstoestellen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "radiostraling" starts with the /r/ sound, which is also present in the second word "reddingstoestellen", starting at "/rd/" (which sounds like /rɛd/) followed by other letters. The initial consonantal sequence of both words shares the identical phoneme /r/. Therefore, I conclude that they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
wegdropen, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "wegdropen" starts with the /w/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "voorgelgt". Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal sound (/w/) despite having different meanings in their respective contexts.<|eot_id|>
piepjongst, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "piep" starts with the /p/ sound, while the second part of the compound noun "-jongst-" does not have any significant effect on the initial consonantal phoneme since it is a prefix-like element that doesn't change or modify the starting point of articulation in this case (the whole term would still start as "/piɛp/" with a voiceless bilabial plosive). Finally, the suffixes like -est
jut, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "j" in "Jut-" and "k" in "-kwinta-len" represent distinct sounds, specifically /dʒ/ (a voiced postalveolar affricate) for "j", and /k/ (voiceless velar stop) respectively. Although they appear similar visually as single letters, their phonetic values differ, making them not identical or interchangeable within the context of English pronunciation rules. However, if we consider only the initial letter
toereikend, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "toereikend" and "Esthética" start with the /t/ or dental stop consonant.Justification:In the word "toereikend", the first letter is indeed 'T', which represents the voiceless alveolar plosive (/t/) phoneme in Standard Dutch.Similarly, in the word "Esthétique", although written as 'E' (which might seem like it starts with a vowel), its pronunciation begins with a slight
kielvlak, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "kielvlak" starts with the letter combination "k", which is pronounced as /k/. Similarly, the second word "invul" also begins with the letters "i-v-l", but when spoken together, they start with the sounds of the individual phonemes /v/, not /k/. However, in some dialects or accents, especially those where the voiceless velar stop (/p/) has been assimilated to become voiced (like
havengebouw, hangoortafels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "haven" in "havengbouw" and "hangen" in "hangoortafels" start with the /h/ sound.Justification: The letters 'H' appear at the beginning of each word, which indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/h/) in their pronunciation. In linguistics, this is known as homorganic initials or identical onset sounds between two morphemes (words). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the
wegdruip, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "wegdruip" and "invul" start with the /v/ consonant sound.Justification:In the first word, "wegdruip", the letters 'w' is often pronounced as a voiced labiodental fricative (/v/) in many languages including English.Similarly, In the second word, "invul", the letter combination 'iv' also starts with the voiceless velar stop followed by the voiced labiodental approximant
lucifersmerken, lendeberoerte, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The first word "lucifersmerken" starts with the letter combination /lj/, which is pronounced as a single sound like 'ly'. Similarly, the second word "lende-beroerte" also begins with the letters "/ld/" or "/l/", depending on how you pronounce them in English (as both options would result in similar sounds), but ultimately, we can consider them starting with the consonant sound '/l/'. Therefore, based on their
zenuwpijn, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "zenuwpijn", begins with the /z/ sound (a voiced alveolar fricative), which is represented by the letter combination "zn". The second word, "vergokte", also starts with this exact sound (/z/) as well. Therefore, both words share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
brandverzekering, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "brandverzekering" starts with /br/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, whereas the second word "esthetica" begins with /es/. Although they do not share identical letters (/b/ vs. /s/), their sounds can be approximated to have similar starting points in terms of English pronunciation (both start with something like a soft 'b' or 'psssh'). This might indicate that both words initiate with the
veerschuiten, voorlaatst, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "veer" in "veerschitten" (Dutch for 'bicycles') and "voor" in "voorlaatst" ('for last time' or 'finally', depending on context) start with the /vərʃ/ sound, which is pronounced as a soft "ver" followed by a slight vowel-like quality (/ɛ/) before returning to its original sharpness at the end of each syllable. The shared
weergeving, wegruimend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "weergeving" begins with the /w/ sound, which is also present at the start of the second word "wegruimend". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words have initial sounds that belong to the voiced labiovelar approximant category (/w/) or voiceless alveolar fricative (//) respectively.<|eot_id|>
huilerigheid, haverpluim, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "huilerigheid" begins with the /h/ sound, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "haverpluim". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless glottal fricative [h], making them share the identical initial consonantal sound (/h/) despite having different meanings and endings (-heids vs -pluum).<|eot_id|>
warrelig, watertanden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "warrelig" starts with /w/, which is also the starting point of the second word "watertanden". Both words share the initial consonantal phoneme "/w/", making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
trompetbomen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "trompet", starts with /tr/, which is a combination of two sounds in English (the voiceless alveolar stop 't' followed by the voiced labiodental fricative 'r'). Similarly, the second word, "esthetica" begins with /s/. Although they have different letters at their beginning ("T" vs. "S"), both start with a similar place-of-articulation for the initial consonantal sound
negerwijk, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "neger" and "-vorleg-" in "voorlegt" start with the /v/ or /f/ phoneme.Justification:In standard Dutch pronunciation, the letter combination "g" is often pronounced as a soft guttural stop (like the German ch) before back vowels like "e", which can make it seem to some non-native speakers that they hear a different initial consonantal sound than what's written. However, linguistically speaking, this does
lieveling, lekhoning, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "lieveling" and "lekhoning" start with the letter combination /l/. This means they share the same initial consonantal phoneme.Justification:* The word "lieveling" starts with the letters L-I-E-V.* The word "lekhoning" also begins with the letters L-K-H-O-N-G (ignoring silent or non-phonetic characters).* Despite having different sequences of subsequent sounds after the first letter(s), both words
tensie, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "tensie" and "bedrijven" start with the /t/ consonant sound.Justification: The first word is "tensie", which begins with the letter combination "ts". Although this might seem like two separate sounds (/t/ followed by /s/,), in many languages (including English) when we have consecutive identical letters or digraphs that represent single phonemes, they can still share similar articulation characteristics, making them functionally equivalent to
duivelsklauw, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "duivelsklauw" starts with /d/, which is also the beginning of the second word "/detacheer". Both words share the initial consonantal phoneme /d/.<|eot_id|>
lijkende, lacto-vegetarier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "lijkende" and "lactovegetariër" both start with the letter combination /lj/. This is because in the Dutch language, 'j' can sometimes represent a soft pronunciation of the letters 'g', which results in this unique starting sound.Justification:* The word "lijkende" starts with the prefix "lijk", meaning similar or alike.* In standard spelling rules for Dutch, when followed by another vowel (in this case "-
doorstuur, donderachtigste, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "doorstuur" and "donderachtigste" start with the /d/ sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is indeed "D", which represents the voiceless alveolar stop in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) notation as [t]. This indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme or speech sound, specifically the dental stop /d/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, both words do commence with the identical consonant sound
taswoning, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "taswoning" starts with the /t/ sound, while the second word "vadervreugde" also begins with the /v/ sound. Although they have different letters (/t/ vs./v/) that represent distinct sounds in phonetics (alveolar stop [t] versus labiodental fricative [f]), both start with what is commonly referred to as a voiceless alveola/fricative sound when pronounced by
rotacisme, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "rotacisme", begins with the /r/ sound (the letter combination 'rt' is pronounced as a single voiceless alveolar trill), while the second word, "vuilpersleiding", starts with the /v/ sound. However, in some dialects of Dutch, particularly those spoken near the German border or among older speakers, there can be a tendency to pronounce initial voiced labiodental fricatives like /v/ more closely
etnisch, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "etnisch" starts with the /ɛt/ (or sometimes written as /ĕt/) sound, which is pronounced like "ett". Similarly, the second word "ordende" also begins with the /r/ sound. Although they have different meanings, both words start with distinct but similar sounds in their beginning letters ("T" and "R"), respectively. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two Dutch words do share the same
meetlinten, melkkuur, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "meetlinten" starts with /m/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "melkkuur". Both words have the initial sounds pronounced as /m/. Therefore, they share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
