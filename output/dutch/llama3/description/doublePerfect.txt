zenuwpijn, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "liefdesgevoelens" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables' phonetic structure. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of similar vowels (identical or very close) with distinct following consonantal sequences.The word "zenuwpijn" ends with "-ijn", which contains the diphthong /ij
kolendampvergiftiging, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "kolendampvergiftiging" and "invullen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending parts where they share similar characteristics such as having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and consonant sounds (diphthongs). The word "kolendampvergiftiging" ends with "-ving", which is composed of 'g' sound at the end while on
boerenfluitjes, puitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "boeren" ends with "-oren", which has the sound /ɛrən/, while the word "puitje"sends with "-uitje", which also has the same ending sound of /uːitʃə/. This meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, where two words can rhyme if they end with different consonants but share the same vowel sound(s) or diphthongs (in this case,
vooreinde, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vooreinde" and "in-deuk" do rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is determined by whether two or more words share similar ending sounds, typically involving vowels (A/E/I/O/U) accompanied by one or more consecutive consonantal phonemes (/p/, /t/, etc.). In this case,* Both "vooreinde" and "ind-euk" end with the diphthong combination "-eu".* The
gemeste, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "gemeste" ends with the sound /ste/, which consists of two distinct consonants (/s/ and /t/) plus the same vowel sound (the schwa, or unstressed 'e').* "statica", on the other hand, also has a similar structure: three letters that form one syllable ("sta") + another set of vowels/consonants ("-tica").Since both words end in dissimilar consonantal combinations (-te vs
voorlegt, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Voorleg-: The word starts with "voor" which ends in the sound /r/.2. vadervreugd-e: This part of the word also has the same ending, "-e", which indicates that they share similar characteristics.3. Both vowels ("o" and "u") come after their respective consonants ("v" and "d"), indicating rhyming behavior according to standard linguistic rules for English (and potentially
psalmodieren, denuncieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psalmodieren" and "denun-cieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (the part of speech that contains vowels) for matching patterns. The key characteristic is whether they share similar consecutive letters or diphthongs at the end ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds").The word "psalomodieren" ends with "-dieren
reproducenten, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "reproducenten" ends with the sound /n/.* The word "aanvijlen" (note: I assume this should read "aanvijl", not "aenvijl") also ends with the letter combination "-il".According to the rules of rhyming in Dutch, two words can be considered rhymes if they end with different consonants but share the same vowels that follow those consonants. In
prevenierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "prevenierend" and "distanteriennd" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share the same ending sound (the diphthong "-ie-" or its variant) with distinct initial consonantal patterns preceding them. Both words end with this specific suffix (-ie-), while their respective prefixes ("prep-", "distan-") differ significantly. This satisfies the definition of rhything in
joysticks, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joystick" (pronounced as [jɔyˈstik]) and "zettingen" ([zɛtəŋən]) do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two Dutch words to rhyme, they need to end with similar sounds that include both vowels and consonants. In this case, while both words share the same ending sound "-ijken", their preceding consonantal parts differ: "stick-" in "joystick
trompetbomen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "trompet" and "invullen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to examine their final syllables' phonetic composition. In this case,* The word "trompet" ends with "-et", which has distinct letters.* The word "invullen" is misspelled; I assume you meant "invullen". This word also ends
Batavieren, scholieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Batavieren" and "scholieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (and many other languages), they typically need to share similar or identical ending phonemes after their final vowels. In this case:* The word "Batavieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /ərɛn/.* The word "scholieren" also ends with "-eren", but its pronunciation is
schreeuweriger, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "schreeuw" in the first word has the sound /erəʊ/* "-riger" also has the same ending with the sound /rɪgəʁ/* The second word, "indeuk", ends with "/døk"As you can see, both parts of the comparison ("-ier" and "-dek") end with the vowels "i" (long) and then respectively "rig-" and "
rentetarieven, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch phrases "rentetarieven" and "voorraadig" do not perfectly match in terms of rhyming, but they share the same ending sound "-ieven". This is because both words end with the suffixes "-tieven" (in this case) which has its own distinct phonetic characteristics that can make them appear to rhyme despite having slightly varying meanings. However, upon closer inspection, we find differences between their respective initial consonantal clusters
spalieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "spal" in "spalieren" ends with the sound /l/2. The last part "-eren" has the same ending, which also includes the letter combination "/r/".3. Both parts end with the vowels "a" and the consonant "n".Since they share similar endings (/ln/) after their respective rhyming syllables ("pal-" and "levi-", both containing the letters "p", "
plantluis, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plant", "luis" and "ontruimt" do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* The last syllable of each word is pronounced similarly: /ʌnt/, /uɪs/, and /mənt/. These pronunciations share similar vowels (the diphthong "ui" in "Luis" can approximate to [ʊ] or [i], which would still match with "/a/" and "/e�
geitereerde, deprivatiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "geiterateerd", ends with the sound "-eerde".* The second word, "deprivaatisereed", also ends with the same sequence of sounds: "-ee-ree".Since they both end in the exact same pattern (different consonants preceding the vowels "-e"-"i"-R"), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition you provided for rhyming in Dutch language.<|eot_id|>
europeaniserend, proclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "European" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the vowels "e" and the double consonant "rn".* "Proclaimer" ends with the sound "-erend", which also has the vowels "e" and the double consonant "r".Since they both end with the same combination of vowel-consonant sounds, namely "-eernd", we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the traditional definition of rhyming
kwartieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "kwartieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which consists of two consecutive vowels ("er").2. Similarly, the word "schapuleren" also ends with the same sequence: "-eren".3. Since both words share this ending pattern (-ere), they can be considered to rhyming in terms of their final syllables (i.e., having different consonants preceded by identical vowel-consonant combinations).Therefore
composteerden, collaboreerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word, "composteren", ends with the suffix "-eert" which indicates that its final syllable has the sound /ərt/.2. Similarly, the second word, "collaboreren", also ends with the same suffix "-ereen".3. Since both words end with the same sequence of vowels (-ee) and consonants (r), they meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different initial conson
jut, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "jut" ends with the sound /t/, which has no matching partner in the other two-word combination, while they both end with either "/pɪn/" or "/wyn/", respectively, sharing similar phonetic characteristics (identical vowels and consonant sounds). In linguistics, this phenomenon of having distinct yet related sounds at the ending part of words is known as rhyming. The criteria for perfect rhymes include:1. Identical
welbedachte, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "welbedacht" ends with the sound "-edakt", which has the same vowels ("a") but different consonants ("-d-" vs.-r").* Similarly, the word "ontroomt" also ends with the sound "-oomt", where again we see the same vowels ("o") but distinct consonants ("-m-" & -n").According to this criteria of having different consonants preceded by identical vowel-consonant combinations
scholieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "scholieren" and "saffieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the "-eren" suffix.* The final vowels in both words ("i" and "e") are pronounced similarly (identical).* Although they share some similarities, their prefixes differ: "scholi-" vs. "sa-". This means that when we look at the entire word, including its prefix, we can conclude that despite having similar endings (-
harmonierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "harmonierend" and "solfegierend" do not rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-nd", which is similar but not exactly identical.	+ In both cases, there's no difference in vowels (both use "e").	+ However, they differ in their final consonantal sound: -r- for "harmonierend" vs. -g- or possibly -j- depending on pronunciation of "s
neomisten, vernisten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "neomisten" ends with the sound "-en", which consists of the letter combination "n-e-m".* The word "vernisten" also ends with the same sound, namely "-ernsten", where again we see the sequence "r-n-s-t".Although they share similar endings (-en vs -ernsten), there's still some difference in their final consonantal sounds (m vs s/t). This meets one condition for rh
liefdesgevoelens, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "liefdesgevoelens" and "ontruimt" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "liefdesgevoelens" ends with "-s", which is a distinct sound from the ending of "ontruimt", which is "-mt".* Although both words end in -en (a suffix indicating plural or diminutive form), this does not necessarily mean they share similar rhyming patterns.	+ In general
gehydrateerde, gerendeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "gehydrateerd" ends with the sound /deːrd/* "gerenederd" also ends with the same sound /deːrd/Since they share the same ending, which consists of identical vowels (/e/) and consonents (/r/, /d*/), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the traditional definition in English (and many other languages). This property holds true for both European and African varieties
duif, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "duif" and "dienst-roosters" can be analyzed as follows:* Both end with the suffix "-f", which is considered to be part of their final sound.	+ In both cases, this suffix ends in /f/.	+ The preceding vowels ("u-" in "duif" and "" (the silent e) before -roost- in "dienst-roosters") also share similar qualities:		- They're
ontsieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffix "-n" in both "ontsiren" and "manieren" has the same sound, which means they share similar phonetic properties (the combination of vowels and consonants). In this case:* The final syllables ("-ren") end with the /ərn/ sequence.	+ "/r/" represents the voiced alveolar trill or flap, respectively, for each word.    + Both instances use the schwa (/ə/)
crediterend, polemiserend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffix "-erend" in both "crediterend" and "polemiserend" has the same ending sound /-rɛnd/. The prefix differences ("cre-" vs. "po-", "dit-" vs. "pol", etc.) do not affect this shared feature, which defines rhyming according to your request. In linguistics, phonological similarity like this would indicate perfect rimes or end-rhymes between two words.<|eot_id|>
joysticks, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the pair of words "joystick" (Dutch: "stok") and "naduk", they both end with "-ik". The final syllables in each word share similar sound patterns, specifically:* Both ends with the letter combination "-ik"* The preceding vowels ("o" and "a") change but maintain their respective phonetic values* No changes occur to the following consonantal letters or diphthongs within this comparisonAccordingly,
verteerden, distingeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word, "verteerden", ends with the sound /n/.2. The second word, "-distingeerden" (note that I assume you meant to write this in its entirety: "onderscheiden"), also ends with the same sequence of phonemes (/nd/) which can represent one single unit for rhyming purposes.3. Although they share similar endings (-r-den), their initial parts differ significantly ("vert-" vs
loopgravenstellingen, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last three syllables "etnisch" end with "-sch", which has the same sound as the final suffixes in some other Dutch nouns, such as -tjesch or -schen (e.g., appel-tjesch = little apples). The ending of each word also follows this pattern: - etnisch ends with "-ich"- stellingen ends with "-ingen"- gravenstellingen ends with "-ten"In
kohieren, ontsieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "kohieren" ends with the sound /iren/.2. "ontsieren" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes, namely "/tsiərən/".3. Since they share the same ending vowels (/en/) and preceding consonant groups (the combination of voiced stops and fricatives), we can conclude that they do indeed exhibit rhyming characteristics in Dutch language. The differing initial consonantal clusters ("
passagieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the pair of Dutch words "passagieren" and "brevieren", we can identify similar rhyming patterns:* Both end with "-eren"	+ The last two letters ("-en") form a distinct sound	+ This pattern matches the definition of rhymin'g, where differences exist between preceding consonants but not after vowels or consonants (identical V&Cs)So, according to this criterion, they do indeed share
suggereerde, gepedaleerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "suggereerde" and "gedelegerde" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share the same ending sound with at least one of their last three letters being identical (in this case, "-ede"). Additionally, the preceding consonants differ between the two words ("g-" vs. no consecutive consonants), satisfying another key characteristic of Dutch rhymes. Therefore, I conclude that "suggereerde"
tensie, gelukzoekster, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "gelukzoekster" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two Dutch words to rhyme, they need to end with the same sequence of vowels (including diphthongs) and consecutive consonantal sounds. The word "tensie" ends in "-sie", while "gelukzoekster" ends in "-ter". Although both endings contain similar sounding letters ("s"), they differ significantly enough that they don't meet the
recreeerden, geitereerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "recreeerden" and "geiterateerd" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is defined as having similar or identical sound in the final syllables of two or more words. In this case, both words end with "-ereed", which meets one criterion for rhyming (different consonants).Furthermore, when we examine their ending vowels ("e") and following consonents ("-re"), they share identical phonetic values
antwoordend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "antwoordend" and "aanvijlen" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "antwoordend" ends with "-nd", which has distinct consonantal sounds.* On the other hand, the word "aanvijlen" also ends in "-njl". Although they both contain vowels ("e"), their final parts ("-nd" vs. "-nj") differ significantly due to the presence of unique consonant combinations (the nasal sound
associeren, affilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "associeren" ends with the sound "-eren".* The word "affilieren" also ends with the same sound "-ilen", which can change to "-iren" in some cases, but still retains similar ending patterns.* Although they don't share exact consonantal endings (-ren vs -len), both suffixes follow the pattern of having distinct consonants leading up to the final vowels ("-o-" or "-i-", respectively)
knietjes, bandietjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kniet" has the sound /nɪtʃəs/	+ The final consonant cluster "-itj-" consists of two distinct sounds: /t͡ʃ/ (a voiceless postalveolar affricate) and -j-.* "bandi" also ends with the same consonant cluster "-ij-", which represents the same sequence of phonemes (/d͡zi/) in this context,
distingeerden, respireerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "distingeerden" and "respireerden" do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* The final syllable of both words ends with "-eren", which means they share the same ending sound.	+ In "distingeerden", the last two letters ("-en") form a single phoneme /ɛn/, where the vowel is pronounced as [ə] (a neutral schwa).	+ Similarly, in "respireerden
doodsprentjes, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "doodsprentjes" ends with the sound /sɛrənts/	+ It has the consonant combination "-st-" which produces the distinct phonetic value of [t]	+ Following that, there's the long-vowel sound "/e/" (the letter 'e' pronounced like in English)	+ And finally, ending with the nasalized-sound "/ts/"* The second word "nad
repliceren, declareren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "repliceren" ends with the sound "-ieren", which has the final syllable's vowels ("i") being pronounced.* Similarly, the word "declareren" also ends with the same suffix "-ieren".* Since both words share the same ending pattern (-ieren), they meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different initial consonants but sharing identical vowel-consonant combinations at their end.In this case,
meridionaal, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "meridionaal" and "zouterijen" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share the same ending sound consisting of at least one consonant plus any number of vowels (known as a syllable-final cluster). In this case:* Both words end with "-aal" or "-ien", respectively.* The final consonantal part is distinct: "l" vs. "n".* However, both
spalieren, spieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "spalieren" ends with the sound /nɛrən/.* The word "spieren" also ends with the same sound, namely /nɛrən/.Since they both end with the same combination of vowels (the diphthong "er") and consonents ("rn"), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified: having different consonants but following them up with
tempelieren, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "tempelieren" ends with the sound "-iren".* The word "slamieren" also ends with the same sound "-iren".As they both end in the exact same sequence of vowels (-i-) and consonants (rn), we can conclude that their final syllables do indeed share similar phonetic characteristics, specifically having different consonants preceded by identical vowel-consonant combinations ("-ier"). This meets one condition for rhym
kohieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kohieren" and "scharnieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming requires that they end with similar phonetic patterns at their final syllables (consonantal sound + vowel sound). Specifically, for two words to rhyme, we need them to share the same ending vowels ("ee", "ie", "ui") or diphthongs (like "ouw"), accompanied by distinct conson
dieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dieren" ends with the sound /nɪərən/, while the word "passagieren" ends with the sound /ˈpasɑʃiərn/. Since they do not share similar ending vowels or consonant combinations, we can conclude that they don't technically rhyme in the classical sense of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (different CVC patterns). However, I would say that for practical purposes,
abeeltjes, smeeltjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "abeeltjes", ends with the sound /tʃɛs/, where "/t/" represents the voiceless alveolar stop, "/ch" represents the palatal affricate, "/"ɛ"/ represents the open mid front unrounded vowel, and "/s/" represents the voiced postalveolar fricative.* The second word, "smeeltjes", also ends with the same sequence of sounds
incrusteerden, suggereerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "incrusteren" and "suggeren" do not rhyme.Justification:In rhyming in languages like English or Germanic ones (including Dutch), typically requires that both words end with similar sounding vowels as well as consonantal suffixes. In this case:* The word "incrusteren" ends with "-n", which is pronounced differently from the ending of "suggereerde".	+ Incursteen's last syllable
dieren, nieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "dieren" ends with "-ien", which has the sound /iːn/, whereas the word "nierin" (note: I assume you meant to type "nier-en") ends with "/ɛrə(n)". Although they share similar vowels, their final consonant sounds differ ("-en" vs. "-er"). Therefore, according to standard phonological criteria for rhyming in English (and many other languages), including the requirement
kielvlak, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "kielvlak" ends with the sound combination "-lak", which consists of the consonant /k/ and the diphthong "/aʊ/".* The word "voorig" (not "voorlig") also ends with the same sound combination, namely "-ig", which again contains the consonant /g/ and the digraph "/oi"/ that represents the diphthong "/oɪ/.Since
devieren, beneficieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "devieren" (de-vi-er-en) end with "-en", while those of "beneficieren" (be-ne-fi-ci-e-ren) also end with "-eren". Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequences, both ending patterns share the same vowels (-e-) and final nasalized consonant sound ("-n"). This meets the criteria for rhyming in many languages, including English and Dutch. Therefore,
passagieren, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "passagieren" and "pionieren" do not rhyme.Justification: In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. The word "passagieren" ends with "-ien", which is pronounced as /iən/. On the other hand, the word "pionieren" also ends with "-ien", but its pronunciation is slightly different (/ijɔniːrən/). Although they
prejudicieren, ambieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "prejudicieren" and "ambieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or share similar ending phonemes, we need to examine their final syllables carefully.The word "prejudicieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /erən/. The last part of this suffix is pronounced as /ern/.On the other hand, the word "ambiren
doodsprentjes, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "doods" and "invul" can be considered to rhyme.Justification:* The word "doods" ends with the sound /s/* The word "invul" also ends with the same sound /l/Although they don't share exact letters in their final part (one has's' while other has 'l'), when pronounced, both end with similar phonetic values (/z/) which is what defines rhyming in many languages including
purifierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "purifierend" and "differentierend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending parts carefully. Rhyming requires that both words share similar phonetic patterns at the end of each word. This means they should have the same combination of vowels and consonants following them.The words "purifieren" and "differenteren"
composteerden, katalyseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The suffix "-eren" appears at the end of both "composteereden" and "katalysereeden", which indicates that they share similar ending patterns.* When examining each word individually, we can see:	+ In "composteereden", the last two syllables ("-teerde") contain the vowels "ee".	+ In "katalysereede(n)", the last three syllables ("-lysee
ontdekken, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontdekken" and "aanvijlen" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "ontdekken" ends with "-ek"- sound (different consonants) while the word "aanvijlen" has a double letter combination of "-ij-" which is considered as one consonantal unit in Dutch phonology, so they don't meet the criteria for rhyming. Additionally, even if we consider only vowels ("en" vs. "ien
gradeerden, skeletteerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "gradeeren" has the ending "-deeren", which means that the last two letters (-ee) form a diphthong.* In this case, when comparing with the second word "skeleteeren", we can see that both end in -eereen (or more specifically -eer-). This satisfies the condition of having similar or same vowels after the initial difference between their meanings and grammatical functions within sentences where
heertjes, schorseneertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "heertjes" and "schorseneertjes" do indeed rhyme.The justification is as follows:* Both words end with "-tjes", which indicates that they share similar phonetic characteristics.	+ The vowels in both cases are pronounced similarly (both being reduced to schwa-like sounds).	+ The final consonantal sound /s/, although distinct from each other (/r/ vs./n/) still maintain the same syllable-final position after the
portieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the provided Dutch words "portieren" and "schapuleren", we can observe that they do not perfectly match in terms of rhyming criteria, which requires having different initial consonants but sharing similar final vowels and ending with matching consonantal sounds (if any). The word "portieren" ends with "-eren" while "schapulieren" terminates as "-ulen". Although both end with -n or -l sound combinations, their overall phon
zetterijen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "zetterijen" ends with the sound "-terijen", which has the same vowels ("i") but distinct consonants ("-t-" vs no other consonants).* Similarly, the word "vooralig" also ends with the sound "-ilig", having the same vowel ("i") but distinct consonants ("-l-", "-"g").According to this definition of rhyming in Dutch (different consonants followed by identical vowel
kielvlak, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kielvlak" ends with the sound /læk/, which has the same vowel (/ɑ/) and consonant(/k, l/) as the suffix "-ontroemt", which also has the same ending "/məkt/. Since they share similar phonetic patterns (different consonants preceding identical vowels/consonants), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to standard criteria for rhyming in languages like English or Germanic ones
planimetreer, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "planimetreer" ends with the sound /reɪr/* "vergokte" ends with the sound /tə/Although they don't share exactly same ending, we can compare their last three letters: "-ire", "-kte". The vowels in both cases ("i" and "e") may not seem identical at first glance, but when pronounced together form similar diphthongs (in this case, approximately [
joysticks, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "joystick" has the ending sound /ks/, while the word "duivelsklauw" (Dutch for 'devil's claw') ends with the combination of letters "-uw". Although they differ in their initial consonantal parts, both endings contain the same vowel-consonant pair (-i-ck) which is one way to define rhyming in English poetry. In this case, we can consider them as having similar phonetic patterns at
jut, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "jut" ends with the sound /t/.* The word "hartzwakte" (which means 'heart attack' in English) also ends with the same sequence of sounds: //, which can be broken down into:	+ Consonant(s): w	+ Identical Vowel Sound: a	+ Identical Consonant Sounds: kteSince both words end with distinct consonantal sequences (/
onneembaarder, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "onneem" ends with the sound "-eem"2. "b-a-r-d-e-r" has no identical vowels or consonants to match3. The word that comes after, "indeu-k", starts with a new sequence of phonemes (vowels/consonants) so there's nothing to compare for rhyming purposes.4. In general, in Dutch language, perfect rhymes require not only matching final
verlegd, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "verlegd" ends with the sound "-ed", which is pronounced as /t͡sɛpt/. The word "esthetic-a" (note: I assume you meant to type "aesthética") has two parts, ending in "-tic-" (/ˈæstʰetik/) and then "-a". When considering only the last part of each word ("-ed"/"-ic-", respectively), they do not share any similar
zenuwpijn, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zenuw" ends with the sound /pɪn/* "statica" ends with the sound /ˈstætɪkə/Although they differ in their initial consonantal sounds, both end with the same vowels (/i/) and final consonants (/n/, /c/). In phonetics, this pattern of having different initials but matching finals (identical V-Consonant patterns) defines rhyming
embarkeerde, retireerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "embarkeerde" and "retireerden" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their phonetic structure. The word "embarkeerde" ends with "-ede", which has the sound /de/. On the other hand, the word "retireerden" also ends with "-eden", but this time having the distinct sounds of /eɪnərð
spieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "spieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which consists of the vowels "i" and the consonant(s) "r".* Similarly, the word "saffieren" also ends with the same sequence: "-iren".Since they both end with the exact same combination of vowels ("i") and consonants("r"), we can conclude that their rhyming criterion (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds
joysticks, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "joystick" ends with the sound /ɪks/* "-ingestort-" (from ingestorte) ends with the same sound, specifically /t/Since they both end with different consonants (/k/s vs./t/) but share similar following vowel/consonant sounds (-i/k-/-e/t), yes, according to your definition of rhyming in Dutch, these two words do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
recreeerden, macadamiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "recreeerden" and "macadamiseerde" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyme or not, we need to check whether they end with the same sound pattern of vowels (V) and consecutive consonants (C). In other words, we look for V-C patterns that match exactly between both words.The word "recreeerden" ends with "-eden", which is pronounced as /ˈ
mythologiseerde, convoceerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "mythologiseerde" and "convoceerden" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their final syllables. The last part of each word is "-ereed" in both cases (ending with -e-e-rd). According to standard phonological rules for rhyming in languages like English and Germanic ones, including Dutch, when comparing two words that end with similar
pruimenboomgaarden, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pruimen" and "invullen" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "pruimen" ends with the sound /mɛn/ (pronounced as "men"), which is a distinct combination of vowels and consonants.On the other hand, the word "invullen" ends with the sound /vʏlən/ (pronounced as "ool-en"). Although both words share similar-sounding endings (/en/, in
europeaniserend, regulerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "European" ends with the sound /erən/.2. "-iserend" in Europeaniserend also has the same ending, which is /izɛrɑnt/, but pronounced slightly differently due to its position within the word.3. However, when focusing on the last two letters (-nd), they both represent distinct phonemes (/d/) that do not change their pronunciation despite being part of separate syllables.4.
ontruimt, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "ontruimt" and "-ingesteld-" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* They both end with the suffixes "-mt" (in "ontruimt") and ""-stld-" or simply "-"dt-" depending how you break down "-gesteld-", which share similar phonetic characteristics.	+ The vowels (-u-) match	+ The following consonantal sounds (/m/, /d/) differ, but their place
discussieren, humilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "discusseren" and "humilieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of final syllables with similar vowels (monophthongs) and following consonantal sequences (consonance).1. The word "discusseren" ends with "-ren", which is pronounced as /rɛn/.2. On the
deeltijdbanen, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "deeltijdbanen" and "treknet" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check whether they share the same ending sound despite having different initial letters or syllables. The rhyming criterion is that both words should end with the exact same sequence of vowels (V) and consonants (C).The word "deeltijdbanen" ends with "-n", which consists
versmallen, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "versmallen" and "ontrookt" (not "ontroomt", I assume that's a typo) do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with "-ten"	+ In "versmallen", the last syllable is pronounced as /ˈvɛrsmaːlən/, where the final -len has a distinct sound.	+ Similarly in "ontrookt", the last syllable
schmierden, begierden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "schmierden" ends with the sound "-er-den", which has the same vowel ("e") and consonant ("-r-").* Similarly, the word "begierden" also ends with the sound "-ei-reden", again having the same vowel ("i-e-i") and consonant ("-d-en").In both cases, there are no changes in the preceding or following letters that would alter their pronunciation when combined (the
prejudicieren, humilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "prejudiceren" and "humiliren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. The word "prejudiceren" ends with "-eren", which contains the diphthong combination of /er/. On the other hand, the word "humiliren" ends with "-iren". Although both endings contain similar letters (-ire), they differ in terms of phonetic
kwintalen, duif, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "kwinta" (first part of the word) ends with "-nta", which has the same vowel sound as "dui-" in "duif". The difference lies in their final consonantal sounds, where "kwinta" ends with /t/ while "duf" ends with /f/. This meets the criteria for rhyming according to traditional phonetic rules. In linguistics, this type of similarity between two words' ending syllables or
etnisch, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "etnisch" and "ontruimt" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending patterns of vowels and following consonants. Rhyming occurs when both words end with distinct letters but share similar phonetic values for those closing segments.The word "etnisch" ends with "-sch", which has a unique combination of consonantal sound /
zouterijen, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:In the pair of Dutch words "zouterijen" and "vuilpersleiding", we can analyze their rhyming characteristics as follows:* Both words end with "-ingen"	+ In "zouterijen", the final syllable has the sound combination "/-ijn/" (the diphthong /ui/)	+ In "vuilpersleiding", the final syllable also ends in "/-ijn/", but this time, it
oudeheren, debuteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "oude" ends with the sound /erən/, which consists of the letter combination "-ude".* The word "herten" also ends with this same sound, /-erde/.* Although they don't share exact letters in their ending sequences (i.e., not all vowels or consonants match), both end with similar phonetic values (/rɛrn/) due to the presence of the diphthong "eu
dienstroosters, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The reason is that the suffix "-st" in "dienstoosters" has the same sound as the prefix "es-" in "esthetiek". In both cases, we find the sequence of a voiceless alveolar fricative /s/, then the voiced dental nasal /tʰ/. This meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different initial consonants but following them with similar vowels (here, /oː/) and ending with similar
invallen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "invallen" ends with the sound /nəlɛn/	+ The final consonant sequence is "-ln"	+ The last two letters ("en") form a diphthong, which can be considered equivalent to a single vowel-consonant combination* "statica" ends with the sound /stætɪkɑː/	+ The final consonant sequence is "-tk-"
boerenfluitjes, spuitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "boeren" ends with the sound "-en", which has the same vowel ("e") and following consonant ("n").* "spuit"-based suffixes (like spuitjes) also end with the sound "-it", where again, there's the same vowel ("i") and following consonant ("t").Since both endings share similar patterns of matching vowels and consonants, they can technically be considered rhyming in the context you
wegdruip, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "wegdruip" ends with the sound /pɪpt/.* The word "voorraadtechnieke" (I assume you meant to write this instead of "voorraadlttte", which doesn't exist in Dutch) ends with the same sequence: /t/.In both cases, there's no difference between the final vowels or consonants, so they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming according to
chocolaatjes, h'tjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "chocolaatjes" ends with the sound /ɛtʃəs/, which has the same vowel (/e/) and ending consonant cluster (/"ts"/) as* "'h-tjes", which also ends with the sound /'hts/. Since they share the same final syllable's vowel phoneme and similar consonantal endings, we can conclude that these two words do indeed rhyme in Dutch according to their rhym
piepjongst, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the provided Dutch words "piep", "jongst", "duivel" and "klauw" do indeed rhyme.Here's why:1. The first part of each word ("pie-", "-jongs-', "-dui-" and "-klu-") ends with distinct consonantal sounds.2. Each subsequent syllable starts with a unique set of vowels (-ie-, -ing-st-, -e-v-e-l-s-klau-wen).3. When comparing the
incrusteerden, embarkeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "incrusteerden" and "embarkeerde" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share similar syllable patterns with distinct consonantal sound combinations ending in vowels (V) or diphthongs (/), accompanied by matching final consonantal clusters (C). In this case:* Both words end with -de, where V is pronounced as /ɛːr/.* The preceding consonant sequences
nadook, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "nadook" ends with "-ooc", which has distinct consonantal sound /k/. The suffix "-ingesteld-" also follows this pattern, ending in -ed (with no additional consonental sounds). In rhyming, we consider similar phonetic patterns between two or more syllables at their end to determine if they match. Here:- Both pairs of letters ("ooC") share identical vowels (/o/) but not consonants (-different
diere, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "diere" ends with the sound /ire/, which has the same vowels (/i/) and final consonants (both pronounced as /r/) compared to the ending "-pluvieren". The difference lies in their initial consonants, where "diere" starts with "/d/" while "pluvieren" begins with "/p/", satisfying the criteria for rhyming according to traditional phonological analysis of Dutch language.<|eot_id|>
nadook, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffix "-ook" in "nadook" has the same sound as the suffixes "-et-" or "-tica" in "esthetica". The final consonantal sound /k/ matches, and so do the preceding vowels ("o" vs. "e"). Therefore, according to the criteria of rhyming (different consonants preceded by similar/same vowel and following consonant sounds), we can conclude that "nadook" and "esthetica
polariserend, toucherend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "polariserend" and "toucherend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two Dutch words to rhyme, they need to end with the same sequence of vowels (including diphthongs) and consecutive consonantal phonemes (/m/, /n/, etc.). In this case,* The last syllable in "polariserend" is "-rend", which ends with the sound combination "/rɛnt/".* The last
taswoning, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "taswonning" and "radende" meet the criteria for rhyming in that they both end with distinct consonantal sounds, specifically /ŋg/ (the ng sound) and /nd/, respectively, which is immediately preceded by the same vowel sound (/ɑː/) or approximately so when considering phonetic transcriptions of spoken language. This meets one common definition of rhymin' where final syllables share similar but not necessarily exact matching sequences
associeren, expedieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "associeren" ends with the sound "-eren", which consists of the vowels "e" and "r".2. "expedieren" also ends with the same pattern, specifically "-diren", consisting again of the vowels "i" and "n".Since both end in similar patterns (-ere- vs -dire-) where each has distinct consonants (R & D) preceding identical vocalic ("e") and consonantal ("
handelwijs, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "handelwijs" and "ontroomt" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In Dutch phonology, rhyming is determined by whether two or more syllables end with similar sound combinations, known as diphthongs (Dutch: rime). In this case:* Both words ("handelwijs" and "ontroomt") share the same ending pattern of "-nt".	+ The word "handelwijs" ends in
amplificeren, concilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "amplificeren" and "concilieren" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "amplificeren" ends with "-ren", which has a distinct sound of /rɛn/.* On the other hand, the word "concilieren" ends with "-liren", having a unique combination of /liːrən/.Since they don't share similar consonantal sequences or ending vowels/consonants (e
joysticks, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "joystick" (Dutch pronunciation is /ˈjɔy.stik/) and "tachismes" (/tə'kiz.məs/, note the plural form) meet the criteria for rhyming in that they both end with distinct consonantal sounds, specifically "/tik/" and "/mz/", respectively, which follow similar vowel sounds ("i" and "e"). This satisfies the definition of perfect rhyme or exact rhyme found
Jut, kelderdeur, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "jut" ends with the sound /t/.* The second word "kelder-" has no ending, but if we consider its last part "-der", which comes from adding -er to keld-, then it also ends in /r/, not /d/. So they do differ.* The third word "deur" ends with the diphthong "/uːə/" (approximately like 'oo-uh
refreintjes, harlekijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "refreintjes" ends with the sound /tʃɛz/	+ The final consonant cluster is "-ntj"	+ The last two letters, "ez", form a diphthong* "harlekijntjes" also ends with the same sound /tʃɛz/	+ Similarly, its final consonant cluster is "-lktj"Since both words end in the sequence
introduceetjes, reetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "introduce" ends with the sound /tʃɛz/, which has a distinct set of consonantal phonemes (/t/, /ʃ/) preceding a specific combination of vowels and final consonents (-ez).* "-jet-" in "jeaties" (assuming you meant to type that instead of "reetjes") also forms a separate syllable, ending with -jəts.Since they don't share similar sets of
tensie, uitrokend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-sie" in "tensie-" matches with the ending "-ende" in "uitrokend", as they both end with the same sequence of vowels (-i-) and consonants (e, d). This meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language where two words can be considered to rhyme if their final syllables consist of the same combination of vowel(s) plus one or more consonant(s), regardless of any preceding phonemes. In
detacheer, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "indeuk" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables for similar patterns of vowels (V) and consonants (C). Rhyming requires that both words end with distinct C-V-C combinations. The word "detacheer" ends in "-eer", which consists of V-C ("ee-r"). On the other hand, "indeuk"
Papoetjes, doetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "Papoetjes" and "doetjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is determined when two or more words share similar phonetic patterns in their final syllables. In this case,* The word "Papoetjes" ends with the sound /ijes/, which consists of:	+ Different consonant(s): /p/	+ Identical vowels: /e/i	+ Consonant cluster
loopgravenstelling, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "loop", "grav" in "loopgravenstelling" all end with the sound /oːp/, which is consistent throughout this part of the word. Similarly, the suffix "-teling" also ends with the same sound pattern "/iəl/" as seen in other English/Dutch loanwords like "beelding". On top of that, both "kiel-" and "vlak" share similar ending patterns where they respectively contain the
janplezieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "jan" ends with the sound "-an".* The suffixes "-pl-" in both "plezieren" and "schapuleren" form distinct pairs of consonants.* Both "ier-"/"ulen"- follow identical vowels ("i") and end with similar but not exactly same consonantal endings ("-r" vs.-"n").Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that "janplezielen" and
amplificeren, rationaliseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "amplificeren" and "rationaliseren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending parts (the last syllables). In both cases:* The first word ("amplificeren") ends with "-iren", which contains the letters "i" as vowels.* The second word ("rationaliseren") also ends with "-iren".However, even though they share
diskwalificerend, objectiverend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "diskwalificeren" (to disqualify) and "objectiveren" (to objectivize) do indeed share the same ending sound "-endernd", which is composed of:* Identical vowels: both end with the letters "-e"* Consonant cluster: in each word, there's a sequence of three consonantal letters ("-nder")This meets the criteria for rhyming in many languages, including Dutch. The final syll
kielvlakken, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "kiel" has the sound /iːl/* The suffix "-vlak-" also ends with the same sound /ɑlk/, which includes both vowels (/a/) and consonants (/\(l\)/)* Similarly, in the second part of the compound noun "voorig", we find:	+ "vor" having the sound /oʊr/	+ The ending "-ig" again featuring
anjelieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "anjelieren" ends with the sound /iren/	+ The last three letters ("ren") form a distinct unit, which represents a single phoneme (sound) in this context.	+ This means that we can analyze them together for rhyming purposes: /ɪrən/.* "saffieren", on the other hand, also ends with the same sequence of sounds (/iren/) although they represent slightly different phonemes
manieren, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "manieren" and "vlieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check their ending sounds. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching final syllables with differing consonantal sounds but sharing similar or identical vowels (and sometimes even consonants).The word "manieren" ends with "-eren", which contains the diphthong combination of /eɪr/. On the other hand,
contravenierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "contraveneren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the vowels "e-r".* "distanteren" also ends with the sound "-eren", which again has the same vowels "e-r".Since both words end with the exact same sequence of consonents ("r") and vowels ("er"), they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, specifically having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonent
wegdruip, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "wegdruip", ends with the sound /pɪʏ̯p/.* The second word, "omsingel", also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /l/.Although they may not look like perfect rhymes at first glance due to their non-native English spellings, both words indeed share the same ending sound pattern (different consonants + identical vowels). This meets the criteria for having
pardoentjes, seizoentjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the pair of words "pardoentjes" and "seizoentjes", we can identify that they share similar ending patterns:* "-oentje-" in both cases	+ The vowels (-e-) remain unchanged, which is one condition for rhyming.	+ Although there's no exact match between the preceding consonants (P-D vs S-Z), their positions within each word follow the same pattern ("-d-" and "-z-", respectively
uitrokend, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two phrases "uitrokend" and "voorigh" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they both end with "-nd", which counts as identical consonant sounds, following respectively the vowels "u" and "o". This meets the definition of perfect rhymes (also known as exact or phonetic matches) in the language. The similarity between their ending sounds makes them rhyme according to standard linguistic conventions regarding syllable division and
concilieren, resisteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "concilieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which has the vowels "i" and "e".* The word "resisteren" also ends with the same combination of vowels, namely "i" and "eren".Since both words end with the same sequence of letters (the consonants "r" and the repeated vowel-consonent pair "ie"), they technically do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English
kielvlak, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "verlegd" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (or moras). Rhyming in Dutch typically occurs when both words end with different consonantal clusters but share the same vowel sound(s) or diphthongs immediately preceding those clusters [1].The word "kielvlak" ends with "-lak", which has distinct conson
glanduleuze, volumineuze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "glanduleuze" ends with the sound "-ueze".* The second word "volumineuze" also ends with the same sound "-ueze".Since they both end with the exact same combination of vowels (-u-) and consonants (-e-), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition provided (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
tierelierend, tierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "tierelierend" ends with the sound /nd/* "-ier-" has the same vowel and preceding consonant ("i", "/r/")* The word "tierend" also ends with the sound /nd/Since they both end in the same way, but not exactly alike (different prefixes), according to the rules of rhyming for Dutch language, which require that two words should share similar ending phonemes including vowels and following consonants
handelwijs, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "handelwijzen" (not "handlewis", I assume that's a typo) and "detachéer" do not rhyme.Here is why:* The last syllable of both words has different vowels: "-ijz-" in "handelwijsen" versus "-ée-" in "detachéer".	+ In "handelwijzen", there is no final consonantal sound after the vowels.	+ On the other side, in
multiplierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "multiplieren" and "asfyxieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. The last part of each word is "-eren" in both cases ("-lieren" would also work). However, before this suffix lies distinct sequences of letters: "ulti-p-li-" (in "multiplieren") versus "a-s-f-yxi-" (in "as
avondfeesten, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "avondfeesten" and "voorighig" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "avondfeesten" ends with "-sten", which has distinct consonantal sound /t/, while the word "voorighig" (note: there is no such word as "voorighig". I assume you meant to write "voorlijk") ends with "-lijg", having distinct consonantal sound /l/. The final vowels
binnenstormde, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "binnenstormde" and "Esthetika" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "binnenstormde" ends with the sound /ɛrmdə/, which has distinct vowels (e) and consonants (/r/) that differ from those in the suffix "-et-i-ca" of the second word ("Estheti(ca)") ending with the sound /a/. In order for them to rhyme, they would need to share similar or identical
voorlichtte, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "voor" has the sound combination /vur/* "licht-" also has this same sound combination, namely /litʃtə/* "-tte" in both cases serves to indicate that they end with a diminutive suffix* The final part of each word differs:	+ In "voort-duiken", we find "/dɪk/"	+ In "voor-ligte-", there's no corresponding segment because
kruisbessestruiken, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kruis" ends with the sound /sɪz/	+ The final syllable "-ise" has different consonants (/s/) and the same vowel sound (i) compared to other options.* "bessen-" ends with the sound /ˈbeʃən̩/    + This ending does not match any of the subsequent word parts, so we can ignore this for rhyming purposes* "
bekwaamden, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "bekwaamden" ends with the sound "-en"	+ The last two letters (-en) make up one phonetic unit, where both vowels ("e") share similar pronunciation	+ There's no change in consonantal sounds between them (both are nasalized)* "vuilpersleiding" also ends with the same pattern: -ing     + Again, there's only one phonetic unit here; the final syll
tensie, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "tensie" and "ordeinde" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they end with different consonants but share similar final vowels (in this case "-e") and preceding consonantal sounds ("ns-" vs. no distinctive sound). This similarity in phonological structure makes them rhymable according to standard linguistic definitions of perfect rhyme or near-rhyme.<|eot_id|>
etnisch, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "etnisch" ends with the sound "-tɪʃ"2. "verluchtten" ends with the sound "-ltənt"Although they don't share exactly similar ending letters, both end in distinct combinations of vowels and consonants that can still produce rhyming effects when pronounced correctly. The similarity lies not only in their phonetic representation but also in how speakers would naturally pronounce them to achieve this effect. In
jut, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jut" and "zouterijen" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "jut" ends with the sound /t/, whereas "zouterijen" ends with the digraph /jn/. Since they don't share similar ending patterns (different consonants), we can conclude that they do not technically rhyme in Dutch phonology rules. Rhyming typically requires matching final syllable sounds or diphthongs, which is not present
omsingel, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The two words "omsingel" and "esthetica" end with the same vowels, which are "-el" in both cases.2. However, they differ significantly in their final consonantal sound: "sngl-" (in "omsingel") vs. "-tica" (in "esthetica").3. According to phonological rules of rhyming, if the last syllable or word ends with distinct conson
respireerde, intensiveerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "respireerde" ends with the sound /de/.2. It has no consonants following this ending, only the letter 'e', which doesn't change its pronunciation.3. Similarly, the word "intensiveerden" also ends in "/en/", where '/n/' does not affect the preceding vowels' pronunciations (in general, English-speaking people pronounce them separately).4. Since both endings consist of identical vowel
schapulieren, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schapulieren" and "pionieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their phonetic composition. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of final syllables with distinct vowels (not necessarily equal) but similar consecutive consonantal sounds or no consonants at all ("silent e").Here's how you can analyze the provided pair:1. The last part of both words is "-ier
regulerend, remarquerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "regulerend" (regularly) and "remarquerend" (remarkable) do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they share similar ending sounds /rɛnd/. Although their initial consonantal clusters differ (/rgʊləˈrɑnt/ vs. /rmɑrkjəˈrɛnt/), this does not preclude them from being considered rhymes according
voorlieg, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "voor" ends with the sound /lɛk/* "lieg" also ends with the same sound /lɛk/* "vers" ends with the sound /sərz/* "voeten" ends with the sound /vutn/Since they do not share the same ending consonant-sound combination, we can conclude that the two pairs of words ("voorlieg"-"versvoeten")
tierend, zwierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "tier" ends with the sound /nd/* "zwie-" also ends with the same sound, which can be broken down into two parts: "-wi-", where "-"i-" has no effect on the ending (since there's another letter following), so we're left with just "/v/"So both end in similar-sounding vowels ("-e" and "'") followed by distinct consonantal endings ("/d/" vs "./"). This satisfies the
kielvlak, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "kielvlak" ends with the sound /lak/, which consists of the vowels "/a/" (short) and the consonant cluster "/lk/.* The word "ordenen" ends with the sound /den/, which also consists of the vowels "/e/", again short, and another consonant cluster "/nd/.Since they both end in distinct consonantal clusters (/lk/ vs./ nd/) following similar but not identical vowel combinations
tuinierend, verzwierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "tuinierend" ends with the sound /nd/* The second word "verzwijerend" also ends with the same sound /nd/However, since they do not share any other similar letters or syllables preceding this ending sequence of /n-d/, we can conclude that despite sharing the final phoneme (/nd/) which might initially suggest rhyming, their overall pronunciation differs due to distinct initial sequences (e
duivelsklauwen, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last syllables of both "duivelsklauwen" (klu-wen) and "sciopticons" (kon-s) end with distinct consonant clusters, but they also share similar vowel sound patterns (-u- in "klu-" vs -o- or -i- in "-con-", which can still produce a rhyming effect). This meets the criteria for Dutch word-rhyme: having dissimilar initial consonants yet
gereciproceerde, perforeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "gerecircupeerede" (reciprocated) and "perforeerden" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "gerecircupeerede" ends with "-ede", which has the diphthong sound /ɛr/.* On the other hand, the word "perforeerden" ends with "-eren", which has the same ending as many regular -eer endings in Dutch.* Although both end-ings
plevieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plevieren" and "schapuleren" do not rhyme.Justification: In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (the part after the last vowel). The word "plevieren" ends with "-eren", while "schapuleren" ends with "-ulen". Although they both contain vowels (-e-), they differ in their subsequent consonantal sound patterns ("ren" vs. "ln").
spalieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "spalieren" ends with the sound /niren/, which consists of the consonant /r/ and the diphthong /ie/. On the other hand, "brevieren" also ends with the same sequence: /viren/. The final vowels (/i/) match in both cases, but more importantly, so do their preceding consonantal sounds (/r/ vs. /v/). In rhyming terms, this means they share similar
etnisch, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "etnisch" ends with the sound /ɪʃ/* "bedrijving" ends with the sound /əŋ/Since they do not share any common vowels or consonant combinations, except for possibly some silent letters (e.g., in English), we can conclude that the two words indeed meet the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds to qualify them as rhyming.<|eot_id|>
computeriseer, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "computeriser" and "voorraadig" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending parts carefully. The word "computeriser" ends with "-eer", which is pronounced as /ɛr/. On the other hand, the word "voorraadig" ends with "-dig", which is also pronounced differently (/dɪx/) compared to "/ɛr".As
resisterend, beconcurrerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "resisteren" ends with the sound /nd/.* The word "beconcurreneren" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely /r/, /n/, and then again /d/.As both words end with the same combination of vowels (the diphthong "eeren") and final consonants (/nd/) they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different initial consonants
handicaprace, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "handicap" ends with the sound /kæp/.2. The second word "racing" (not present in your list, but assumed) would end with the sound /ɪŋstərt/. Although not provided directly, we can assume this based on common English pronunciation.3. The third word "ingestort" has its last syllable ending with the same phonemes: /t/.According
pionieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "pionieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the vowels "e" and the following consonant combination "-ren".* The word "bestieren" also ends with the same sound, namely "-eren". This means that both words share the same final syllable structure: -V-C (identical vowel-consonant pair).According to this criterion of rhyming in Dutch, where two words end with distinct conson
rapieren, anjelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rapieren" and "anjelieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming (also known as having similar ending syllables), we need to examine their final vowels and following consonant(s). If they share the same combination of vowel sound and subsequent consonant or consonants, then they can be considered rhyming words.The word "rapieren" ends with "-iren", which consists of the d
kielvlak, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kiel" in "kielvlak" ends with the sound /l/* "-erende" in "kerkerende" also ends with the same suffix "/r Ende/"	+ The vowels of both endings ("i" and "e") do not match, but that's okay	+ What matters for rhyming is whether they share the same ending consonants (in this case, -RND)Since both end
tensie, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending of "tensie" (-sie) has the same vowels (i/e/i) as well as similar but not exactly matching final consonantal sound (/s/) compared to "-neger-" in "negerwijk". The rhyming criterion you mentioned, which requires differing consonants preceded by equal vowel/consonant combinations holds true for this pair of words. Therefore, they do indeed rhyme according to your definition.<|eot_id|>
contravenierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "contravenerend" and "asphyxiërend" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "contravenerend" ends with "-endernd", which has the sound /nɛrnt/.* The word "asphyxiërend" ends with "-yksiərent", which also has its own distinct sequence of sounds.* Since they don't share similar sequences or patterns in their ending sounds (different vowels and/or conson
jatten, tensie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the words "jatten" and "tensie", we can see that they both end with the same sound "-en". This is known as perfect rhyming, which in this case means having similar or identical final syllables (in this case, -ten). The preceding consonants differ ("jj-" vs. simple "ts-"), but since the ending vowels (-e) match exactly, yes, indeed, these two Dutch words do technically rhyme according to
gecollecteerde, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "gecollecteerde" has the sound "-erteer-" in its ending.* The second word "getasseerd" also ends with the same sound "-erteer-".* Although they share similar suffixes, their prefixes ("gecoll"- vs. "getra") differ significantly enough to indicate that they do not perfectly match for rhyming purposes according to traditional phonological rules of Dutch language (which emphasize differences between initial
piepjongst, vrijheidsklasse, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "piepjongs" has the sound combination "-ij-" in its suffix.* The word "vrijheidsklasse" also ends with the same sound combination "-iejs".* Although they do not share exact letters, their ending vowels ("i") and following consonantal sounds ("-j"s) match exactly, making them rhyming according to standard linguistic criteria for rhyminess (e.g., [1]).In
voorlegt, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* Voorleg-: The last three letters "t", "e" and "g" form the ending "-teg".* On-neemb-aar-d-e-r: The last four letters "r", "d", "e" and "r" form the ending "-der".In both cases, we can see that there's no repetition of identical vowels or consonants at the end, which means they don't technically rhyme according to traditional rhym
palperen, oudeheren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "palperen" and "oude heren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming language rules require that they share the same ending sound (consonant + vowel). The word "palperen" ends with "-eren", which is pronounced as /ərɛn/. On the other hand, "oude heren" has no exact end-sound because of its compound structure ("h
irreguliere, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "irregulièr" ends with the sound "-ière"* "begiëren" also ends with the same sound, which means they share similar ending patterns.However, when we examine their final letters:	+ "irregulièr" has -ère	+ "begiëren" has -erenAlthough both end in vowels ("-e"), the following consonantal sounds differ: '-re' vs.'
narcotiseren, flocculeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "narcotiseren" and "flocculeren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending parts that contain vowels and one or more consecutive consonants (known as diphthongs). The rhyming criteria is based on whether both words share similar sequences of vowel-consonant pairs at the end, excluding silent letters.The word "
resisteren, flocculeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "resisteren" and "flocculeren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching final syllables with differing initial consonantal sounds but sharing similar vocalic endings (i.e., same vowels).The word "resisteren" ends with "-eren", which has the diphthong /er/. On the other hand,
schreeuweriger, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "schreeuweriger" ends with the sound "-ier"* The word "voorraadig" (not "vorlig", which seems to be misspelled) ends with the sound "-dig"According to the rules of rhyming in Dutch, two words can be considered to rhyme if they end with different consonants but share the same vowels that precede those consonants. In this case, both words meet this
wegdropen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdroppen" and "estheticheik" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check whether they share similar phonological patterns at their final syllables. The criteria for rhyming in Dutch is that both words should end with distinct vowels (A/E/I/O/U) accompanied by unique consonantal sequences or single letters after those vowels. "Wegdorp-en" ends with -pen which
sortietjes, bougietjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "sortijes" and "bougetjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-tjes", which is a common suffix in Dutch that indicates diminutive or small-sized nouns.* The vowels preceding this suffix ("o" and "ou") share similar phonetic characteristics (both /uː/) before changing to distinct consonantal sounds (/r/, /bɛlʃe/).	+ In both cases, we
voorlig, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* Voorlig: The word ends with the sound /ɪg/* Invallen: The word also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely /ələn/Since both words end with the same combination of vowels (/ə/) and consonants (/, l, n/), they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language. In this case, "voorlig" and "invallen" can be considered to
jatten, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatten" and "voorgelegenheid" (not exactly "voorlieg", which is not a valid word in Dutch) do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with "-ten"	+ In "jatten", the final syllable has the sound /tɛn/	+ In "voorgelegenhied", the last two syllables ("gele-gen") form a diphthong /əˈ
toucherend, stationerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "toucheren" (to caress) ends with the sound "-rend", which has the same consonantal sound /nd/.* The word "stationeren" (to stationize or to make stationary) also ends with the sound "-rend".* Since both ending sounds share the same vowels (-e- and -i-) but differ in their final consonental sounds (/t/ vs. /n/) they meet the criteria for rhyming,
passagieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "passagieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the letters R, E, N.* The word "scharnieren" also ends with the sound "-iren", which has the letter I instead of N in comparison to -ern".Although they share similar endings (-iren vs. -eren), there's still a difference between them (the presence or absence of N). Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhym
piepjongst, bagatellen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "piepjongst" and "bagatelen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their phonetic composition. The last syllables of both words should match in terms of vowels (identical) and following consonants for them to be considered rhyming:* "Piep-jong-st" ends with "-t", which is a voiceless alveolar stop.* "Ba
beschietend, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "beschietend" ends with the sound "-nd", which consists of two distinct consonants.* The word "ontduik" also has its own unique ending, specifically "-k".According to the definition provided earlier (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that indeed both words ("beschietend" and "ontduik") do not share similar endings in terms of their final conson
kruisbessestruik, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last three syllables of each word ("-esse-", "-swoni", and "-tui") follow this pattern: they end with similar but not exactly same sound, which meets the criteria for rhyming in many languages including English (and likely also Dutch). Specifically:* "kruis-" has no effect on the final consonantal sound* "-bes-" ends with /s/* "-set" ends with /st/* "-tru-"
avondfeesten, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "avondfeesten" ends with the sound "-sten".* The word "voorgelt" (which I assume you meant to type instead of "voorlegt") also has two syllables: "voo-gelt". It can be broken down into its individual parts:	+ "voo-" which contains the same vowel sound ("o")	+ "-gelt" which contains the same ending (-lt) as in
planimetreer, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "planimètre" (not exactly the same spelling, but close enough) has the ending "-ère", which indicates that its final syllable ends with the sound /ɛʁ/.* The word "kerkeren-de" also ends in "/ɛʁ/".* Since both endings share the same vowel-consonant combination (/e+r/) at their end, they can be considered to rhyme according to the rules of
nieren, mortieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "nieren" and "mortieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is typically defined as having similar or identical final syllable sounds in two or more words. In this case,* The word "nieren" ends with the sound /en/, which consists of the vowels "i" (a single-vowel combination) + the nasal consonant "n".* Similarly, the word "mortieren" also ends with
essaaierend, discussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two Dutch words "essaaierend" (explaining) and "discussierend" (discussing) do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they share similar final syllables with differing initial consonantal sounds but ending with the same vowels and subsequent consonental sounds ("-nd"). The "-erend"-ending of both words indicates this shared sound pattern. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these Dutch words rhyme according
recreeerden, specialiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "recreeerden" and "specialiseerden" do rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is defined as having similar or identical final syllables with differing initial parts of speech (consonance). In this case, both words end in "-eerden", which meets one condition for rhyming: they share the same ending vowels ("-eren") and following consonantal sound ("-d").Additionally, their prefixes differ significantly enough to
trasseerden, hybridiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "trasseerden" and "hybridiseerden" both end with the suffix "-eerden", which indicates that they share similar sound patterns at their ends. The last three letters of each word, namely "-r-s-e-r-d-n", follow this pattern:* Different initial consonants: /t/ in "trasseerden" vs. /h/ in "hybridiseerden"* Identical vowels (/e/)
scholieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "scholieren" and "scharnieren" do rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming, we need to examine their final syllables or moras (the smallest unit of sound). In this case, both "scholieren" and "scharnieren" end with "-eren". The suffixes "-en", "-er", etc., belong to what is called the verb conjugation pattern for regular verbs
indeuk, profilerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "indeuk" ends with the sound "-euk".2. The word "profileren" (not "profillerend", which doesn't exist in Dutch) also ends with the same sequence of sounds: "-eren".In this case, both words end with the suffixes "-euk" and "-eren". These suffixes contain different initial consonants ("d-" vs. "p-") but share the ending
voorlieg, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "voorlieg" ends with "-ieg", which has the sound /ɪəʝ/, while the word "bediendaars" ends with "-aars", which also has the same phonetic representation, specifically /æːrz/. Although they differ in their final consonantal sequence (-ie- vs -ar-s), both end with the diphthong-like combination of vowels (ooer) followed by similar consonantic closure
reproducenten, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "reproducenten" ends with the sound "-enten", which has the diphthong /ɛnt/.* "esthetica" ends with the sound "-tica", which also has the same vowels (/i/) and ending consonant "/k/" or similar (in this case, "/tʃa"/).Since they share the same final vowel ("e") and distinct but matching initial consonantal sequences (-r...-,
vergokte, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "vergokte" and "ontruimt" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the suffix "-te", which is a common way to form nouns in Dutch.* The last three letters of both words ("-kte") share similar phonetic properties:	+ They start with distinct consonants (/v/, /n/) that don't affect the rhyming quality (since they're not identical).	+ Followed by
jaartjes, pilaartjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two-word sequence "jaartjes" and "pilaartjes" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires having different initial consonants but sharing the same final vowels and following consonant(s). In this case:* The first word ends with "-rtj-" (different consonants)* Both end with the long "a"-sound (-a-)According to the rules of Dutch phonology, since they share similar ending
quintolen, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "quintollen" ends with the sound "-ellen", which has two L's.* The word "trompetboom" also ends with the sound "-oom".Since they both end in vowels ("e") and similar consonantal sounds (L), but not exactly the same, we can conclude that they do indeed share this characteristic of rhyming according to the rules you specified for Dutch language. In general, perfect rhymes require
resisterend, remarquerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "resisterend" and "remarquerend" meet the criteria for rhyming in that they both end with "-erend", which means their final syllables share similar phonetic characteristics:* The vowels (-e-) at the end of each word sound alike, being pronounced as /ɛ/.* The following consonantal sounds (/nd/) also match exactly.Rhyme is typically defined as having matching ending sounds (identical or very close
duif, kolendampvergiftiging, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "duif" (dove) and "kolen-damp-vergiftiging" ("carbon monoxide poisoning") meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* The final syllables of both words end with distinct consonantal sounds: /f/ and -nd- respectively.* Both sequences include vowels, which are pronounced identically (/iː/) before their respective following consonants.In summary, while they may not sound exactly alike when spoken aloud due
distantieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "distantieren" and "conveniren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending parts where they share similar vowels (identical) but distinct consonant combinations. The last syllable of each word is "-tienen" for both; however, in this case, only one has an additional letter 'n' before '-ren'. Since there's no matching sequence of unique conson
voorlig, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the two words "voor" (meaning 'before') and "aanvrijlen" (a verb meaning 'to attach' or 'to connect', with its infinitive form being "aanvlijn") meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:1. Different initial consonants: Voor starts with /f/, while aanvrijlen/aanvlijn start(s) with either /ɑːn/ or /ʌnv/.
gerendeerden, gerescribeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "gerendeerden" ends with the sound "-eren".2. The second word "gerescribeerde" also ends with the same suffix, which means they share similar ending patterns.3. Although both endings look slightly dissimilar due to their prefixes ("ge-" in one case), the core part of each word (-deen-, -scrip-) has distinct vowels (ee) that match exactly for rhyming purposes.
nieren, tierelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the provided words "nieren", "tieren" and "lieren", we can identify that they all end with "-eren". This suffix is characteristic of many Germanic languages, including Dutch. The rhyming criteria you mentioned - having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and consonant sounds - applies here:* Different consonants:	+ Niren ends in "N"	+ Tieren ends in "R"	+ Lieren ends in "
voertjes, broertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voertjes" and "broertjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-tjes", which is a common suffix in Dutch indicating small or diminutive forms of nouns.* The vowels preceding this suffix ("o-" and "oe-") differ only slightly in their pronunciation (the difference being mainly phonetic), but they share similar characteristics: both contain rounded diphthongs (/ɔʊ/) that approach each other closely
piepjongst, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongs" and "nauwduikend" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables for similar patterns of vowels (identical or alike) and consonants (different). The suffix "-jongs" in "piepjongs" has the same vowel sound ("o") as the prefix "nauwd-" in "nauwduikend", but
decentraliserend, indicerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "decentraliseren" (to decentralized) and "indiceren" (to indicate) do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending parts carefully. The last part of each word is "-erenden". In this case, although both end with similar sounding suffixes (-r-, -nd-), there's still one crucial difference: in "indicerende", you see the letter combination '-
trepaneerden, gebrutaliseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "trepaneerden" and "gebrutalisereede" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is characterized by having different consonants preceding identical vowels and ending with similar or same consonantal sounds. In this case:* Both words end with "-eeren", which indicates that they share the same final syllable sound.* Although their initial parts differ ("trep-" vs. "geb-", respectively), both ultimately
schreeuwerigere, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if the two Dutch words "schreeuwiger" and "sciopticons" rhyme, we need to analyze their phonetic structure.* The word "schreeuwiger" has three syllables: "schr-ee-uwig-" with distinct vowels (e) in each.	+ In its second part ("eer"), there is no repeated vowel or diphthong sound that would count as rhyming.	+
schavotjes, vlotjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schavotjes" and "vlotjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-jetjes", which is a common suffix in Dutch.* The vowels preceding this suffix ("a" and "o") differ from each other (different quality).* However, both vowels precede the same consonantal ending ("-tje"), indicating that they share similar phonological properties (identical sound).According to the criteria for rhyming mentioned
schuitjes, puitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schuitjes" and "puitjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In Dutch phonology, rhyming is determined by whether two or more syllables share similar ending sounds (vowel-consonant combinations). In this case,* Both words end with "-ijes", which means they both contain the same sequence of letters.* The final vowels in each word ("i") are identical, as well as their following consonantal sounds ("-j").
refreintjes, zwijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "refrein" ends with the sound "-tjen"	+ The final syllable has the same vowels ("-eien") but differing consonants ("-r-" vs.-")* "zwijn"-ends-with-the-sound("-tjens")Since they both end in similar patterns (-tjeN), where N represents distinct consonants, we can conclude that "refreintjes" and "zwijntjes" do indeed
rapieren, spalieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rapieren" and "spalieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In Dutch phonology, rhyming is determined by the presence of similar vowel-consonant combinations at the end of two or more words. In this case, both "rapieren" and "spalieren" end with the "-eren" suffix, which contains the same vowel sound (/ɛrən/) and distinct consonantal elements (-p- vs -s-, respectively
convenierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "convenierend" ends with the sound /nd/* "solfegierend" also ends with the same sound /nd/Since they both end with the same diphthong (a combination of vowels) "/nɛnt/" in this case, which includes the identical vowel and consonant sounds (/e/) and (/d/, resp.), we can conclude that these two Dutch words do indeed rhyme according to the definition provided
schapulieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "schapulieren" and "begienen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonetic structure. A rhyming pair in Dutch typically consists of two syllables that end with distinct consonantal sequences but share similar vocalic components (i.e., vowels).1. The word "schapulieren" ends with "-eren", which contains the diphthong /a�
duif, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "liefdesgevoelens" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "duif" ends with the sound /f/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.* On the other hand, the word "liefdesgevoelens" has multiple syllables (lie-f-des-ge-voo-el-en-s) that end in various ways (-s), but none of them match exactly to the final sound /
crediterend, proclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "crediterend" ends with the sound "-er-end", which has distinct vowels ("e") and final consonant ("-nd").* "proclamanderen" (not exactly equal to "proclamerend", but close enough) also ends with the same pattern, having distinct vowels ("a"-and-) and final consonant ("-r-en").In both cases, there's no exact repetition of consonants or syllables that would make
Jut, duivelsklauwen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jut" and "duivelsklauwen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonetic structure. In Dutch rhyming rules, similar-sounding vowels (including diphthongs) with same following consonantal sound(s), regardless of whether those consonants are single or doublet, count as matching for purposes of determining rhyminess. The word "j
bedrijving, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "bedrijving" and "esthetica" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they should end with similar or identical vowels (in this case, both ending with "-a") and distinct consonantal sounds preceding those vowels ("d-r-j-" vs. "e-s-t"). This characteristic of having differing initial consonant clusters but matching final syllable sounds (-ja) makes them technically rhyme-worthy in Dutch phonology.<|eot_id|>
supplieren, discussieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The last syllable of "suppliern" ends with the sound /-eren/, which consists of two parts: "-er" (the consonantal part) and "e" (the vocalic part).* Similarly, the last syllable of "discussiren" also ends with the sound /-ieren/, consisting of "-"i-" (consonantal part), "r" (another consonantal part), and finally "e" (v
plantluis, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plant" en "luis" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming or having similar sound patterns at their ends (known as alliterative ending), we need to analyze both vowels and final consonants carefully.1) The word "plantaat" has the letters 'nt' which is its last consonantal combination while on other hand,2) Word "Luijs" also terminates with's
quintolen, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word phrase "quintollen" (assuming that's the correct spelling) ends with "-nellen", which is pronounced as /ˈkʏntɔlə(n)/, having the same final syllable sound (-en). In contrast, the word "aethetique" would end in -eek (/iːtēki/) or similar pronunciation depending on regional accents. Since they don't share the exact same ending sequence of
kielvlak, antwoordend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kiel" ends with the sound /lɛk/* "-vlak-" has no effect on the final syllable, so we can ignore this part* "-antw"- ends with the same vowels (-nd) but not the exact same consonantal ending (d vs r)* "-ond" in "antwoordend" also does not match exactly to -r-Since they do not share the same consonantal endings after
spieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:In the words "spieren" (to exercise) and "vieren" (to celebrate), we can identify that they share similar ending patterns, which suggests that they might rhyme.Upon closer inspection, both words end with "-eren", where '-er' represents a suffix in many Germanic languages like English ("teacher"), Swedish ("lärare") or Danish ("lærere"). This shared pattern indicates that 'i', 'e', 'r'
loopgravenstellingen, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "loop" ends with the sound /p/* "-graven-" starts with the same consonantal sound /g/, which doesn't affect rhyming* "-stellingen" also has no effect on the final syllable's sound, since its first two letters ("st") don't contribute to the ending sound of this word.* Similarly for "kie-l-vlak", where only "/l/" matters in determining whether they share similar
piepjongst, binnenstroomden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "piepjongst" and "binnenstroomden" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires having different initial consonants (or none) but sharing similar ending vowels with subsequent consonantal sounds or no additional consonants at all.In this case:* The final syllable of both words ends with "-t", indicating they share the same sound.* Both words also end with -en-, where the second
aanvijl, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "aan" in "aanvijl" ends with the sound /n/* The vowels following them are both pronounced as long 'a' (/ɑ/)* There's no matching consonant after that, so we move on to the next part* In "blauw", there's another distinct set of letters: "b-l-w"	+ These end respectively with the sounds /b/, /l/, and /w/.
ritmeren, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the two words "ritmeren" and "indeuk", we can see that they both end with "-eren" in common, which means their last three letters (-een) share similar characteristics (consonant-vowel-consonant). This indicates that there is indeed rhyming between them, as per your request!<|eot_id|>
tierelieren, janplezieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "tierelieren" has the ending sound "-eren", which consists of two consecutive nasal vowels (-er-).* The second word "janplezieren" also ends with the same pattern, having -eziren.* Since both endings share similar patterns (different initial consonants but end in identical vowel-consonant combinations), they technically do not perfectly match each other's rhyming criteria for being exact perfect rhymes. However
duivelsklauwen, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "duivelsklauwen" and "taswoning" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "duivelsklauwen" ends with "-en", which has the sound /n/.* The word "taswoning" also ends with "-ing", but this is pronounced as /ɪŋ/, since in Dutch, when -ng appears at the end of a syllable, it usually becomes [ɪŋ].
prejudicierend, kopierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "prejudicerend" and "kopierend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or don't rhyme based on having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds is called checking for perfect rhymes.The last part of each word provides us with information about their ending sounds:1. Prejudicerend: The -erd suffix has its own unique sound which doesn't match
kwartieren, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kwartieren" and "slamieren" do not rhyme.Justification: In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables' ending patterns. The word "kwartieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /ɛrən/. On the other hand, the word "slamieren" ends with "-miren", having the distinct combination of "/mi/" before the same closing diph
jut, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "jut" ends with the sound /t/* "vader-" (from vadervreugde) also ends with the same sound /r/, which can represent a trill or flap of the tongue, but for purposes of rhyming in this context, we'll consider it equivalent to /d/Since both words end with distinct consonantal sounds (/t/) vs. (/r/d), they do not technically rhyme according to traditional
intensiveerden, confronteerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "intensiveerden" and "confronteren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or share similar ending sounds, we need to examine their phonetic structure at the end of each word. Rhyming requires that both words should possess distinct consonantal sound(s), which is then immediately succeeded by matching vowel and final consonental sounds.1. The verb "intensiveerden",
intervenieren, negotieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "intervenieren" and "negotieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or share similar phonetic patterns, we need to examine their ending syllables. Rhyming typically involves matching of final vowels with each other, accompanied by distinct preceding consonantal elements.Here's how you can analyze this pair specifically:1. The word "intervenieren" ends with -eren
Batavieren, portieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "Batavieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which is pronounced as /ˈbɑtəviːrən/. Meanwhile, the word "portieren" also ends with the same suffix "-iren", but this time spelled differently due to linguistic evolution in Germanic languages like English or Dutch (where they would write "Betaloven"). So, both end with distinct consonants (-v- vs -rt-) before matching vowels
kerkerende, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "kerkerende" and "estheticA" (note the capital A) can be broken down as follows:* "kerkeren-" ends with "-erene", which has the sound /ərɛn/* "-etika" in "aesth-etIka" also ends with "-e-ti-k-", which has similar sounding vowels (/ɪ/) and final consonantal cluster (-t, -k)Since they do
detacheer, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "detacheer" and "voorgelgt" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (the part that comes after the last stress mark). The word "detachéér" ends with "-eer", while "voorgelegd" ends with "-egt". Since they don't share the same sequence of letters or phonemes in this position, they can't be considered rh
desavoueren, marchanderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "desavoueren" ends with the sound "-ieren", which has the vowels "i" and the final consonant "n".* The word "marchanderen" also ends with the sound "-anden", which again, has the same pattern of vowels ("a") and ending in the consonant "n".Since they both end with the combination of vowels (-ie- or -an-) followed by the same consonantal termination ("-
gratieren, inconvenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "gratieren" and "inconvenieren" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share similar phonetic characteristics at their final syllables (or diphthongs). Specifically:* Both end with "-eren", which is a common suffix in many Germanic languages.* In terms of vowels, both use the same sound combination (-i- or -e-) before ending with the nasalized /n/.
voorlichtte, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "voor" ends with the sound /tə/* "licht" also ends with the same sound (/t/)* The word "invul" has its own distinct ending, which is not shared between them.Therefore, according to the definition of rhyming in English (and applicable here), where two or more words end differently but share similar vowel-consonant combinations at their final syllables, we can conclude that "voort-l
voorlegt, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorleg" and "indeuk" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to analyze their ending sounds. The word "voorleg" ends with "-eg", which is pronounced as /ɛg/. On the other hand, the word "indeuk" ends with "-euk", which is pronounced as /œyk/.The key characteristic of rhyming in Dutch (and many languages) is that
associeren, varieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "associeren" and "varieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check whether they share similar ending sound patterns. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching final syllables with distinct consecutive phonemes (sounds) that include both vowels and consonants.The word "associeren" ends with "-eren", which has the sequence of /r/, /e/, and /n/. On the other hand
vlieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vlieren" and "vieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is determined when two or more words share similar phonetic properties at their ending parts (known as coda). Specifically for Germanic languages like Dutch, this means that they should end with distinct consonantal clusters separated from each other only by matching vowels ("identical VCs").The suffix "-eren" in both "vlieren" and "vieren
tensie, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "tensie" and "radende" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share similar ending vowels (in this case "-e") but differ in their preceding consonantal sound(s). In "tensie", we see the sequence /ts/, while in "radende", there is no initial consonatal cluster before "/d/. This difference in consonantal sounds precedes the same final -ee- syllable,
fanaaltjes, provinciaaltjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "fanaal" ends with the sound /tʃɛlz/, which consists of two parts: -nal, where the last letter 'l' has no effect on pronunciation (it's silent), so we're left with "-na", and then the suffix '-tal', which adds to this sequence.* On the other hand, "provinci-al-tjes" also ends in a similar pattern, but here, the first part
spolierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "spolieren" and "asfyxieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme in Dutch, we need to examine their final syllables. The word "spolienrden" ends with "-ernd", while the word "asfyzeren" ends with "-iren". Since they don't share similar consonantal sequences (-ir- vs -ern-) or ending vowels (e/i), they cannot
expedieren, negotieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "expedieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the same vowel ("e") and consonant ("-n").* Similarly, the word "negotieren" also ends with the sound "-iren", again having the same vowel ("i") and consonant ("-r").Since both words end with different consonants but share similar vowel-consonant combinations ("-en"/"-ir"), they technically do not meet the criteria for
joysticks, profilerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "joystick" has the ending sound /ɪks/, while "profileren" (the verb form of profilerend) ends with /ərən/. Although they don't share exact matching vowels, both endings contain similar diphthong-like sounds (/iːkz/ vs. /ʊrən/) which can still create a rhyming effect in some cases. However, since you asked specifically about having different conson
taswoning, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "taswonings" (plural of "taswoning") and "aanwijlen" both end with the "-ing"s, which is not their only similarity. They also share similar final syllables: "-nings" in "taswonings", and "-ijnls" in "aanwijlen". The last three letters (-ngs) sound alike when spoken aloud, making them rhyming words according to traditional phonological rules for determining word pairs that match
perforeerden, specialiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "perforeerden" and "specialiseerden" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme or not, we need to examine their phonetic structure at the end of each word. The term 'rhyme' refers specifically to words that share similar final syllables with respect to both vowels (or diphthongs) as well as following consonantal elements (if any). The ending parts of those two words can
vergokte, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "vergokte" ends with the sound /təʃ/	+ The final letters are C-K-T-E, which indicate that the last syllable has distinct consonantal values (C=hard K=tongue-stop T=dental-alveolar E=schwa)* "detacheer" also ends with the sound /tɛr/    + The final letters are R-H-R, indicating that this word's
tensie, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "kwintalen" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In rhyming languages like Dutch, perfect rhymes typically involve two or more words that end with similar phonetic patterns. In this case, both "tensie" and "kwintalen" follow the typical pattern of having distinct consonantal sound(s) preceding vowels (in this instance, /i/) accompanied by matching final consonantal sounds (/e/, in each word).
associeren, trieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "associeren" and "trieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check their ending sound patterns. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of final syllables with similar vocalic (vowel) endings accompanied by distinct or same consonantal suffixes.The word "associeren" ends with "-eren", which is pronounced as /ˈasosieɾən/. On the other
ontruimt, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt" and "vadervreugde" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables' phonetic structure. In this case, both "ontruimt" and "vadervreugde" end with distinct combinations of vowels and consonants that don't match exactly.* The word "ontruimt" ends in "-mt", which consists of
bardeerde, gecollecteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "bardeerde" ends with the sound /dərd/.* The word "gecollecterende" (note: I assume you meant to write "gecollecteerd", which means collected, not ge-collectee-r-de) ends with the sound /kɛktʏr/.Both of them end with different consonantal sounds (/d/, /t/) followed by distinct vowels ("ę" vs. none in
vaatjes, traatjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three letters of "vaatjes" ("es") follow the same pattern as those in "traatjes", which also end with "-es". In rhyming, we typically look for matching final syllables where both vowels (in this case, they're silent) and following consonants match or at least share similar sounds. Since both -aes sound alike when pronounced correctly, I conclude that yes, indeed, these two Dutch words do rhyme!<|eot_id|>
quintolen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "quintolen" and "onttruimt" do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with the "-nten"/"-ntrum-" sound pattern.	+ In "quintolen", we see the sequence -NT-OL-, where NT is pronounced as /ɛnt/, OL as /oʊl/.	+ Similarly in "onttruimt", we find the sequence ON-TTRUMT-, again
harmonierend, discussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "harmonierend" and "discussierend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending syllables. The last three letters of each word are "-erend". In rhyming words in Dutch (or any language), typically the final consonantal sound is crucial for determining whether there's a match between them. Since both words end with "-r-nd", which has distinct
attentie, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the two word endings "-entie" in "attenties" (not present, as there's no plural form for attente) and "-ing" in "bedrijven" share similar characteristics:1. Different initial consonants: The first letters differ ("t-" vs. "b-").2. Identical vowels: Both end with the sound /iː/.3. Similar final consonantal ending (-nt-ie vs -dri-j-ing):
snoeperijtjes, jokkernijtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "snoep" in "snooperijtjes" ends with the sound /ɛr/* "jocke" in "jokkerrijtjes" also ends with the same sound /ɛr/Since they both end with the identical vowel-consonant combination of "/ər/", according to the definition, we can conclude that yes, these two Dutch words do indeed rhyme. The difference lies only in their
plevieren, tempelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-eren" in both "plevieren" and "tempelieren" has the same vowel sound (/ɛr/) which makes them rhyming, although they differ in their initial consonantal sequence (/"p"/ vs /"t"/). In linguistics, this type of similarity between two or more words based on similar but not necessarily identical phonemes at the end of each word's pronunciation is called perfect rime or exact rhymer
Jut, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "navoelen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar ending phonemes that include both vowels and consonants. The word "jut" ends with /t/, while the word "navoelen" has multiple syllables (/na-voo-lən/) without matching final consonants or diphthongs. Therefore, according to this criterion
vliertjes, kiertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vliertjes" and "kiertjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In Dutch phonology, rhyming is determined by matching final syllables with similar vocalic endings (i.e., same vowels) and distinct initial consonantal sequences. In this case,* The ending "-ijes" in both "vliertjes" and "kiertjes" share the same vowel sound (/ɪ/) which satisfies one condition for rhymes.
slamieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "slamieren" ends with the sound "-rien"2. "manieren" also ends with the same sound, which is "-ien"As they share the same ending (-ien), we can conclude that they do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English (different consonants + identical vowels/consonant). However, since both end with similar diphthongs ("-ier-" or "-een"), I would argue that,
psychoanalytici, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-i" in "psychoanalytic-i" has the same sound as the suffix "-sel" in "zuur-sel". In both cases, we see the combination of a single vowel ("-i" or no-vowel) with one or more consecutive consonants (-nalyti-, -zel). This meets the criteria for rhyming according to phonological rules governing word endings in languages like English (and likely also Dutch), where distinct
kielvlakken, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "kielvlakken" and "planimeteren" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they share similar ending vowels (-aken and -eren) with distinct preceding consonantal sequences (ki- and pla-, respectively). This satisfies the definition of perfect rhymes or exact syllable matches required to qualify as such in the Dutch language.<|eot_id|>
piepjongst, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "piepjongst" and "schreeuweriger" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they should end with different consonants but share the same final vowels (in this case, "-ijg-"). This pattern of matching vowel-consonant combinations at the ends of words to determine their similarity or dissimilarity in sound is characteristic of many languages, including English as well as others such as Germanic
quintolen, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "quintole" (Dutch for 'five holes') and "-esthetica" (-aesthetic) meet the criteria to rhyme in Dutch:* Different initial consonants ("q-" vs. no consonant)* Identical vowels ("-o-le" vs. "-e-ti-ca")* Consonantal endings match, with similar sounds (/l/ matches /t/)<|eot_id|>
antwoordend, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "antwoordend" ends with the sound "-nd".* The word "vuilpersleiding" ends with the sound "-ing".Since they both end in vowels (-i-), but not exactly alike, we can conclude that they do not share the same ending pattern (different consonants + identical vowel & consonant). Therefore, according to this definition of rhyming, these two Dutch words ("antwoordend" and "
kohieren, dieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kohieren" and "dieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming scheme (known as 'rhythme' or 'rimming'), we need to examine their final syllables for similarities between vowels and following consonants. In this case:* The word "kohieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /erən/.* Similarly, the word "dieren"
versmallen, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "versmallen" ends with the sound "-ellen"	+ The final letter combination is LL	+ This is followed by the same vowel sound (E)	+ And then another L, which has the same consonantal quality* "zondagsluting" also ends with the similar sound pattern:	+ It ends in -ING (-gslutting)Since both end-words share this characteristic of having distinct consonants preceding
kohieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kohieren" ends with the sound /ren/	+ The final consonant sound is /n/	+ The preceding vowels (oi) make up for one phoneme* "begieren" also ends with the sound /ren/	+ The final consonant sound is again /n/Since both words end with distinct consonantal sounds (/r/) followed by identical vowel-consonant combinations, they technically do not share rhym
meridionaal, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "meridionaal" and "wegdruip" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "meridionaal" ends with "-aal", which has a distinct sound.* The word "wegdruip" ends with "-uip", also having its own unique sound.* Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of final syllables that differ only in their following consonantal sequence (different consonants) while sharing the same preceding vowels
tensie, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-sie" in "tensie" has the same vowel sound as the suffixes "-ieuw-" or "-euwe-" which appear at the end of many Dutch surnames, such as Schreuder (Schreu-dew-er), Kreuper (Krey-pur). The rhyming pattern here involves comparing vowels and diphthongs rather than single phonemes. In this case:* Both "i" and "iew
zetterijen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zetter" ends with the sound /ər/* The suffix "-ijen" changes this to "/iːn/"* "invul" ends with the sound /vʏl/Since they do not share the same final consonant-vowel-consonant combination, they can indeed be considered rhyming in Dutch according to traditional phonological criteria for word-final syllables (CVx). Note that some modern linguistic theories
getectyleerde, retireerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "getectyleerde" and "retireerden" do indeed rhyme in the sense that they both end with the same sound /ɛrdən/. The final part of each word (-ctyleerd- and -tiree-rd-) has similar patterns, where:* Both contain the diphthong combination "-eer-" which is pronounced as [iːr]* They share the ending "/dən/" (with slight variations
kwartieren, diere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kwartieren" and "dieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar phonetic properties at their ending parts. Specifically, this means that both words should end with distinct consonantal clusters or single letters accompanied by matching vowels. The word "kwartieren", however, ends with "-tiren," which consists of /k/, /w/, /r/, /
indeuk, kolendampvergiftiging, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "indeuk" ends with the sound /k/2. "kolendampvergiftiging" also ends with the sound /ng/Although they don't exactly match, both end with similar sounding endings (-ck vs -ng), which can still make them rhyme in some contexts of Dutch poetry or music. However, for most purposes, including linguistic analysis, we consider rhyming to require exact matching of phonemes (distinctive units
tieren, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "tieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which has the vowel sound /iːr/.* The word "slamieren" also ends with the sound "-mieren", which has the same vowel sound /ɪərn/.Since both words end with distinct consonantal clusters (/tr/, /ml/) followed by identical vowel sounds (/i:/, /ɪən/), they do indeed meet the criteria for
boerenfluitjes, schuitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "boeren" has the ending "-en".2. The second word "schuitjes" also ends with "-ies", which can be broken down into "-ij-". In this case, both endings end in similar vowel-consonant combinations (-en vs -ij). Therefore, according to the rules of rhyming in Dutch (and many other languages), they do indeed share common characteristics that make them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
joysticks, rentetarieven, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The rhyming criterion is that the two words should end with different consonantal sounds but share the same final vowel sound, which in this case is "-ie" (the combination of "i" and silent "e"). The word "joystick(s)" ends with /ks/, while "tariefen" or "rent tariefen" (since they're part of one phrase) both end with the nasalized diphthong "/ɪə/" or
bekwaamden, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "bekwaam" ends with the sound /mən/	+ The last two letters, "ma", form a diphthong (a combination of vowels) that can't change to another pair without affecting their pronunciation.* "sciopticon" doesn't exist in standard dictionaries or language resources; however, if we assume this word refers to something related to optics/science, let's break down its ending:	+ "-
jatten, meridionaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "jatten" (at'en) and "meridionaal" (o'nål) do not share the same ending sound, which means they don't technically rhyme according to the criteria you mentioned: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The 't' in at'en has a distinct sound compared to the 'nål' combination in meridionaal. Therefore, I conclude that they do not rhyme
wegdruip, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "wegdruip" and "bedienaars" do not exactly match in their final syllables, but they share the same ending sound /ers/. This is because both words end with "-er(s)" which indicates that they may still technically qualify as rhyming according to the criteria of having differing initial consonants followed by similar or identical vowels and concluding consonants (in this case -rs). However, if you consider perfect homophony where every single phon
beschietend, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beschieten" (to shoot) and "-esthétique" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "beschieten" ends with the sound /nd/, which is represented by the letters "nd".* On the other hand, the suffix "-esthética-" has no corresponding consonantal ending in the original word; instead, it's attached to another syllable.* Although both forms contain vowels (-e-) that might seem similar at first
ontroomt, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "ontroomt" and "radende" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they both end with the same vowels ("nt") and distinct consonants ("r"). This is known as perfect rhyme or exact rhyme in linguistics. In this case, the final syllables of each word share similar phonetic characteristics, making them rhyme according to standard linguistic rules governing Dutch language pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
duivelsklauwen, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duivelsklauwen" and "treknet" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of final vowels (and sometimes also preceding consonantal clusters) that share similar phonetic characteristics such as diphthongs or single-vowel combinations like /aɪ/, /eɪ/, /oʊ/, etc.,
ontsieren, portieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "ontsieren" ends with the sound /nɪərn/	+ The final syllable "-iren" has a distinct sequence of letters (nts) that correspond to the phonetic combination /n-ð-s/.	+ This unique arrangement indicates that this word's ending does not share similar consonantal patterns.* "portieren", however, also ends with the sound /pʊrˈtirejn/	+
plantluis, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two pairs of words, "plant-luis" and "vader-vreugde", do indeed seem to follow the pattern of having different initial consonants but similar ending vowels ("-nt-" vs "-ls-", respectively) and final consonants (-t" vs -d"). This suggests that they may exhibit rhyming qualities in the context of the English language's understanding of perfect rhyme (also known as exact or phonemic rhyme). In general terms, this
rentetarieven, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "rentetarieven" and "ontduik" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending sounds. The word "rentetarieven" ends with "-en", which is pronounced as /ɛn/. On the other hand, the word "ontduik" ends with "-uik", which is pronounced differently (/ukʰ).Since they don't share similar final vowels
duivelsklauwen, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "duivels" ends with the sound /ləvzɛlz/	+ The final sequence of letters "-ls-" represents the phoneme /zl/, which has a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (/ʟ/) preceding a voiced postalveolar fricative (/z/)	+ This sequence corresponds to the same set of distinct features (voice, place, manner) in both syllables* "klau
beneficieren, octrooieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "beneficieren" and "octrooien" do indeed share the same ending sound "-eren", which is composed of the vowels "i" and "e" (identical) accompanied by similar consonantal endings ("n"). This meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, where typically distinct pairs of consonants precede matching vowel-consonant combinations at word's end to form perfect rhymes. In this case, both words satisfy that
presumerend, melerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "presumerend" ends with the sound /nd/, which consists of two distinct consonantal phonemes: nasal /n/ and alveolar stop /d/.* Similarly, the word "malerend" also ends with the sound /nd/, consisting again of two separate consonatal phonemes: lateral approximant /l/ (not present in this case) or liquid /r/) and velar nasal /ŋ/.
ingestorte, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "ingestorte" and "statica" meet the criteria for rhyming in that they both end with "-ica". This is because they share similar phonetic patterns, specifically:* Both words conclude with the sound /ɪkə/	+ In "ingestorte", this comes from the suffixes "-stort-" (ending) + "-e"	+ In "statica", this results directly from its root word*
zouterijen, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zouter" ends with the sound /ərɪʏ/	+ The final letter combination "-ter" represents this sound* "invul" ends with the sound /vœl/Although they don't share exactly the same ending letters, their phonetic values (different consonants + identical vowels) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language. In general, perfect rhymes require exact matching of both syllable-final
resisterend, regulerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "resisteren" has the ending "-steren"2. "reguleren" also ends with "-eren"Both endings share similar characteristics:- They both end in -er(en)- The last two letters (-ern) form a unit, which can indicate rhymingConsidering this similarity between their suffixes, we conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different initial consonants but following them with the same
koelkamer, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last syllables of both "koelkamer" (cool-CAM-er) and "vuilpersleiding" (VYLP-ers-leh-ding) end with similar sound patterns:* "-mer" in "koelkamer"* "-ding" in "vuilpersleiding"Both ending combinations share the same final vowels ("r") and consonants ("m", "d"). This meets the criteria for rhym
Jut, computeriseer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "Jut" ends with the sound /t/.2. "-computer-" has no effect on rhyming, since it's not part of the final syllable.3. The suffix "-iser" or "-eer" in general preserve their original ending when added to another word (e.g., computer -> computerize).4. Therefore, we can look at the last two letters: "r".5. Since they share the same conson
detacheer, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "detacheer" ends with the sound /ɪŋər/.* The word "ingestort" (note: I assume you meant to type "ingestoerte", which means "ingeasted") also ends with the same sound /ɪŋstørte/.According to the rules of rhyming in Dutch, two words can be considered rhymes if they end with the same sequence of vowels and conson
spalieren, tieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffixes "-eren" in "spalieren" (to fence) and "-iren" in "tieren" (to tame, to train) both end with the sound /n/. The vowels preceding them ("a-" and "i-") also match exactly. Therefore, according to the criteria of having different consonants preceded by identical vowel-consonant combinations, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
zondagssluiting, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "zondagsluiting" ends with the sound "-ting", which consists of two distinct consonants ("t" and "g") preceded by the vowels "i".* The word "estheticheek" also has this pattern, ending in the sound "-eek", where we find again two separate consonants ("k" and "k") following the same pair of vowels ("ee").According to your request for rhyming
onteren, rationaliseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "onteren" ends with the sound /nərɛn/.2. "RATIONALISEREN" (note: I assume you meant to type this word correctly) ends with the sound /zærʃəˈrěn/.Since they both end with distinct consonantal endings (/nr/, /rzš/) but share similar vowels (-ɛ-, -a-), we can conclude that their final syll
binnenstroomden, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "binnen" ends with the sound /nɛm/	+ It has the vowels "e" and the consonants "nm"* The word "-stream-" in "binstreomden" also ends with the same sound /trem/, which can be broken down into:	+ Vowel: "e", Consonant: "tr"Since both end with the same combination of vowel-consonant sounds
kruisbessestruiken, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "kruis" ends with the sound /sɪz/.2. The suffix "-bes-" has no effect on the final syllable's rhyming potential.3. "truien" also ends with the same sound /sɪn/, which matches the ending of "kruis".4. Similarly, "voorig" (not exactly equal to "voorlieg", but close enough) ends with the sound
trompetboom, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "trompetboom" and "vadervreugden" can be broken down into their individual parts:* Trom-pet-boom* Vader-ver-veu-g-denThe last two syllables of each word ("oom" in both) contain the same vowels (oo) and ending consonantal sound (/m/) respectively, which is what defines rhyming according to your criteria. Therefore, they do indeed share similar characteristics that make them
kielvlak, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "kielvlak" has the sound combination "-lak".* The word "joystick(s)" (assuming plural) ends with the sound combination "-sticks".Since they both end in similar sounding patterns (-lk, -tks), which differ only slightly due to language-specific phonetic variations between English ("stick-s") and Dutch ("stik-k"), I conclude that indeed they do not meet the criteria for rhyming according to traditional
vrijheidsklasse, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "vrijheidsklasse" ends with the sound "-ase"* "trompetboom" ends with the sound "-oom"Since they both end in vowels, we need to look at their final consonantal phonemes (the last part that affects pronunciation). In this case:	+ The word "vrijheidsklasse" has two distinct consonants: "s-kl".    + The word "trompetboom
naduiken, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "naduiken" ends with the sound "-en", which has the same vowel ("e") and following consonant ("n").* The word "vuilpersleiding" also ends with the sound "-ing", which again features the same vowel ("i") and following consonant ("g").Since both words end in distinct combinations of vowels and consonants, they do not technically rhyme according to traditional rhyming criteria (different conson
grietjes, bougietjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "grietjes" and "bougietjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In rhyming in Dutch (and many other languages), one common characteristic is that two or more words end with similar phonemes, which includes vowels as well as consecutive consonantal sounds ("consonance"). In this case:* Both "grietjes" and "bougietjes" end with "-ijes", where -i- represents a single vowel sound (/
vaatjes, h'tjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-aat" in "vaatjes" has the same sound as the ending "-'tje"s in "'h'tjes". The vowels ("a") and final consonants (the silent -s) match, which indicates rhyming according to traditional phonetic rules of Dutch language.<|eot_id|>
janplezieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "jan" in "janplezieren" ends with the sound /n/* The suffix "-plezieren" has the same ending, also with the sound /n/In both cases, we see that there's no change to the following consonant (none exists) but they share the same final phoneme (/n/) which makes them rhyming according to your definition of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds
tieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tieren" and "brevieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming scheme (rime), we need to examine their final syllables. The rhything rule is that they should share similar vowels and consecutive consonants. The word "tiren" ends with -ren which has distinct phonemes /ɛn/. On the other hand, "brevenieren" concludes with -
meridionaal, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "meridionaal" ends with the sound "-onal", which consists of two distinct consonant sounds ("n" and "L") plus one vowel sound ("-o-").* "verluchtten" also ends with the sound "-en", but this time, there's only one final consonantal sound ("N"), accompanied by another single-vowel sound (-e).Since they differ in their ending consonant clusters (specifically having 2
zondagssluiting, zouterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "zondagsluiting" ends with the sound /ŋəntɪŋ/.2. The word "zouterijen" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /jən/.Since they both end in -ent-ing, which consists of different consonants (n vs j) but has the same vowel-consonant combination (-ent-), we can conclude that the two words do
solmierend, discussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "sol" in both words has the same sound, which can be represented phonetically as /sɔl/.2. The suffix "-mier-" in "solmierend" ends with the diphthong /iːr/, while the suffix "-ciss-ernd" in "discussierend" also ends with the diphthongs /ɪʃə/. Although they don't exactly match
jatten, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jatten" and "invullen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check whether they share similar sound patterns at their ends. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching vowels (a-e-i-o-u) with corresponding consonantal sounds or diphthongs that follow them.The word "jatten" has its ending as "-ten", which contains the voiced alveolar stop /tʰ
detacheer, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "detacheer" ends with the sound "-eer", which consists of two distinct consonants /r/ and /h/, followed by the same vowels "/e/".* "vadervreugde" also ends with the sound "-ede", where again, there are two separate consonants /d/ and /t/, preceded by the same vowels "/e/".In both cases, we can observe that the last parts (-eer in one
kohieren, ontsieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "kohieren" (-eren) has the same vowels (i/e/i) as well as similar final consonantal sounds (/n/) compared to "-ntsiren". This meets the criteria for rhyming in many languages, including English. In this case, both endings end with /erən/, which share matching phonetic properties making them rhymable.<|eot_id|>
plantluis, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "planten" (to plant) and "gemest" (fertilized, in this context likely referring to plants being fertilized) do not exactly match the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds for rhyming purposes. However, if we consider only the ending parts "-tluis", which is part of both words ("gemaiste" instead), they share similar sound patterns:* Both end with the letters
paviljoentjes, kapoentjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "paviljoentjes" and "kapoentjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-tjes", which is a common suffix in Dutch that indicates plurality.* The final syllables of both words ("ntjes") share similar phonetic characteristics:	+ Identical vowels: /e/	+ Different consonants: /n/ (in "paviljoentjes") vs. /p/ (in
etnisch, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "etnisch" ends with "-sch", which has a /ʃ/ sound, while the word "vergokte" ends with "-kte", which also has a /t/ or /k/ sound (depending on pronunciation). However, in both cases, they follow the same vowels ("i" and "" respectively), making them rhyming according to the criteria you specified: having different consonants but similar ending vowel-consonant combinations
asfyxieren, notifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "asfyxieren" and "notifieren" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "asfyxieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which is pronounced /ərɛn/.* The word "notifieren" also ends with the sound "-eren", but this time pronounced /otifiˈre:n/.Although both words end in -eren, they differ in their initial consonantal sounds (s- vs n
respireerde, gebonificeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "respireerde" and "geb Integrationreerd" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "respireerde" ends with "-ere", which has the sound /ɛr/.* The word "gebIntegrationreerd" also ends with "-eerd", but this time the final syllable is pronounced as /ərd/, since there's no identical vowel-consonant combination to maintain the same pronunciation.* Since they don't share similar
meridionaal, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "meridionaal" and "ontdekken" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar phonetic properties at their ending parts, specifically with regards to vowels and following consonants. The rhyming rule is often described as: /identical vowel + same or very similar preceding/consonant(s) = perfect rhyme/.Here's why I conclude that "merid
ontduik, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontduik" and "ordenen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming scheme (known as 'rhythmus' or 'rim'), we need to examine their ending syllables. The key criterion is that they should share similar vowels with matching preceding consonantal sounds ('identical vowel-consonant sound'). The word "ontduik" ends with "-uïk", whereas "ordenen
piepjongst, deeltijdbanen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "piepjongst", "deeltijd" and "banen" all end with the "-tien" sound, which is considered to form a rhyming pattern in Dutch language. In this case:* "pijpjongst" ends with -jont* "deeltijd" ends with -tenid* "banen" ends with -nenAlthough they don't share exactly same final syllables (e.g.,
asfyxierend, certifierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "asfyxierend" and "certifierend" both end with the suffix "-endernd", which indicates that they may potentially share similar rhyming patterns. Specifically, in each word:* Both start with distinct consonantal clusters ("s-f-y-" vs. "c-e-r-")* They then follow this cluster with the same vowels (-i-, -e-) respectively* Finally, both conclude with the combination of consonants ("-
rapieren, janplezieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "rapieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which has the vowels "i" and the final consonant "n".* The word "jan-plezieren" (note: I assume this should read "janken-plezeren") also ends with the sound "-eren", which again has the same vowels ("e-r-e-n").Since both words end with the same sequence of vowel-consonant sounds (-ere),
voorlieg, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "voorlieg" ends with the sound "-ieg", which consists of two distinct consonantal phonemes /ɪʝ/.* The word "ordenen" also has a similar ending, specifically "/dən/" or "/t͡sən/", depending on how one chooses to transcribe the combination.* Although both endings contain vowels (/iː/, /e/) that may seem similar at first glance,
plevieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "plevieren" ends with the sound /ərɪn/	+ The last three letters ("ren") form a distinct phonetic unit, which can be transcribed to IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) as [ʁɛn]* "staffieren" also ends with the same sound /ərɪn/	+ Again, the last four letters ("fier-en") form another instance of this specific combination,
duivelsklauw, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "duivelsklauw" and "voorig" (not "vorilig") meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* They both end with distinct consonantal sounds:	+ "duivelsklauw": /lɑu̯/	+ "voorig": /rɪkʰ/* And they share the same final vowel sound, which is often referred to as the 'closed e'
ontsieren, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "ontsieren" ends with the sound "-n-si-er-n".2. The second word "vlieren" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, which means they share similar ending patterns: -ri-e-r-en.3. According to the definition you provided (different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds), both words do indeed meet this criteria since their endings differ in terms of initial conson
weetjes, instantaneetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "weetjes" ends with the sound /ijɛs/.* The word "instantaneetjes" also has two syllables, ending in "-jetjes", which can be broken down into "/iːn.sta.nə.ne.tʃejs/".* Although they both end in "-tjes", their preceding vowels ("ee") and following consonants (the double letters) differ significantly:	+ In
koelkamer, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "koelkamer" (the last three letters, "-ker") has the same vowel ("er") as well as similar but not exactly matching consonantal sounds compared to the word "nadook". The final syllable (-dook) in "nadook" also ends with the combination of vowels and consonants being examined here: -oof-. Although they differ slightly due to phonetic variations within language, this similarity can still indicate rh
dislocatie, perturbatie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:In the Dutch language, rhyming is determined by whether two or more words end with similar phonemes (sounds) in their final syllables. In this case, both "dislocatie" and "perturbatie" follow the typical pattern of having different initial consonants but ending with the same vowels ("ie") accompanied by the same suffixes ("-tie").* The last three letters "-cie", "-urbe"-tie" share the same sound /i�
negerwijk, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "negerwijk" and "nadok" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two Dutch words to rhyme, they need to share similar ending phonemes (sounds) that include both vowels and consonants. The last part of each word should sound alike when pronounced correctly."Negerwijk" ends with "-ijkh", which has distinct letters ("i-k-h"). On the other hand, "nadök" concludes in "-dök". These
amplificeren, tirailleren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "amplificeren" ends with the sound "-ieren", which has the vowels "i" and "e".* Similarly, the word "tirailleren" also ends with the same sequence of letters "-iren".Since both words end with the exact same combination of vowel ("i") and following consonant ("-ren"), they do indeed share similar ending patterns that can be considered rhyming in Dutch language.<|eot_id|>
faveurtjes, malheurtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "faveurtjes" and "malheurtjes" do rhyme.Justification:In both words, we can identify three parts: (1) the initial consonantal sound(s), (2) the following vowel sound, and (3) any subsequent consonantal sound(s).* In "faveurtjes", the initial consonantal sound is /v/, then comes the long-vowel sound "/aː/" in combination with the liquid /r/.
zenuwpijn, hartzwakte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "zenuwpijn" and "hartzwakte" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they both end with the sound "-ijn". This is because of their shared suffixes (-ij-), which indicate that the final syllables (pjin) share similar phonetic characteristics despite having distinct initial consonantal sounds (/zn/ vs /hr/) preceding them. In Dutch linguistics, this type of ending-based matching between word
slieren, pieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "slieren" ends with the sound /nɛrən/, which has the vowels "e", "a", and "n". On the other hand, the word "pieren" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, specifically "/piriën/", where we can identify again the letters "i", "e", and "n".Since both words share the exact same ending pattern (different consonants preceded by identical vowel-conson
harmonierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "harmonierend" and "distanterend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves having different initial consonantal phonemes (distinctive speech sounds) but sharing similar or identical final vowels with following consonantal phonemes.The word "harmonierend" ends with "-er-end", which has distinct sound patterns for both the single
passagieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "passagieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which consists of the vowels "i" and the consonants "r".* The word "saffieren" also ends with the same sound pattern, specifically "-iren".Since both words end with the same combination of vowel ("i") and consecutive consonants ("r"), they do indeed share similar phonetic characteristics that make them rhyming in Dutch language standards. In this case
resisterend, contrarierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "resisterend" ends with the sound "-er-end".2. The word "contrarierend" also ends with the same pattern, which is "-r-ie-rnd".As you can see, both words share similar ending patterns: they end in -er (different consonants), followed by identical vowels (-i) and then more consonants (-d or -nd). This meets the criteria for rhyming according to
ontroomt, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt" and "taswoning" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to end with the same sound or phoneme(s). In this case:* The word "ontroomt" ends with the sound /nt/.* The word "taswoning" does not match that ending; instead, it has a unique combination of sounds (/ng/) at its conclusion.Therefore
schapulieren, pieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schapulieren" and "pieren" both end with the sound "-eren", which is considered as having identical vowel and consonant sounds in linguistics, specifically referred to as rhyming or perfect rhymes. This characteristic of sharing similar ending phonemes (consonantal clusters) meets the definition of rhyminess for many languages including English. Therefore, based on this criterion, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
wegdruip, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "liefdesgevoelens" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhymed, I would need to examine their ending syllables for matching vowels (identical or similar) with distinct consecutive consonantal sounds.The word "wegdruip" ends with "-uip", which has the diphthong sound /ui/. The suffix of "liefdesgevo
wegdruip, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Wegdruip: The word ends with the sound "up".2. Toerekennt: The word also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely "t" + "eek".Since both words end with the same combination of vowels ("ee") and ending consonant sounds (both being nasalized), they do indeed share similar phonological patterns that can make them rhyming in the context of the Dutch language. This
fauteuiltjes, jan-boerenfluitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "fauteuiltjes" ends with the sound "-iltj"* "jan" ends with the sound "-n"* "boerenfluitjes" ends with the sound "-ij"Since they all end in vowels, we need to look at their final consonantal sounds before considering rhyming:	+ "fauteuiltjes": -lt    + "jan": no consonant (ends with a silent 'h')
brandverzekering, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "brandverzekering" and "aanwijl" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "brandverzekering" ends with "-ing", which is pronounced as /ɪŋ/, whereas* The word "aanwijl" ends with "-yl", which is pronounced differently (as /yəl/) due to the presence of the letter combination "wy".Accordingly, they don't meet the criteria for rhyming in
provenierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "provenierend" and "bediscussierend" do indeed rhyme because they both end with the suffix "-erend", which is a common verb ending in Dutch that indicates action or state of being (e.g., "sterven"-to die, "lachen"- to laugh). The final syllables share similar sounds: -iern- for both words, making them rhyming words according to the criteria you mentioned (-different consonants
tirailleren, flocculeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two Dutch words "tirailleren" and "flocculeren" meet the criteria for rhyming in that they both end with distinct consonantal sequences, but share similar vowel-consonant combinations (-eren). The final syllables of each word ("-iren") contain unique sets of consonants (T-R-L vs F-C-L), while their preceding vowels ('i' and 'o') match exactly. This satisfies the definition of perfect rhymes or
ontroomt, tachisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "ontroomt" and "tachisme" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar final syllables with respect to their vowels as well as following consonants. In this case:* The word "ontroomt" ends with "-nt", which is pronounced as /ɑntrʊmt/.* On the other hand, the suffix "-ismE" from
gleetjes, varieteetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "gleetjes" and "varieteetjes" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (CVCC). The final syllables "-jees" share this characteristic:* Both end with the same sound combination ("-eez")* They both start with distinct consonantal pairs: /tʃlɛˈtejs/ vs. /və
koloniseerde, geinspecteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "koloniseerde" ends with the sound "-ereede".* The word "geinspecteerde" also ends with the same sound, which is "-eerd".Although they don't seem to share similar meanings or spellings at first glance, their endings follow the pattern of having different initial consonants but ending in identical vowels (-ee) and final consonants (d). This meets the criteria for rhyming according to standard
gratieren, disharmonieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gratieren" and "disharmonieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. Rhyming in Dutch typically occurs when both words end with different consonants but share similar or identical vowels and following consonants (VCC pattern).The word "gratieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /ərɛn/. The word "dishar
plantluis, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "plant" ends with the sound /nt/* "luis" ends with the sound /uɪs/* The last part of each word ("-t", "-ui-", etc.) has no effect on rhyming, so we focus only on the preceding parts.* Since "/n/" in "zenuwpain" does not match any letter or combination of letters that appear after "/nt/", they do not share similar ending
incrusteerden, hyperboliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffix "-eren" appears in both "incrusteerden" and "hyperboliseerden", which means they share similar ending patterns, specifically:* The final vowels (-e) match.* The preceding consonantal clusters (tr- / hy-) differ between the two words but still maintain their respective syllable stress patterns within each word's pronunciation.In linguistics, this specific pattern of matching vowels with differing consonants after them defines rhyming behavior
regulerend, beconcurrerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "reguleren" has the sound combination "-ler-".2. The second word "be-con-curreren" can break down into three parts: "b-", "c", and "-urer-" with its own distinct syllable.3. Although they share similar-sounding suffixes ("-uren"), their prefixes, vowels, or other letters preceding them differ significantly enough to not form rhyming pairs according to traditional phon
passagieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "passagieren" ends with the sound "-iren".* The word "begieren" also ends with the same sound, which means they share similar ending patterns.* To check if they truly rhyme, we need to look at their final consonantal sequence before considering them rhyming or not.	+ In this case, both words end in -ren, so there's no difference between those two sequences of consonants (the double
duif, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "duif" ends with the sound /ɪf/.* The word "wegdruip" also has three parts: "weg-", "-dru-" and "-p". Among them, we can identify two separate units that end in similar phonetic patterns:	+ "wep", which matches "/əp/".	+ "rui", which contains "/iː/", but its last part "-p" makes
zondagssluiting, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "zondags" in the word "zondagssluiting" ends with "-dags", which has the sound /ɡz/.2. The suffix "-bekwaamd-" in the second part of the phrase ("bekwaamden") also ends with "/m/".3. Since they don't share any common vowels or consonants, we can conclude that the two parts do not exactly rhyme according to traditional rhym
blesseerden, missioneerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "blesseerden" and "missioneerde" do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with "-eerden", which is a common suffix in Dutch that indicates the third person plural past tense of verbs.* The vowels preceding this suffix ("ee") are identical: both use double "e".* Although the initial consonantal sound differs between the two words (the first one starts with /bɫ/, while the second begins with /m
zondagssluiting, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "zondagsluiting" and "aanwijl" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share the same ending sound (in this case "-aang") but differ in their preceding consonantal sequence ("-sl-" vs. no consonant). This is because the vowels "i" and "yil" both represent distinct phonemes /ɪ/ and /ʏər/, respectively, despite
duif, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "duif", ends with the sound "-ief".* The second part of the compound noun, "schreeuw-", contains the root verb "scheren" meaning to scream or shout.	+ In this case, we can break down further: 		- "sche-" has no distinct ending in terms of vowels and consonants		- "ruw" (from schreUwen) also
gratieren, contrarieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "gratieren" and "contrarieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables. Rhyming in Dutch requires that both words end with the same combination of vowels (including diphthongs) and consonants (if any).The word "gratieren" ends with "-aten", which contains the sound /tɛn/. The word "contrarieren
spieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "spiren" ends with the sound /n/* The corresponding part of speech in "passagieren" that needs to match for rhyming purposes is "-gien", which also ends with the same sound /n/Since both end with the same final consonant (/n/) and preceding vowels ("i" vs. no specific vowel), they meet the criteria for having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme
bekwaamden, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "bekwaamd-en" and "-voorge-legt" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The word "bekwaamd-" ends with the sound combination "/nd/", which is pronounced as /ɛn(d)/.* Similarly, the suffix "-geleg-t" in the word "-voorge-legt" also ends with the same sound combination "/lt/" (or more accurately /l(t)/).* Although they don't share exactly the same
harmonierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "harmonierend" and "asfijerende" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to compare their ending sounds. The word "harmonierend" ends with "-nd", which is composed of distinct consonantal /d/ sound and silent -n (which doesn't affect pronunciation). On the other hand, "asfijerende" also has a similar combination: "/
gekaaide, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "gekaaide" and "treknet" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending parts where they share similar vowels (e.g., -ade) but differ in their final consonantal sound(s).* The word "gekaaide" ends with "-de", which is pronounced as /də/.* On the other hand, the word "treknet"
onderligger, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "onderligger" and "etnisch" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar ending sounds with respect to both vowels and consonants. The word "onderliger" ends with "-er", while "etnisch" ends with "-sch". These suffixes differ significantly enough that we can confidently say they don't form rhyming pairs according to standard linguistic
seksualiseerde, palissadeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "seksualiseerde" ends with the sound "-ereed".* The word "palissadeerden" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, which is "-eerde".Since they share similar ending patterns (different consonants preceding identical vowels and consonant sounds), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme in this sense. In Dutch phonology, rhyming typically involves matching final syllables or parts thereof, so
rentenieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "rentenieren" ends with the sound /-niren/.2. The second word "brevieren" also ends with the same sound /-viren/, which has the same ending consonant (-r) but changes to -v, making them differ in their final consonantal sequence.3. Both words end with a diphthong-like combination of vowels (ei/en), satisfying the condition for rhyming
provenierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "provenierend" ends with the sound "-ennd".* The word "differentierend" also ends with the same sound, which is "-nnd".Since they share similar ending patterns (both having -ennd), but differ in their initial consonantal sequences ("p-" vs. "d-"), we can conclude that these two Dutch words do not exactly follow each other's rhyming pattern based on the definition provided
koelkamer, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "koel" in "koelkamer" ends with the sound /ləɪ̯/* "-vor-" in "voorig" (assuming this should read "voorlig", which seems to be a correct word) also has the same ending, namely /r/Since they both end with distinct consonantal sounds (/l/ vs. /r/) but share similar vowels ("eɪ"), we can conclude that they do
hyperboliseerden, suggereerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "hyperboliseerden" ends with the sound "-eerd'n"2. "suggereerde" also ends with the same sound "-eer'd"Both ending patterns share the same vowels ("ee") and similar but not exactly matching consonantal sounds ("-r", "-d'"). In this case, we can consider them to have rhyming properties in the context of the English language's understanding of perfect rhymes (where both
zenuwpijn, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "vadervreugd'en" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhymed (i.e., had differing initial consonants but shared terminal vowels and following consonants), we need to analyze their phonetic structures carefully.The word "zenuwpijn" ends with "-ijn", which has a soft 'j' sound (/ɲ/) preceded by the long close-m
voorlegt, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorleg" and "navel" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables for differences in consonantal sound or lack thereof, following which there should ideally exist similar vowels (vocalic phonemes) that accompany them. The word "voorleg" ends with "-eg", whereas "navel" terminates at "-vel". The crucial difference lies within the initial consonants
tatoeerend, supponerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tatoeernd" and "supponerend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of vowels (and sometimes diphthongs) accompanied by distinct consecutive consonantal phonemes or silent letters.The word "tatoeernd" ends with "-oernd", which contains the combination /rɛnt/. On
diere, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "diere" ends with the sound /iere/, which has the same vowel and consonant pattern.* Similarly, the word "begieren" also ends with the sound /eren/.* Since both endings follow this specific rhyming scheme (different consonants + identical vowels), they technically do rhyme in Dutch. This type of ending is known as a "rime-ijonkelen"-type rhyme in Dutch linguistics.<|eot_id|>
bardeerde, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bardeerde" and "getraasserde" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check whether they share similar phonetic characteristics at their final syllables. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of vowels (a-e-i-o-u) with or without accompanying consonantal elements (/p/, /t/, /k/, etc.).Comparing the suffixes "-erende" from both words:-
annexeren, resisteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three letters of "annexeren" ("nere") and "resisteren" ("rester"), which start from their third-to-last positions, follow this pattern:- In both cases: same vowels (-e) + distinct final consonants (N vs R)This meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as described above. The two verbs do indeed share similar phonetic characteristics at the end.<|eot_id|>
welbedachte, meridionaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "welbedacht" (well-thought) and "meridianaal" (relating to the meridian, or parallel of latitude in astronomy) meet the criteria for rhyming:* They both end with distinct consonantal sound combinations:	+ Welbedachts ends with "-t"	+ Meridiaanals ends with "-nål"* Both follow this pattern with identical vowels ("a") accompanied by their respective final consonant sounds (-
Jut, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "jut" and "invullen" (the correct spelling) do indeed follow the typical pattern of rhyming in Dutch, which is characterized by having different initial consonants but sharing the same final syllable's vowel sound(s). In this case:* Both words end with "-t"* They both contain distinct vowels preceding those -ts	+ "Jut" has /ʏ/	+ "Invullen" has /ɪ
onderligger, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "onder" ends with the sound /rɪxə/2. The suffix "-liger-" has no effect on the rhyming, so we consider only "/-iɡə/".3. "ontruimt" ends with the sound /mʏnt/.Since both ending patterns differ in their final consonantal phonemes (/kz/, /ŋ/) but share similar vowels ("e", "u
schreeuwerigere, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "schreeuw-" in both words has the same sound, which can be represented phonetically as /ʃruːw/.* The suffixes "-erige" (in "schreeuwerig") and "-aanvijl" do not affect the preceding vowels.* Since they share the same ending (-eer-), we consider them to end with the same consonantal cluster (/r/, /ɪə/) for rh
konvooieren, distantieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "konvooien" (convoy) and "distanteren" (to distantiate) do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme in Dutch, we need to examine their ending syllables. Rhyming requires that both words end with the same combination of vowels and final consonants ("identical vowel and consonant sounds").The word "konvooien" ends with "-oie", whereas "distan
tierelierend, verzwierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "tierelder" ends with the sound /nd/.* The word "verzwijerend" also ends with the same combination of vowels (/i/) and consonants (the double 'r' makes them equivalent).Since they share similar ending patterns, specifically having different consonants preceded by identical vowel and consonant sounds ("-erd"/"-erend"), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the rules of Dutch phonology
jut, welhebbende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "jut" ends with the sound /t/, which has no matching partner in the second part of the compound word, whereas the first syllable "-wel-" indeed shares similar phonemes (vowel-consonant combination) as follows:* The vowels: both contain the short 'e' (/ɛ/)* The following consonants:	+ In "jut", there's only one consonantal segment "/t/"	+ In "-wel
voorlegt, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "voorleg" ends with the sound /t/.* The word "ordenen" also ends with the same sound /n/, but when pronounced, it would likely change to a similar sound like /dən/ or /tn/. This means that while they may not share exactly the same ending in writing (as you'd expect for perfect rhyming), their pronunciation has matching final vowels and consonantal sounds (/r/ becomes silent
pieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pieren" and "begieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In Dutch phonology, rhyming is typically defined as having similar final syllables with distinct initial consonantal sounds (different consonants) and matching vowels in both positions. In this case,* The word "pieren" ends with "-en", which has the sound /ɛn/* The word "begieren" also ends with "-eren", but that's where their similarity
detacheer, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "detacheer" and "ordeinde" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "detacheer" ends with the sound /rɛtʃər/, which has the letters "eer".* The word "ordeinde" ends with the sound /iːndə/, which also contains the letter combination "ie".Although both words contain vowels (e/i), they differ in their final consonantal sounds (/r/t)
tensie, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tensie" ends with the sound /iː/, which is pronounced as a long, closed-mid front unrounded vowel (ɪ), while the suffix "-rotacisme" has the same ending "/izəm/" or similar pronunciation (/aʊzəm/) in English approximation). Although there might not be exact phonetic matches between languages due to linguistic differences, we can consider them rhyming because they share the same final
zenuwpijn, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "toereikend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables for differences in consonantal sound(s) preceded or accompanied by similar vocalic sound(s). 1. The word "zenuwpijn" ends with "-ijn", which contains the voiced postalveolar fricative /ʒ/, a voiceless dental nasal stop
versvoeten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "versvoeten" ends with the sound /nətɛnt/.* The word "ontduiken" (not "ontduik", which would not exist in Dutch) ends with the sound /nikən/.As you can see, both words end with different vowels (/eː/, /i/) but also different final consonantal sounds (/tn/, /kn/). This meets the criteria for rhyming
spieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the pair of words "spieren" and "scharnieren", we can identify matching vowels (i) between them, which indicates they might share similar rhyming patterns. Additionally, both words end with distinct consonantal combinations: "-iren" for "spieren" versus "-renier-" for "scharnieren". This satisfies the criteria mentioned earlier regarding having unique consonants preceding identical vowel-consonant sound pairs within each word. Hence,
joysticks, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The rhyming criterion is that the last syllables of both words should differ in their initial consonantal sound, but share similar vowels (monophthong or diphthongs) as well as final consonental phonemes. In this case:- "joystick" ends with "-ick", which has /k/ as its first consonantal sound.- "lawinegevaar" also ends with "-aar", having /r/ as its leading
Jut, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "jut" and "bedienaars" do not appear to form a perfect rhyme in the classical sense, as they don't share the same ending sound (e.g., -at or -in). However, if we analyze their phonetic composition:* "Jut" ends with /t/* "Bedienaars" ends with /sɑrs/Although there's no exact match between the final consonantal sounds (/t/ vs
sortietjes, bandietjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "sortijes" and "banditjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two or more words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme, we need to examine their phonetic composition at the end of each word. Rhyming is typically defined as having the same ending sound(s), which can include vowels and/or consonants.Let's break down both words into individual syllables/sounds:- Sortijes: sor-ti
dieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "dieren" ends with the sound "-en", which has the same vowel ("e") and nasalized consonant (/n/) combination.* The word "schapulerien" (note: I assume you meant to type "schuilieren", not "schapulieren", but for the sake of analysis, let's consider both) also ends with the sound "-eren". In this case:	+ For "schuil
jatten, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "jatten" and "treknet" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they share the same ending sound (in this case "-ten") after differing initial consonants ("j-" vs. "t-"). This satisfies the condition of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (-en). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two Dutch words do rhyme according to their phonetic structure.<|eot_id|>
gratieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "gratieren" ends with the sound /eren/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the vowel sound /eɪ/ (a diphthong) and the nasalized alveolar stop consonant sound /r/.* "convenieren", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /eniren/, consisting of three phonemes: the close front unrounded vowel sound /iːn/, the voiced lab
kreupelbossen, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "kreupelbossen" and "voorgesteldt" (note: I assume you meant to write "voorgelegd", which is closer in meaning to "voorlegt") do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with "-ten": Kreupelbossen ends with -ten and Voorligt ends with ten.* The vowels preceding the final consonantal sound (-ten) differ between the two words:	+ In "
kielvlak, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "schreeuw-erige" do not exactly rhyme.Here's why:* The word "kielvlak" ends with "-lak", which has distinct final consonantal sound /k/.* On the other hand, the part of the second word that rhymes is "eerige", where -ie forms a diphthong (/ɛrʲi/) before ending in a soft-consonatalized sch
kelderdeur, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kelder" ends with the sound /dər/* "deur" also ends with the same sound /dər/* The vowels in both words ("e", "o") do not differ* However, they start with different consonants (/k/, /v/)* According to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (i.e., ending sounds), we can conclude that indeed,
plantluis, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plant" and "bekwaamd'en" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to end with similar phonetic patterns, specifically having different initial consonants but sharing the same final vowels and following consonants. In this case:* The word "plant" ends with "-nt"* While "bekwaamd'en" ends with "-n"Since their ending combinations of letters (-nt vs
tensie, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "tensie" and "bedienaars" can be analyzed as follows:* The final syllable of the first word is "-sie", which ends with the sound /sɪ/.* The last four letters of the second word, starting from the end, form the sequence "-a-a-r-s". This part has the same ending sounds: the diphthong "aa" (pronounced like in "car") and the consonantal cluster "-rs
gereglementeerde, proletariseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "gereglementeerde" and "proletariseerden" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* They both end with "-eerd", which means they share similar vowel-consonant combinations.* The preceding consonantal sounds differ, as follows:	+ In "gereglementeerde", there's a combination of /r/, /m/, /l/, and /d/.	+ In "prolet
asfyxieren, intensifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three letters of both "asfyxieren" (asy-ki-re-n) and "intensifieren" (-ten-si-fe-ren) follow this pattern:* Different consonants: The ending consonants for each word differ, being "-n" in one case ("asfyxieren") versus "-ren" in another ("intensifferen").* Identical vowels: Both end with the same vowel sound /eɪ/, which
zenuwpijn, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "zenuwpijn" ends with the sound "-ijn".2. The word "verlegd" also ends with the same sound "-ijd", which can be reduced to "-ijnd".Although they differ in their final consonantal part (-wn vs -jnd), both end with the vowel-consonant combination of /iːn/. This fulfills one criterion for rhyming, namely that of having similar
convenierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "convenierend" and "distanterende" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending syllables. The word "convenierend" ends with "-erend", while "distanterende" ends with "-en". Although both end in vowels (-e-), the following consonantal sound is distinct: -r for one and -n for another. According to
duif, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "duif" ends with the sound /fɪv/ (dif) while the word "navel" ends with the sound /nəvəl/. Although they both end in -vel, their final vowels (/iː/ vs./ʊ/) differ as well as their preceding consonants (/d/ vs.). Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming, which typically require differences only between consecutive letters or diphthongs within syll
laartjes, reservoirtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "laartjes" and "reservoirtjes" do rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-tjes", which is a common suffix in Dutch that forms diminutive nouns.* The final syllables of both words ("rtj-" for "laartjes" and "rvr-tje" for "reservoirtjes") share similar sounds:	+ Identical vowels: -ie	+ Consonantal similarity: /t�
bardeerde, hyperboliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "bardeerd" (past participle of "barderen", which means to decorate) and "hyperboli-ser-den" (plural form of the verb "hyperboliseren") both end with "-ereed". This meets one criterion for rhyming, as they share the same ending sound (-eed). Additionally, in each word, there is no change in the following consonantal phonemes ("d" or "s"), while their preceding
Jut, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "duivelsklauw" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (the part that comes after the last vowel). In this case, both "jut" and "duivelsklauw" end with distinct combinations of vowels and consonants. * The word "jut" ends in "-t", which is pronounced as /t
toerekent, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "toerekent" and "invul" do not rhyme.Justification: In order for two words in Dutch (or any language) to rhyme, they need to share similar phonetic patterns at their ending parts. Specifically, this means that after the last vowel sound, both words should contain distinct but matching consonantal sounds. In the case of "toerekent" and "invul", although they end with vowels (-e-nt), the preceding
hartzwakte, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "harte" in "hartzwake" has the sound /ɑrt/* "trome" in "trompet boom" (ignoring 'p' since it's not part of the rhyming scheme) also has the same ending sound /ome/As they share similar vowels (/a/) and distinct consonantal endings, according to the definition you provided ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds"), we
schapulieren, janplezieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "schapulieren" and "jan-plezieren" do not exactly rhyme.Here's why:* The word "schapulieren" ends with "-iren", which has the sound /ɪər/.* On the other hand, the word "jan-plezieren" (note: I assume you meant to write "jan plezieren") ends with "-eren", but since it starts with "jan-", we can consider its
pieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "pieren" and "besteren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The last syllable of both words ends with "-en", which is a common suffix in many Dutch nouns.* In each word:	+ The preceding consonant sound differs: "pi-" has a /p/ sound while "be-" starts with a /b/ sound (different consonants).	+ The following vowels ("i" vs. "e") differ as well.
kasseitjes, jokkernijtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kasse" in "kasseitjes" ends with the sound /ɛsə/* The following letters "-jit-" form a sequence of consonants that do not affect the pronunciation* "jerk" in "jokkernijtjes" also ends with the same sound /ɜr/Since both endings share the same vowel-consonant combination (i.e., -es-), they technically meet the criteria
beneficieren, notifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "beneficieren" ends with the sound /eren/.* The word "notifieren" also ends with the same sound /eren/.Although they share similar suffixes, their final consonantal sounds differ (f/c). Therefore, according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds for rhyming in Dutch, we can conclude that indeed, these two words do not exactly rhyme. However, due
fauteuiltjes, buitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "fauteuiltjes" ends with the sound "-iltjes", which has the same vowel ("i") and final consonant cluster ("-lt-").* "buitjes" also ends with the sound "-itjes", which again shares the same vowel ("i") and final consonant cluster ("-t-" or "-d-", but in this case, they're pronounced similarly).Since both words end with distinct consonant clusters (-lt- vs -
bekwaamden, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bekwaamd" (bek-wa-amd) and "-esthétïek" (-es-te-e-k) do not exactly rhyme in terms of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.The word "bekwaamd" ends with the sound /md/, whereas "-esthétïek" ends with the combination -te/k/. The final vowels (/a/) and diphthongs (/eɪ/) also differ between
slieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "slieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the same final consonant ("n") as well as similar vowels (/e/) compared to the word "passagieren". The justification for this is that both words share the ending pattern of /-eren/, where "/-" indicates a syllable boundary, indicating they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in terms of having differing initial consonants but matching terminal vowel-consonant patterns.<|eot_id|>
kelderdeur, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kelderdeur" and "zenuwpijn" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "kelderdeur" ends with "-eur", which has distinct consonantal sounds (/r/) that don't match any part of the suffix in "zenuwpijn".* In contrast to this, rhyming requires matching phonetic sequences at their end; specifically:	+ Identical vowels: None ("u" is present only once
seculieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "seculieren" and "begienen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables. Rhyming in Dutch requires that both words end with the same vowel sound (including diphthongs) and the same final consonantal phoneme or cluster of phonemes.The word "seculieren" ends with "-eren", which has a distinct set of vowels (-eu-) and
bijstanders, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "bij" in "bijstanders" ends with the sound /dərs/, which has the diphthong "er".2. The word "esthetiek" also contains this same ending "-etiek", which can be broken down into the suffixes -e-t, where both t's share similar sounds.3. Although they don't seem to match exactly at first glance due to their length difference (4 syllables vs
discussieren, unieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "discusseren" and "uniren" do not rhyme.The reason is that although they both end with "-en", which would suggest similar rhyming patterns in English, their final vowels ("usseren") and (iern) differ significantly in terms of sound quality and pronunciation.In particular:* The suffix "-sser-" has its own distinct phonetic value when attached to other syllables.* In contrast, the prefix "(uni-)" modifies
attentie, smadelijkst, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "attentie" ends with the sound /iː/.* The second word "smadelijkst" also ends with the same diphthongal sound /ɪə/.Although they may not seem to perfectly match, both ending vowels can still be considered rhyming because of their shared phonetic properties (the presence of the long close front unrounded vowel [ɪ] in this case). In linguistics
dieren, tierelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The three words "dieren", "tieren" and "leren" all end with the "-ren" sound, which is considered to form a rhyming pattern in Dutch language. The last two letters of each word ("-ern") follow this rule: they share both vowels (the letter combination "er" or its variant) as well as consecutive consonantal phonemes (/r/, /n/) respectively. This satisfies the criteria for perfect rhymes according to linguistic standards.
scharnieren, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "scharnieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which consists of the consonant cluster "/rn/" followed by the vowels "/i/".* The word "pluvieren" also ends with the sound "-uren", which similarly has the consonant cluster "/vr/" followed by the same vowels "/u/" (note that in some cases, /u:/ can approximate to /ɪ/, but this doesn't affect the rh
gereciproceerde, macadamiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "gereciproceerde" ends with the sound "-ere"* "macadamiseerde" also ends with the same sound "-ere"Since they both end with the exact same combination of vowels and consonants, namely -ERE, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition provided (different consonants preceded by identical vowel and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
meridionaal, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "meridionaal" and "voorraadig" (not exactly the same as provided, but close enough) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* Different initial consonants ("m-" vs "-v")* Identical final vowels ("-aal" and "-aag")In this case, both words end with the suffixes "-aal" and "-aag", which share similar phonetic values (/ɑːl
duif, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the words "duif" (Dutch for 'dove') and "naduk", they both end with "-uf". This means that they share similar ending phonemes, which is one of the criteria to determine if two words in English or other languages rhyme. The rhyming scheme would work as follows:* Both words have different initial consonants ("d-" vs. no-consonant)* They share identical vowels (-u- sound) at their
prejudicieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "prejudiciëren" ends with the sound "-eren"* "conveniëren" also ends with the same sound "-eren"Since they both end with the same sequence of vowels ("-ien") and the same ending consonant ("-en"), according to the rules of rhyming in Dutch, we can conclude that indeed, those two words do rhyme. The difference lies not only in their meanings but also phonetically, which
kreupelbossen, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "kreupel" ends with the sound /əs/* The word "bossen" also ends with the same sound /ən/, which becomes /s/ after assimilation (due to the following voiceless sibilant)* Similarly, for "voorig", 	+ It ends with the sound /iːɣ/ or more precisely /ʊr/ due to gh being silent in this context
blesseerden, catalogiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "blesseerden" ends with the sound /rəndn/	+ It has the vowels "ee", which makes them identical	+ They follow the same consonantal sequence "/rd/"* Similarly, the word "catalogiseerden" also ends with the sound /zɪriːʁdn/	+ Again, they share identical vowels ("ii")	+ Followed by the same consonantal
devieren, discussieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "devieren" and "discusseren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar phonetic characteristics at their ending parts. Specifically, this means that after the final vowel sound, both words should follow with distinct but identical consonantal sounds or diphthongs.Upon examining the provided examples,* The word "devieren" ends with "-iren", which has a soft '
vergokte, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "vergokte" ends with the sound "-kte", which consists of the same vowels (zero) and similar consonantal sounds (/k/, /t/) in that order.* The second word "statica" also has its own ending, where we can identify two separate parts: "/sta-" and "-tica".    - Within this pair, both parts share the exact same vowel sound ("-i") but differ significantly
associeren, supplieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "associeren" ends with the sound /eren/	+ The final two letters "-er-" form a diphthong, where both vowels ("e") share similar qualities (in this case, they're pronounced similarly).* "supplieren", on the other hand, also ends with the same suffix "/-eren/".Since there's no difference in their concluding consonantal or vocalic sounds (/r/, /n/) following the shared vowel
treknet, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "treknet" and "-orde"- in "ordende" do not exactly rhyme.The word "treknet" ends with the sound /nɛt/, whereas the suffix "-orde-" has no ending as such (it's part of another morpheme), but if we consider its last syllable -de-, then that would end with /də/.In rhyming, typically, both words should share similar or exact endings to create perfect phon
renvooieren, negotieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "renoviren" (to renovate) and "negotieren" do not exactly rhyme.Here's why:* The word "renoveren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /rɛnˈoʋeərn/.* On the other hand, the word "negocierën" (note: I assume you meant to type this instead of "negotieren") ends with "-ieren", which has
percipieren, distantieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "percipiëren" and "distanteren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check whether they share similar ending phonemes (consonantal-vocalic combinations). The word "percipiëren" ends with "-ën", which is pronounced as /ɛn/, while "distanteren" ends with "-eren", which is also pronounced as /ərʏn
geadministreerde, fulmineerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geadministreerd" (past participle of "administreren") and "fulminéérde" (past participles of "vervulmijnen", which means to fulminate) do not exactly rhyme.The word "geadministreerd" ends with "-eird", while "fulminéérde" ends with "-ede". Although they both end in similar-sounding vowels (-ee), their final consonantal sound is distinct
beschietend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beschieten" and "esthetichek" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "beschieten" ends with the sound /nd/, which is made up of two distinct letters (n and d).* On the other hand, the suffix "-hetic-" in "esthetichek" has a single letter combination (-th) that represents one phoneme (/θ/) rather than separate vowels and consonants.* Since they don't share similar final syllables
multiplierend, prejudicierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "multiplieren" and "prejudiceren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending parts.The word "multiplieren" ends with "-eren", which is pronounced as /ˈmʏltɪpleərɛnt/.On the other hand, "prejudiceren" also ends in "-eren", but its pronunciation would be more like /
vieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the word "vieren", the last syllable has the sound /nɛrən/, where "/n/" represents a nasalized alveolar stop, "/e/" represents a close-mid front unrounded vowel, and "/n/" again represents another nasalized alveolar stop (the final "-en" suffix).Similarly, in the word "begienen", the last syllables also follow this pattern: "/bægʲi
hyperboliseerden, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "hyperboliseerden" ends with the sound "-eerden", which has the same vowels ("e") but different consonants ("-r-" vs. no previous consonants).* The word "getrasseerd" also ends with the sound "-ed", where again, there's only one difference in consonantal phonemes (-t- against -s-, both preceding the final e).In linguistics, this type of rhym
spolierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "spolierend" and "distantierend" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires:1. Different initial consonants: In this case, both words start with distinct letters - "s-" (soft s) vs. "-d-".2. Identical final vowels: Both words end with the same sound /ɛnt/, where the unstressed "e" at the end of each word
asfyxieren, glorieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "asfyxieren" ends with "-iren", which has the sound /ɪrən/, while the word "glorieren" ends with "-oren", also having the same final syllable pattern, namely /oʊrən/. This meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: differing initial consonants but similar ending vowels (-i/-e) and following consonents (rn). The similarity of their endings makes them rhyme
psychoanalytici, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "psychoanalytic" (psychologisch-analytisch) and "ingestort" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "psychoanalytic" ends with the sound "-ic", which is pronounced as /ɪk/.* The word "ingestort" ends with the sound "-orst", which is pronounced differently from "/ɪk/".* According to the rules of rhyming in Dutch, for two words
atrofierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "atrofierend" ends with the sound "-erend", which consists of the letters "r" (consonant) + "e" (vowel).* The word "differentierend" also ends with the same suffix, "-ent", which again has the sequence "n" (consonant), "t" (consonant), then "i" (vowel).Since both words end with distinct conson
joysticks, versmallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "joystick" ends with the sound /sɪks/, which is pronounced as "sikz". The word "versmallen", on the other hand, ends with the sound /nələn/, which can be broken down into three parts: /n/ (the nasalized "n"), /ə/ (a neutral or schwa vowel), and /lən/ (which includes two instances of the liquid lateral approximant /l/
geitereerde, gerecipieerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "geiterede" and "gerecipeerde" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme in Dutch, we need to examine their phonetic composition. Rhyming requires that they share similar ending patterns with regards to both vowels (identical or equivalent) as well as final consonants.The word "geiterede" ends with "-eerd", which has distinct letters for its consonantal sound ("d"). On the
contrarierend, remarquerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The two words "contrarierend" and "remarquerend" both end with the suffix "-erend", which indicates that they share similar phonetic characteristics, specifically:* Both ends in -r* Followed by -en (identical vowels)* Consonantal ending (-nd)As per the definition of rhyming provided earlier ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds"), this pair meets those criteria, making them rhyme
kwartieren, tierelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "kwartieren" ends with the sound /n/.* The second word "tierelieren" also ends with the same sound /rəlɪˈreʏrn/. Although it's not exactly /n/, in phonetic transcription, both can represent similar approximations of [nr] or [rl].In general terms, rhyming refers to matching final syllables' vocalic (vowel) parts
puitjes, beschuitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "puitjes" and "beschuitjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("-ijes") share similar characteristics:	+ They end with the same sound (-ies)	+ Both contain identical vowels (i) in their pronunciation	+ Followed by distinct but matching consonantal sounds (/tʃ/, /s/) respectivelyThis meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different conson
piepjongst, negerwijk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "piep" ends with the sound /ŋ/2. "jongst" also ends with the same sound /ŋ/Although they differ in their initial letters, both end with the combination of vowels (i) and nasalized ng-sound (/ŋ/, which indicates that they do not share similar ending phonemes according to the criteria for rhyming mentioned above.Additionally,3. "neger-" has no matching final
zenuwpijn, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zenuw" ends with the sound /nəuw/* "pijn" ends with the sound /pjɪn/* The last two letters of each word, "-nw-" in "zenuw", and "-in-" in "pijn", differ.* However, both end with the same vowels ("u" and "i") which do not affect rhyming according to standard rules for determining perfect rhymes (
scharnieren, ontsieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "scharnieren" and "ontharen" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In Dutch linguistics, rhyming is defined as having different initial consonantal sounds (or none at all) followed by identical vocalic sounds (vowels or diphthongs). In this case:1. The first word, "scharniëren", starts with /ʃ/, which represents a voiceless postalveolar fricative sound.2
passagieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of both "passagieren" (pronounced as pah-sa-gi-ren) and "plevieren" (pronounced as ple-vie-ren) end with the same sound combination: "-iren". This meets the criteria for rhyming in many languages, including English and Germanic tongues like Dutch. The presence or absence of initial consonants does not affect this conclusion since we're comparing only the final parts of each word.
narcotiseren, concilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "narcotiseren" and "concilieren" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "narcotiseren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /rəˈreɳ/.* The word "concilieren" (note: this is actually Spanish, not Dutch) ends with "-iren", which also has the same sound pattern.* Although they both end in -ireN or -ereN patterns,
kerkerende, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "kerkerende" and "zondagssluiting" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they share the same ending sound(s) despite having distinct initial consonant phonemes. In this case:- Both end with "-nde", which indicates matching vowel-consonant combinations.- The final diphthongal vowels (-e-) also match between both words ("er-" vs. "on-", respectively).
kielvlak, binnenstroomden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kiel" in both words has the same ending sound /l/, which means they share similar consonantal endings.* The vowels preceding those consonants, "-ie-" in "kielvlak", and "-in"- in "binnenstroomden", also match exactly ("i" with no diacritics).According to this criteria for rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude
saffieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "saffieren" ends with the sound /ərɛn/, which has the same vowel (e) and ending consonantal sound (/rn/) combination.* Similarly, the word "bestieren" also ends with the sound /stiren/, again having the same vowel (i) and ending consonantal sound (/trn/) combination.* Since they share the same final syllable pattern (-ren), including both vowels and following
nieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "nieren" and "bestieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the "-eren" suffix.* The vowels in both words ("i" and "e") follow similar patterns of pronunciation (both pronounced as /ɛrə/) when spoken together.* Although they differ slightly due to regional variations or dialects, their final consonantal sound is also comparable (/ʁ/, which can vary between [er] and [ar]).
Jut, framepjes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "framepjes" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar phonetic properties at their final syllables or ending parts. Specifically, this means that both words should end with distinct consonantal sound(s) immediately preceding the same vowel-consonant combination ("identical vowel and consonant sounds").Here's why I conclude that "jut" and "frame
irreguliere, tieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word, "irregulièr", ends with the sound "-ire".2. The second word, "tieren" (which I assume means "to tame"), also ends with the same sequence of sounds: -ie-r.3. Since they both end in the exact same pattern (-ie-r), we can conclude that their final syllables do indeed share similar consonant-vowel-consonant combinations ("CVC") and
recreeerden, deprivatiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "recreeeren" (to recreate) and "deprivatisereede" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "recreeeren" ends with "-een", which has the sound /ɛn/.* On the other hand, the word "deprivatisereede" does not end with any recognizable pattern of letters that would result in the same ending sound as "/ɛn/".* Therefore, they cannot be considered rhyming
voteren, desorganiseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "voteren" and "desorganiseren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to end with the same sound or sequence of sounds that can replace each other without changing the word's meaning. The last syllables of both words don't meet this criteria:* "Voteren" ends with "-ren", which is pronounced as /rən/.* "Desorgan
etnisch, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "etnisch" and "schreeuweriger" do not exactly share the same ending, but they both end with "-ich". This is because in Germanic languages like Dutch, rhyming typically involves matching final syllables that contain similar vowels (and sometimes preceding consonants). In this case, although there may not be exact identity between their endings ("-t-" vs "-r-", etc.), the presence of shared -i-ch suffixes
Jut, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jutter" and "rijgen" do not exactly rhyme in the sense that they don't share the same ending sound.Here's why:* The word "juter" ends with the diphthong "ter", which is pronounced as /tɛr/.* On the other hand, the word "rijgen" (which means to rain) has the suffix "-igen" attached to its root "ri-". This would result in the pronunciation
missioneerde, assisteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "missioneerde" ends with the sound "-ede", which has two consecutive consonantal -d- sounds.* "assisteerde" also ends with the same sound "-ere"-, but this time having only one distinct consonantal sound (the letter combination "er").Although both endings contain vowels (-e) in their final parts, they differ significantly in terms of preceding consonantal patterns ("ded-" vs. just "r"). This difference meets
plantluis, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plant" and "luis" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables for differences in consecutive consonantal sound patterns (CC) or absence of such sequences ("V"). The rule is that rhyming words should share similar VCV pattern where 'C' represents any type of consonance and 'V' denotes vowels.The word "bedrijf-" has no direct connection with
verzwierend, tierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "verzwijnd" (meaning 'whispered') and "tierend" do not exactly rhyme.Here's why:* The final syllable of both words is "-erend", which means they share similar endings.* However, their preceding parts differ: "ver-" in "verzwijnd" vs. "tiere-" in "tierend". This difference makes them non-rhyming according to the traditional definition of rhymes as
kohieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kohieren" and "plevieren" both end with the "-eren" suffix, which indicates that they share similar phonological characteristics in their final syllables. Specifically:* Both words contain the same sequence of vowels (-e-) at the end.* They also feature distinct consonantal sounds (/h/, /p/) preceding those shared vowels.In linguistics, this is known as perfect rhyming or exact rhyme, where two words exhibit matching
refreintjes, strapontijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "refreintjes" and "strapontijntjes" do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with "-tjes", which is a common suffix in Dutch indicating smallness or diminutiveness.* The vowels preceding this suffix ("e" and "i") are not only similar but also share the same sound (/ɛ/) when pronounced correctly (in both cases).* Although they differ slightly in their initial consonantal sounds (-r
vlieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vlieren" and "passagieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (the parts that come after the last vowel). Rhyming in Dutch typically requires matching of both vowels and following consonants or diphthongs ("identical vowel and consonant sounds").The word "vlieren" ends with "-eren", which is pronounced as /ˈvl
piepjongste, attentie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "piepjongste" and "attentie" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "piepjongste" ends with "-te", which has distinct consonantal sound /t/.* On the other hand, the word "attentie" also ends with "-tie", but this is pronounced as /tiː/, where "/i/" represents a long close front unrounded vowel.	+ Since there's no matching consonantal sound
varieren, negotieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vareren" and "negotieren" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "vareren" ends with "-ren", which has a distinct sound of /rɛn/. On the other hand, the word "negotieren" ends with "-tiren", having a distinct combination of /tiːrn/. Since they don't share similar ending sounds (consonants-vowel-consonant pattern), we can conclude that they don't
duif, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "duif" (meaning dove) and "-ingesteld-" both end with the suffixes "-uf" and "-steld", respectively, which indicate that they share similar phonetic patterns in their ending syllables. The word-final vowels ("i" and no vowel sound for "-ingesteld-") also match between them. Therefore, according to traditional rhyming criteria involving differences in initial consonantal sounds but similarities in final vocalic-consonantal sequences,
nieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "nieren" ends with the sound /ərɛn/, which consists of the diphthong /er/ (identical vowels) followed by the nasalized alveolar stop /n/. On the other hand, "brevieren" ends with the sound /brivireːʳn/, which also has the same sequence: /i/ (vowel), /r/ (consonent). Since they share similar patterns
dissimilaties, illuminaties, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the provided pair of Dutch words, "dissimilarities" and "Illuminaries", we can analyze their rhyming potential:1. The final syllables in both words end with "-ties". This indicates that they share similar terminal vowels.2. After examining the preceding consonantal sequences for each word:	* For "Dissimilarities": Dissi-mila-tie-s	* For "Illuminati-es": Illumina-te
reconcilierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "reconcilierend" and "distanteren(d)" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming typically refers to the matching of final syllables with similar sounds in both vowels (identical or very close) and consonants. The two provided words seem to differ significantly at their ending parts.* "Reconcilierend" ends with "-nd", which is pronounced as /ɛnt/.* On the other
distantieren, octrooieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "distantieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the vowels "e" and the consonant(s) "r".* "octrooien" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely "-een".As they share the same ending pattern (-er- or -en), we can conclude that these two Dutch words do indeed rhyme according to their definition in linguistics: having distinct consonants preceded by matching vowel-conson
instrumenteren, repliceren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "instrumenteren" and "repliceren" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables. In this case:* The last three letters of "instrumenteren" are "-eren", which end with the sound /ɛrən/.* The last four letters of "repliceren" are "-lire-ën", which also end with the sound /iren/.Although both endings contain
verbreiden, zijden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "verbreiden" ends with "-eiden", which has the same vowels ("i") and similar but not exactly matching consonant sound combination as compared to the ending of the other word, namely "zijden". The difference lies in their final consonantal parts (-dein vs -den). In rhyming analysis for languages like Dutch, this slight variation would still allow them to qualify as having some degree of similarity or near-rhyme between
bardeerde, embarkeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "bardeerde" and "embarkeerde" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their phonological structure. In rhyming languages like English (and many others), perfect rhymes typically involve final syllables with similar sound patterns in terms of vowels as well as following consonantal sequences that differ only minimally from each other [1].The last part of both words contains -ede which
joysticks, koelkamer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "joysticks", ends with the sound /ks/.* The second word, "koelkamer", also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /r/.Although they differ in their initial consonantal clusters ("ys" vs. "kl"), both end with the exact same final consonant-vowel-consonant combination (/s/, /er/) which meets the definition of rhyming according to traditional linguistic criteria
vlieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vlieren" and "begieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check whether they share similar ending sounds that consist of both vowels and consonants (identical V&Cs). In this case:* The word "vlieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /erən/.* The word "begieren" ends with "-gieren", which also has the
loopgravenstellingen, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "loop", "graven", "stelleningen" and "aanvijlen" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "loop" ends with the sound /p/* The word "graven" ends with the sound /n/* The word "stelleningen" ends with the sound /ngen/* The word "aanvijlen" ends with the sound /ln/As you can see, none of them share the same ending pattern
piepjongst, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongst" and "-orden-den" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (and many other languages), they need to share similar ending sounds that include both vowels and consecutive consonants ("identical vowel and consonant sounds"). The suffixes "-pong-" in "piepjongs" and "-den" in "-orderen" don't match perfectly because of their distinct phonetic properties: 1) "
rapieren, mortieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-eren" in both "rapieren" and "mortieren" has the same sound, which means they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming as per your request. The -r- and -t- at the end of each word may differ but their preceding vowels (-i and -o respectively) match exactly when spoken aloud, making them homophones with regards to their final syllables. Therefore, I conclude yes, they can be considered
seculieren, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "seculieren" and "pluvieren" end with "-eren", which means they share similar ending patterns, including their vowels ("-ueren"). The difference lies in their initial consonant clusters: "/s/" (in "seculieren") versus "/p/" (in "pluvieren"), fulfilling one of the criteria for rhyming words to differ only after the shared vowel sound. Therefore, according to this criterion, yes,
ontsieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Here's why:The two words "ontsieren" (to rent out) and "schapuleren" (a verb that doesn't exist in the dictionary, but I assume you meant to ask about another word like "schuilplaatsen", which means "hiding places") both end with "-eren".In order for them to rhyme according to your criteria of having different consonants before equal vowels and final consonents, we need to check if they share similar
voertjes, snoertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voertjes" and "snoertjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In Dutch linguistics, rhyming is determined by the presence of similar or identical phonemes (sounds) at the end of two words. In this case, both "voertjes" and "snoertjes" end with the "-tjes" suffix, which consists of the same vowels (-e-) and distinct but repeated consonantal sounds (/r/, /n
dolfijntjes, strapontijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "dolfijntjes" and "strapontijntjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-tjes", which is a common suffix in Dutch indicating small or diminutive forms.* The vowels preceding this suffix ("i" in both cases) remain unchanged.* Although there's no exact identity between their initial consonantal clusters (the combination of letters before the first vowel), they share similar sound patterns: /dlf�
psalmodierend, prejudicierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psalmodyerend" and "prejudicerend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming (having same ending sound), we need to analyze their suffixes (-ending). The key is that they should share the exact sequence of vowels and consonants at the end.1. Pslmodyrənd: It ends with -dye-rən-d2. Prejyd�
ontduik, invallen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontduik" and "invallen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables' phonetic composition. The word "ontduik" ends with "-uik", which contains the vowel sound /ɪk/. On the other hand, the word "invallen" concludes with "-llen", featuring the vowels /æl/.As they possess distinct combinations of consonants (
aanvijl, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "aanvijl" ends with the sound "-il".* The word "esthetic" (note: I assume you meant to write this in English, not Dutch) has its own pronunciation in English, but if we consider only the ending part ("tic"), then it also ends with the similar sound "-ic".In both cases, there's no change of vowels between them; they end with distinct consonantal sounds (-il vs -ic
scharnieren, slieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "scharnier" ends with the sound "-ernier", which has the vowels "er" (a diphthong) and the final consonant "/r".* The word "slieren" also ends with the sound "-eren", again having the same combination of vowels ("e") and the final consonant "/rn".Since both words share similar ending patterns, specifically in terms of their vowel-consonant combinations (/er
schapulieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "schapulieren" (-ieren) has a unique combination of vowel (i/e/) and following consonant(s) (/n/, /r/), which matches with the same pattern in "staffieren". The rhyming criteria you specified, having different consonants preceded by identical vowel and consonant sounds, is fulfilled here as both words end with -iereN where N represents distinct consonantal combinations. In this case:- Schap
wegdruip, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "wegdruip" and "onneembaarder" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires:1. Different initial consonantal sound(s)2. Identical final vowels3. Identical subsequent consonental sounds (if any)In this case:- The first word ends with "-druip", where '-p' meets condition 3.- The second word ends with "-enneembare-r".
tierelieren, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "tierelieren" ends with the sound "-eren".* The second word "slamieren" also ends with the same sound "-eren".Since both words end with the same vowel-consonant combination, they do not technically rhyme in English or many other languages where rhyming typically involves having similar but distinct final syllables (consonant-vowel pairs). However, from a phonological perspective within the context of the Dutch
ordenden, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ordenden" and "aanvrijn" (not "aannvijl") do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check whether they end with the same combination of vowels and consonants. The last three letters in both words ("den", "ijn") seem similar at first glance, but upon closer inspection, you can see that there is no exact match between their ending combinations:* In "
distantierend, renvooierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "distantierend" ends with the sound "-erend", which consists of the letter combination "nd".* "renvooierend" also ends with the same sound, namely "-erend".Although they share similar endings ("-erend"), their final letters differ: one has "n-d" while the other has simply "r". According to traditional phonological rules in many languages (including English), this difference would make them non
scharnieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "schar" in "scharnieren" ends with the sound /rn/* And so does "best-" in "bestieren", which becomes "-steren"Both endings ("-rnen" and "-steren") follow this pattern: same vowels, but different consonants (/r/ vs./st/, respectively). This meets the criteria for rhyming in many languages, including English and Germanic tongues like Dutch. Therefore
provenierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "provenierend" ends with the sound "-en-d".* The word "solfegierend" also ends with the same sound sequence, namely "-er-en-d".Since they share the same ending (-erd) which includes both vowels ("e") and consonants (the final nasal stop), we can conclude that indeed they do rhyme according to traditional rhyming criteria in many languages including English and French, where similar rules
wegdruip, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "wegdruip" and "ontroomt" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-up", which is where their rhyming begins.	+ In both cases, there's no change in the vowels ("i" or "o") when moving from one word to another (homogeneous).* Following this shared ending of -"up", they also share similar final consonantal sound /p/.    + This means that after removing
geaccapareerde, gepikeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "geaccapereerde" and "gepiekèrede" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar ending phonemes with regards to both vowels and consecutive consonants. In this case, although both words end with "-eerde", their preceding consonantal sequences differ: "g(e)ac-ca-pa-reer-de" vs. "g(e)pik-e
saffieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "saffiren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the same final syllable (-en) where both vowels ("e") and consonants ("r") match.* "brevieren" also ends with the sound "-eren".Since they share similar ending patterns, including matching vowel-consonant combinations (both end in -ern), we can conclude that these two Dutch words do indeed rhyme according to this criteria of having distinct initial conson
jut, trompetbomen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "jut" (t) and "trompetbomen" ("men") meet the criteria for rhyming in English, which requires:1. Different initial consonant(s)2. Identical final vowels3. Identical following consonant(s)In this case:- The first two letters "ju-" differ from "-tro-", meeting condition 1.- Both end with -T, satisfying conditions 2 &
jut, binnenstormde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the pair of Dutch words "jut" and "binnenstormde", we can observe that they do not share similar ending sounds, which is one characteristic criterion for rhyming in linguistics (specifically, having different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds).* The word "jut" ends with /t/, while "binnenstormde" ends with /dɛ/.* Although both words contain some form of -en or
etnisch, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch" and "voor-eind" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (or diphthongs). Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of both vowels and following consonantal sounds ("identical vowel and consonant sounds").The word "etnisch" ends with "-sch", which is pronounced as /ʃ/. The suffix "-eind" on
stipendierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "stipen-" in "stipendierend" ends with the sound /nd/.2. "-asf-" in "asyfixerend" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes, namely /s/, f/.Although they differ slightly due to diacritical marks (e.g., -i- vs. -y-, which can affect pronunciation), both endings contain similar combinations of vowels (/i/) and consonants
jut, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "gemeste" do not rhyme.Justification: In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar phonetic patterns at their end. This means that both words should conclude with distinct consonantal sounds preceded by matching vocalic components. In this case:- The word "jut" ends with /t/, which is a voiceless alveolar stop.- On the other hand, "
psalmodierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "psalm" ends with the sound /dɪər(ə)nd/, which consists of two distinct parts: -di- (the diphthong "i-e") and -ernd.2. Similarly, the word "distanteren" also has three syllables (-dis-tan-te-ren), where each part contributes to its overall pronunciation:   * dis-   * tan   * te
ontsieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontsieren" and "schareniren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In Dutch phonology, rhyming is determined by matching final syllables with similar sound patterns. In this case:* Both words end in "-ren", which indicates that they share the same ending.* The vowels preceding the shared suffixes ("-nt-" and "-ch-", respectively) differ only slightly: both contain distinct but similar sounds (the palatal nasal /ɲ
kohieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kohieren" and "manieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. In this case, both "kohieren" and "manieren" end with "-eren". This is where things get interesting!When looking at the ending of each word (-iren), notice that they share similar patterns: * Both start with the same consonantal sound (/r/)*
certifierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "certifieren" ends with the sound /nd/.* The word "solfegieren" also ends with the sound /nd/.Since they both end with the same sequence of phonemes (/n+d), which includes the vowels /eɪ/ in each case, we can conclude that they do not meet the criteria for rhyming according to your question (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). In
belichtingstechnicus, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "belich-" in both words share the same sound, which is /iː/* The ending "-ting" has distinct consonantal sounds: /ŋ/, /dʒ/, respectivelyTherefore, despite having similar vowels at the beginning of each word ("be-", not exactly matching but close), they meet the criteria for rhyming because their final consonental parts differ (identical-vowel-consonant-sounds).<|eot_id|>
bijstanders, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "bijstanders" ends with the sound "-anders", which has the same vowel ("a") and consonant ("-ndrs").* The word "voorig" (not "voorlig", I assume that's a typo) also ends with the sound "-ig".In both cases, we see that there are indeed differences in their final consonantal clusters (-ders vs -ig), but they share the same ending vowels ('and'-'
treknet, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "treknet" (-et) and "ontduik" (-uk) do not share the same ending sound, which means they meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different initial consonants but sharing the same final vowels (in this case, -eT and -uK). The distinctiveness of their endings ("t" vs. "k") fulfills the requirement for differing consonantal sounds preceding those shared vocal
palissadeerden, hybridiseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffix "-eer-den" appears in both "palisadeeren" (to surround with a fence or wall) and "hybrideeren" (to hybridize). In each word, this suffix has distinct consonantal sounds ("-l-" vs.-b-", respectively), but they share similar vowels ("-ee") at the end of their respective sequences. This meets the criteria for rhyming as described: having different initial consonants preceded by matching vowel-con
associeren, petrifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "associeren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the vowels "e" and the final consonant "n".* "petrifieren" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely "-eren".Since both words end with the exact same combination of vowel-consonant sounds ("-ere-n"), they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
perforeerden, trepaneerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "perforeeren" ends with the sound /rən/* "trepaneeren" also ends with the same sound /rən/Although they differ in their initial letters, both words share the same ending pattern of having different consonants (/p-/, `/t-/`) followed by the identical vowel-consonant combination (`/ən/`). This meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language.<|eot_id|>
zenuwpijn, beschietend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zenuw" in the word "zenuwpijn" ends with "-eu-" sound.* "beschieten-d" (the suffix of the second word) also has the same ending, which is "-eit-".Since they both end with similar vowel-consonant combinations ("-ei-", specifically), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to traditional rhyming criteria for Dutch language.<|eot_id|>
essayeren, marchanderen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "essayeren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the diphthong combination of /ɛr/.* "marchanderen" also ends with the same sound, "/-aren/", which again contains the similar sequence of vowels and consonents: /a/.Since both words end in the exact same phonetic pattern (/ɛr/) or (-ar), they technically do not meet the criteria for rhyming according
prejudicierend, intervenierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "prejudicierend" ends with the sound /nd/.* The word "intervenierend" also ends with the same sound /nd/.Since both words end with the same combination of vowels (/i/) and consonants (/nd/), they do not technically rhyme in the classical sense, which requires that only the final syllables (or parts thereof) share similar phonetic features, specifically differing initial consonants but matching
jageressen, delicatessen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jagerssen" and "delicatessen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending parts that contain vowels and following consonants. Rhyming requires matching of both vowel sound(s) and subsequent consonantal phonemes.The word "jagersen" ends with "-sēn", which has the same vowel sound (/eɪ/)
ontsieren, scholieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "ontsieren" ends with the sound "-iren".* The word "scholieren" also ends with the same sound, which is "-eren".Since they share the same ending (-er-), but not in their preceding consonantal parts ("nts-" vs. "schl-", respectively), we can conclude that indeed, according to the criteria you specified (different consonants preceded by identical vowels and consonant sounds), these two Dutch
kohieren, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kohieren" ends with the sound /ren/* "vlieren" also ends with the same sound /ren/Since they share the same ending, which consists of two syllables (-re) where both vowels ("e") match in quality (the so-called 'identical vowel' part), we can conclude that they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming according to traditional phonological rules governing word-final clusters like this one in
kerkerende, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "kerkerende" and "aanvijl" do not perfectly rhyme in the sense that they don't share exactly the same ending sound, but they come close enough to be considered rhyming in some contexts of poetry or songwriting. Here's why:* Both words end with "-en", which is a common suffix indicating possession (e.g., "mijn boek - my book") or present participle (-ing form) verb endings.* The
contrarierend, polemiserend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "contrarierend" ends with the sound "-er-end", which consists of two distinct parts: the consonant cluster "/r/" (or more specifically, /ʁ/) and the suffix "/nd/", both following the same vowels.* Similarly, the word "polemiserend" also ends with the sound "-er-end". Here too, we see a consonant cluster ("l-" or /ɫ/, depending on pronunciation
vliertjes, kwartiertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "vliert" ends with the sound "-iɛrt"* "kwa-" in "kwartier-" has no direct impact on rhyming, but we'll ignore this prefix for now* The suffixes "-tje"s at the end of both words don't affect the overall phonetic similarity either.* When focusing solely on the core parts ("vier-"/"wiet"), they share similar final sounds (-irt
psychoanalytici, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:In the provided pair of words, "psychoanalytic" (Dutch: psychonalytica) ends with "-ic", while "ordenen" means to ordain or govern in English. The last syllables (-c and -den respectively), meet the criteria for rhyming as they both end with distinct consonantal sound (/k/) followed by similar vocalic sound combination ("i-c"). Therefore, based on phonological similarity between their final segments, we
prejudicieren, supplieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "prejudicieren" and "supplieren" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* They both end with the suffix "-eren", which indicates they share similar ending patterns.* The vowels preceding the final consonents ("i" vs. "u") differ, fulfilling one of the conditions you mentioned (different consonants).* Finally, their last consonantal sounds ("-cier-" and "-pl-er-", respectively)
distantieren, disharmonieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "distantieren" ends with the sound /eren/	+ The final syllable has the vowels "e" and "r"* "disharmonieren" also ends with the sound /iren/    + Again, we see the same pattern of ending in "-iren"As per your question's criteria: having different consonants (in this case, "t-" vs. "s-") followed by identical vowel and consonant
overaccentuering, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "overaccentuering" ends with the sound /-ing/, which consists of the letters "-ng".* "nadook" also ends with the letter combination "/k", but not exactly identical to /"-ing"/ since they belong to different phonetic categories (nasalized stop vs. alveolar nasal). However, in terms of rhyming, we consider vowels and following consonants that share similar pronunciation patterns.	+ The final
slamieren, Batavieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "slamieren" and "Batavieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words "slamieren" and "Batavieren" rhyme in Dutch, we need to examine their ending parts where vowels (V) or diphthongs might appear along with one or more consonants (C). The rhyming criteria for Dutch is that they should share similar V-C patterns at the end of each word.Here's
rapieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rapieren" and "bestieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending sound patterns. Rhyming requires that both words end with similar phonemes - specifically, they should share the same final vowels and consecutive consonants (or diphthongs).Let's break down each word:1. Rapieren: The last three letters ("rien")
associeren, reconcilieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "associeren" and "reconcilieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending phonemes - specifically, whether they share similar patterns of consecutive vowels and consonants. 1. The word "associeren" ends with "-eren", which has a combination of /r/, /e/, and another silent letter.2. On the other
katalyseerden, gradeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "katalyseerden" and "gradeerden" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the suffix "-eren", which indicates that they share similar sound patterns.* The final syllables of both words ("-eerd-en") contain distinct consonantal sequences (the letters "r-d-n"), but follow them up with identical vowel-consonant combinations (-en).	+ In "katalyseerden", we see -
schaverdijntjes, harlekijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffix "-tjes" appears in both "schaverdijntjes" and "harlekijntjes", which indicates they share similar sound patterns at the end of each word. In particular, after removing this shared suffix (-tjes), we can analyze the remaining parts:* Schav-er-dijn -> /ʃaːvər ˈdiɲ/* Har-lek-iyn -> /hɑrl
harmonierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The last three letters of "harmonierend" are "-rend", which contain the sound /nd/.2. Similarly, the last four letters of "asfyxierend" are "-yxi-er-end", where we can identify two separate parts: "/xyi-" (with distinct consonantal sound) and "-er-end".3. When considering only the vowels in both words ("e" and "ie"), they do not
overlig, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "over" ends with the sound /r/* The word "sciopticon" (I assume you meant to type this instead of sciopticons, which doesn't seem like a valid English or Dutch term) ends with the sound /n/In rhyming in Dutch, what matters most is not just that two words end with the same letter, but also that they share similar phonetic qualities after that point. In
kielvlak, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the three-word phrase "kielvlak-ingestort" consists of two parts: "kielvlak-" (ending with -lak) and "-ingestort". * In both cases, we can see that there's no change in vowels ("i", "a") after the initial part.However, for rhyming to occur, at least one pair should share similar ending letters or diphthongs. Here:	+ The first word
handicaprace, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that "handicap" ends with the sound /ɑːs/, while "racer" (from "racE") has no ending, effectively making its last part silent or non-existent for rhyming purposes. On the other hand, both "- Voor-" parts in "voorraad" and "voorlichte" end with the same sequence of vowels and consonants: "/oʊər/" which can be considered as having identical vowel and
interlinierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "interlinierend" and "differentierend" both end with "-erend", which means they share similar sound patterns in their final syllables (-ent). The last three letters of each word ("-rent") match, indicating that they may indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified (differing only after the initial vowel-consonant combination).In phonetics terms:* Both words feature the diphthong /iː
passagieren, tierelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "passagieren" ends with the sound "-eren".2. The second word "tierelieren" also ends with the same sound "-ieren".Although they share similar endings, since the preceding consonants differ ("ss-" vs. ""), we can conclude that indeed the two words do not exactly rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in their ending parts (-iren).<|eot_id|>
voorlegt, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the final syllables "-egt" in "voorlegt" (voor-leg-t) and "-ekken" in "ontdekk-en" both end with the same sound, which can be represented as /ɛkt/. The difference lies only in their initial consonantal clusters: "vr-" versus "nt-", respectively. This meets one of the criteria for rhyming in Dutch poetry, namely having different consonants preceding identical vowels and ending consonents
kopieren, associeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "kopieren" ends with the sound "-eren".* The word "associeren" also ends with the same sound, which means they both share similar ending patterns.* However, when we examine their endings more closely:	+ In "kopieren", the final two letters are "ren".	+ In "associeren", the final three letters are "sier".Although both end in what appears to be a silent "e"
verbreiden, verweidden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "verbreiden" ends with the sound /nɪdən/	+ The final sequence of letters "-brei-" represents the phoneme /briː/, which includes the vowel sound /ɛ/.* "verweidden" ends with the sound /vɛrwaɪdn/Since both words end in different consonantal sequences, but share the same vowel sound (/ɛ/) at their respective endings
piepjongst, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piep", "jong" and "bedrijf-" do not rhyme according to the traditional definition of rhyming in linguistics.In order for two or more words to rhyme, they should have exactly same ending sound (phoneme) regardless of their meanings. In this case:* The word "piep" ends with "-ep"* The word "jong" ends with "-oŋg"* And the word "bedrijv-ing"
planimetreer, beschietend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "planimetrie" (not exactly spelled as you provided) and "beschietennd" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "planimeteren" has three syllables: pla-ni-me-treeren.	+ In its last part "-treuren", we see the sound combination /tr/, which is unique to this suffix in the language.* On the other hand, the supposed second word "beschiëtennd" seems
perforeerden, mythologiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "perforeerden" ends with the sound "-eren"	+ The final two letters (-en) represent distinct consonantal sounds (/n/)	+ No other vowels appear before or after this sequence* "mythologiseerde" also ends with the sound "-ereed"-eertse-    + This suffix ("-eerde") represents a distinctive pattern of identical vowel-consonant combinations, where -ee- corresponds to /i
desavoueren, essayeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "desavoueren" and "essayeren" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if they rhyme or not, we need to check their ending sound patterns. The word "desavoueren" ends with "-ren", which has the same vowels (-ou) but distinct consonants (v vs s). On the other hand, "essayeren" also ends in "-ren", having similar endings despite being pronounced differently due to differences between's'
duif, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "duif" (DOO-ief) and "tas-won-ing" (TAS-soo-wing) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:1. They both end with distinct consonantal sounds: /f/ and /ng/, respectively.2. The vowels preceding those consonants, namely 'i' (/ɪ/) and '-oo-', share similar phonetic qualities as they're pronounced similarly within their respective d
spuitjes, schuitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "spuit" ends with the sound /tjɛs/* "schui-" (from schuitje) ends with the same diphthong /u.j/Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination (/uj/) despite having different initial consonants, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the typical definition of rhyming in languages like English or Germanic languages where this type of analysis applies
jut, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "-zetterijen" do not rhyme.Justification: In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or don't rhyme, we need to analyze their phonetic structure. Rhyming requires that both words end with similar sound patterns consisting of vowels and consonants.In this case:* The word "jut" ends with /t/, which is a single consonantal sound.* On the other hand
beschietend, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "beschieten" and "trompetboom" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to check their ending sound patterns. The word "beschieten" ends with "-ten", which has distinct consonantal sounds /tn/. On the other hand, the word "trompetboom" ends with "-oom". This suffix combination contains unique phonetic elements as well (/m/, /o/) that differ
verlichtten, regimentscommandant, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "verlichtten" ends with the sound /nɛntən/.* The word "regimentscommandant" ends with the sound /mændɑ̃t/.Although they don't appear to share any obvious similarities, upon closer inspection, we can see that both ending sounds contain the same vowels (/e/, /a/) and distinct consonantal components (the nasal /n/ in one case and the labial
harmonierend, prejudicierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "harmonierend" ends with the sound "-erend", which consists of the vowels "e" and the consonant "r".* The word "prejudicierend" also ends with the sound "-erend", consisting of the same vowels ("e") and consonant ("r").Since both words share the same ending pattern, they can be considered to rhyme according to the criteria you mentioned (different consonants followed by
discussieren, disharmonieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "discusseren" and "disharmoniseren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending parts, specifically focusing on vowels and following consonants. Rhyming requires that both words share similar phonetic patterns at this point.* The word "discussen" ends with "-sen", which consists of the letter combination "s-e-n".*
ritmeren, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the case of "ritmeren" (to rhythm) and "ontduiken" (to dive out), we can analyze their endings to determine if they rhyme:* The word "ritmeren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /rɛn/.* The word "ontduiken" ends with "-ijken", which also has the same ending sound /jək/.Accordingly, both words share similar vowels (-e-) in
abstinentieverschijnsel, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "abstinentie" ends with the sound /iː/2. The suffix "-schijn-" has no effect on the final syllable's phonology3. "sel" also ends with the same sound /ɛl/, which can represent the diphthong /eiʃən/4. Finally, "indeuk" ends with the sound /uːk/.As per your question about having
plantluis, rentetarieven, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "plant" ends with the sound /t/* "luis" also ends with the sound /s/, which doesn't match exactly, but in some languages like English or French, this could still count as rhyming due to similar endings.However, since we're considering Dutch specifically, I'll provide more detail:In Standard Dutch pronunciation rules (as specified by Het Nederlands Centrum voor Lexicologie), when two syllables end
piepjongst, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last three syllables "piej", "jong", and "navoen" all end with the same sound combination: "-ij". This meets one of the criteria for rhyming in many languages, including English (although not exclusively). The presence or absence of initial consonants ("p-", "n-") does not affect this similarity in final vowels and following consonants (-ij), which suggests they can indeed form rhymes according to common linguistic standards.<|eot_id|>
attentie, rotacisme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "attentie" ends with the sound "-tie", which has the vowels "i" and the consonant "t".* "rotacisme" ends with the sound "-seme", which also has the same vowel ("e") and consonant combination ("m").Since they both end with distinct consonant-vowel pairs, but share the same final vowel-consonant sequence (-ie/-eme), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme
zenuwpijn, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "bekwaamden" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar ending phonemes with respect to both vowels and consonants. The last syllables of each word should contain distinct combinations of letters that produce unique sound patterns when pronounced together.1. In "zenuwpijn", we see "-ijn" as its final part.2
gefortuneerden, gerendeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "gefortuurenden" and "gerealiseerdendragerenden" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "gefortunedien" ends with "-dienen", which has the sound /iːn/.* The word "gereindeerenedreinieren" (Note: I assume this is what you meant to write) ends with "-dragen", which also contains the same vowels as well as similar consonantal
blesseerden, palissadeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "blesseerden" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the vowels "ee" and the final consonantal sound "/r/".* "palissadeerden" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely "-een" (vowels) + "/d/", where "/n" becomes silent before another consonant in this case "/d/.Since both words end with distinct consonants ("-ren" vs.-"-
embarkeerde, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "embarkeerde" and "getraanseerde" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar ending sounds that include both vowels and following consonants. The key is whether or not there's at least one matching pair of identical letters among those last syllables.Upon examining the provided terms,* "Embarkeerde" ends with "-erde", which has unique letter
gebanderolleerde, geaggregeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:To determine if the two Dutch words "gebanderolleerd" and "geaggeregerd" (note: I assume you meant to type "gebanderolleerede-" instead of "-reerreede-", as that's how they would appear in their correct forms) indeed rhyme, we need to analyze their ending parts carefully.The last part of each word is:1. -elleerd2. -egregedIn both cases, there
veranderingsmogelijkheden, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two Dutch phrases "veranderingen" (meaning "changes") from the first part of the word, and "zenuwpijn" (meaning "nerve pain"), contain similar sounding vowels ("ing"-ending) but with distinct starting consonants: "v-" in "verandingen", vs. "zn-" in "zenuwpijn". This meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language where differing initial consonants precede matching vocalic endings
joysticks, kerkerende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "joystick" (Dutch: joystick) and "kerkerend(e)" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is "-ke". This means that they meet one of the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as described above ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds").However, please note that there might still be differences between their pronunciation or intonation when spoken aloud, but from a written perspective, based on spelling alone
janplezieren, portieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "jan" ends with the sound /n/* "plezi-" (part of "plezieren") ends with the diphthong /erɪər/* The second word, "-porti-", also has the same ending pattern: /ri/As you can see, although there's no exact match in spelling between the two endings (-ern vs -ri), their phonetic values differ only slightly due to the presence or
tensie, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tensie" ends with "-sie", which has the same vowel sound ("i") as well as similar consonantal ending ("-s"). Similarly, the word "blauwbekkend" also ends with a suffix "-bekkend". The last part of this word can be broken down into two parts: "bek-" (with no distinct vowel) + "-nd" (ending in nasalized consonant). Although not exactly matching due to
spalieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spalieren" and "bestieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In both words, we can identify similar patterns of sound repetition:- The ending "-eren" in each word has distinct consonantal sounds (/r/) preceding identical vowels ("e") which also share the same following consonantal sounds.This is precisely what defines rhyming in languages like Dutch: having dissimilar initial consonants but matching subsequent vocalic-consonantic combinations (CVCC pattern
zwijntjes, kwatrijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "zwijntjes", ends with the sound /tjez/.* The second word, "kwatrijntjes", also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /triz/.Since they share the same ending pattern (/tz), which includes both vowels (i) and consonants (z/t/r), we can conclude that indeed, they do rhyme according to the definition provided in your question. In this case, their
contravenierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "contraveneren" ends with the sound /nd/* "asfyzeren" ends with the same sound /nd/Although they don't seem to match exactly, in Dutch phonology, the sequence of vowels can also influence whether two words are considered rhyming or not. In this case, both words end with the diphthong "er-en", which means that despite having slightly different initial consonantal sounds (/ktr
jut, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "ontduik" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "jut" ends with the sound /t/, while "ontduik" ends with the digraph "quk", which has a distinct combination of consonantal and vocalic sounds that differ from those in "jut". Therefore, they don't meet the criteria for rhyming, as required in traditional linguistic analysis. In general, to qualify as rhymes in
wegdruip, deeltijdbanen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two phrases "wegdruip" and "deeltijd-baan-en" can be broken down into their constituent parts:* WEGDRIJP: weg (different initial consonant, /w/) + drijp (identical vowels /i/, same final consonant sound /p/)* DEELTIJD-BAAN-EN: deel-tijd (same prefix "deel", differing middle syllable "-tijd"/"-ba-",
verlichtten, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* "verlichtten" ends with the sound /n/* "aanvijlen" also ends with the same sound /n/The two words share the same ending, which is "-itten", where both letters ("t" and "n") form part of this suffix in Dutch grammar. This means that they do not meet the criteria for rhyming as per your question (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). Therefore, my answer
zenuwpijn, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "zenuwpijn" ends with the sound /nʊpɪyn/, which consists of the vowels "/o/" and "/i/", and the consonant cluster "/np".* The word "zuursel" also ends with the sound /səl, selsəl/, which again contains the same vowel combination "/e/" and "/a", but this time in a slightly more complex pattern.* Although
dienstroosters, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "dienstroosters" and "ontduiken" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check whether they share similar phonetic patterns in their final syllables. The key characteristic of rhyming is that both words should end with distinct consonantal sequences preceded by matching vowels (and possibly additional consonants).The word "dienstroosters" ends with "-sters", which has the
ontroomt, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontroomt" and "schreeuwerige" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming (also known as having the same ending sound), we need to examine their suffixes (-nt-roomt- vs -er-i-g-e). The key characteristic of rhymer is that they share similar vowels and following consonant patterns. Here's why I conclude that they don't meet this criteria:1
zuursel, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:In the pair of words "zuursel" and "ontduik", we can identify that they do not exactly follow the traditional rhyming pattern in English, where two words typically share similar ending sounds (consonant-vowel-consonant or CVC). However, if we examine each word individually:* "zuursel": ends with -sel	+ The final sound is /sɛl/* "ontduik": ends with
etnisch, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "etnisch" and "invullen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words "etnisch" and "invullen" rhyme in Dutch, we need to examine their final syllables. The last three letters of each word ("-sch", "-vull") differ from one another. In rhyming pairs, typically there is a matching sequence or combination of vowels (and sometimes also consonants) that appear at the
etnisch, kolendampvergiftiging, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "etnisch" and "kolendampvergiftiging" do not perfectly rhyme in the sense that they don't share exactly the same ending sound, but rather similar ones with slight variations.In phonetics terms:* The word "etnisch" ends with /sɪʃ/, which is pronounced as [ish] (the 'ch' being palatalized)* The word "kolendampvergiftiging" ends with -
Jut, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "jut" ends with the sound /t/, while "kreupel", "bos-", and "-sen" all end with the diphthong /uːpəl/. Since they do not share the same final consonant or ending, but instead differ in their last two phonemes (/-tl/-), we can conclude that "Jut-" does indeed rhyme with "Kreupel-boss-en". In other words, this
geadministreerde, gebanderolleerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "geadministreerde" and "gebanderolleerd" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they both end with "-eerde", which means that their final syllables share not only the same vowels but also similar or identical consonantal endings (the suffixes -ere and -ede). This is typical of many perfect rhymes in Dutch poetry and song lyrics. In linguistics terms, this phenomenon can be described using
diere, slamieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "diere" and "slamieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar ending sounds that include both vowels and following consonants ("identical vowel and consonant sounds"). The last syllables of each word should match phonetically: e.g., "-ate", "-ite", etc.).The final parts of "diere" (-ire) and "slamieren
spieren, slieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spieren" and "slieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (i.e., -inen and -eren). In rhyming words in Dutch, the last consonantal sound is crucial for determining whether they share similar phonetic properties or not. The word "spieren" ends with "-ienen", which has a distinct set of consonantal sounds (-n
distingeerden, proletariseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "distingeerden" ends with the sound "-eer-den", which has distinct consonant ("r") and vowel-consonant combinations.* "proletariseerden" also ends with the same sound, "-ee-r-den".Since both words share similar ending patterns (-een-), they can be considered rhyming in terms of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (different initial consonants but matching -
spieren, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spieren" and "pluvieren" do not rhyme.Justification: In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to examine their phonetic composition at the end of each word. Rhyming typically occurs when both words share similar ending patterns consisting of distinct consonantal parts accompanied by matching vocalic segments. In this case:* The final syllable of "spieren" is -eren with the
duivelsklauwen, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "duivels" ends with the sound /s/* "-klau-" has no effect on rhyming, since they're part of a single syllable* The final -en in "duivelsklauwen" makes its last two letters (w-en) form a digraph that doesn't affect the pronunciation or contribute to the ending's distinctiveness.* On the other hand, "voorli-g" end with
regimentscommandant, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "regiment" ends with the sound /nt/.* The second word "commandant" also ends with the sound /nt/.* Both words end in -ent, which indicates that they share similar ending patterns.* However, when we look at their preceding vowels ("i-" vs "-om-"), there's no similarity between them.* Therefore, according to the definition of rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel
schreeuweriger, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "schreeuweriger" (-er) and "-aanvijl" (il) do not share similar consonantal sounds, which indicates they don't form rhyming pairs in this case. The -r sound at the end of "schreeuweriger" differs from the il-consonance combination ending with "-aanvijl". In phonetics, distinct vowels or diphthongs accompanied by disparate final conson
bedrijving, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "bedrijven" ends with the sound /ing/* The word "aanwijlen" also ends with the same sound /ling/Since they both end with the same diphthong (a combination of vowels) and following consonant, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified: having different consonants but ending in identical vowel-consonant combinations (/iŋ/).<|eot_id|>
attentie, zuursel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "attentie" ends with the sound /iː/.* The second word "zuursel" also ends with the same sound /iː/.Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination, which in this case is "/-iːl/", we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition of rhyming provided (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds
belichtingstechnicus, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "belichtingstechnicus" ends with the sound /sɪk/.2. The word "detacheer" also ends with the same sound, which is /r/.Although they may not seem to share similar endings at first glance (one has a voiceless alveolar fricative [/s] while the other has a voiced alveolar stop plus liquid combination[/dr]), both end in a sequence of
gecollecteerde, embarkeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "gecollecteerd" ends with the sound "-erteer'd".2. The second word "embarkeerd" also ends with the same pattern, specifically "-ardeed".Since both words end in similar patterns (different consonants + identical vowels), they can be considered to rhyme according to this definition of rhyming.<|eot_id|>
kruisbessestruiken, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "kruis" ends with the sound /sɪz/.* The word "bessetruiken" has multiple parts, but one of them ("bess") ends with the sound /əz/. * Another part ("truien") also ends with the same sound (/rʏn/) which can approximate to /uz/, considering phonetic variations.* Finally, we need to check if they share the last two
plantluis, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "plant" ends with the sound /nt/* "luis" ends with the sound /lzɪs/)* Both pairs of letters ("lt", "nz") follow the same vowels, which in this case are both silent (the letter combination "pl" doesn't form a distinct phoneme), but they also end with different consonantal sounds (/t/, /z/) respectively.* Therefore, according to the definition you provided, "
zenuwpijn, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zenuw" ends with the sound /uw/* "pijn" also ends with the same sound /ujn/, which can be simplified to /ijhn/> (since in English, we would pronounce this combination of letters more like 'ih-n' than separate vowels)* Both pairs ("u"-"i/jh", respectively) meet the criteria for rhyming: they share similar or identical vowel and following consonant combinations.
Jut, interimaat, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "interimaat" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhymed, we need to examine their final syllables' ending patterns of vowels (V) and consonants (C). The term "rhyme" refers to when both words share similar V-C-V or C-V combinations at their ends. In this case,* "Jut" has -ut as its suffix.* "Inter
spolierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "spolieren" ends with the sound /nd/.* The word "asfyxieerenden" (note: I assume this should read "asfyxierende", which means "-ing form of 'to suffocate'") also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely /d/.According to the rules for rhyming in Dutch, two words can be considered to rhyme if they end with different consonants but
salarierend, europeaniserend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "salarierend" and "europeaniserend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonetic structure. In rhyming, what matters is that both words end with identical vowels (A) and consonants (/nd/) in this case."salarierend": The word ends with -er-end which has /r/, /n/, and /d/."Europeaniser
bijstanders, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the pair of words "bijstanders" and "esthetica", we can observe that they do not share similar ending vowels or final syllables, which is one key characteristic in determining rhyming patterns. The word "bijstanders" ends with "-ders" (a diphthong), whereas "esthetica" concludes with "-tica". This difference suggests that they don't meet the criteria for perfect rhymes according to the phonological pattern you
concilieren, rationaliseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "concilieren" and "rationaliseren" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "concilieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /ɛːrn/. The word "rationaliseren" also ends with "-eren", but its final syllable is pronounced as /raʃənɪzeˈrěn/, where the stress falls on the second part of the suffix ("-ise
tieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tieren" ends with the sound /nɪər/ (the combination of the letters -ien), while the word "manieren" also ends with the same diphthongal sound /mæniːʔɛrn/. The final consonantal sequence (-nr) in both words differs, but their last syllable's phonetic value matches due to the shared vowel-consonant pattern (/i/, then either /
ontruimt, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "ontruimt" ends with the sound /nt/.2. The word "registratie-rechten" can be broken down into two parts:    - "registratie" ends with the sound /ie/   - "rechte-" (part of "rechterten") also has a silent 'h' before "-te", so this part would end with the same sound /e/Since both ending combinations differ in
jut, kreupelbossen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "jut" and "kreupelbossen" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires:1. Different initial consonants: The first letters of both words ("J" vs. no letter) differ.2. Identical final vowels: Both words end with "-t".3. Identical following consonant(s): Although there's more than one word after the shared vowel sound (-t), this doesn't affect their r
linguisten, telefonisten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "linguisten" and "telefonisten" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to check their ending sound patterns. Rhyming typically occurs when both words end with similar phonetic sequences of vowels and consonants. In this case,* The word "linguisten" ends with "-sten", which has distinct consonantal sounds /tʃ/, /s
ontsieren, pieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "ontsiren" ends with the sound /nɪərəN/2. "pieren" also ends with the same sound sequence: /piːrəN/Although they don't share exact letters, their final syllables exhibit similar phonetic characteristics (different consonants but matching vowels/consonants). This meets the criteria for rhyming in many languages, including English. In this case, we can conclude
gereciproceerde, mythologiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "gereciproceerde" and "mythologiseerde" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they both end with "-ereede". This is because of their shared suffixes (-eciproc- / -logis-) which result in similar sound patterns at the ends (identical vowels and consecutive consonents). In linguistics terms, this phenomenon can be described as having perfect rime or complete identity between final
verlegd, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "verlegd" and "invullen" (not exactly equal to "invul", which is not a valid word in itself) do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with "-vd"	+ In "verlegd", the final sequence of phonemes /vəlɛktʰ/ has the sound "/vd/".	+ Similarly, in "invullen", the last part of its pronunciation /iːn
toereikend, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "toereikend" ends with the sound /nd/* "nadook" also ends with the same sound /nd/Since they both end with the same final consonantal sequence (/nd/) and the preceding vowels ("e", "a") produce similar or identical phonetic values, we can conclude that these two words do indeed share rhyming characteristics in terms of having distinct consonants followed by matching vowel-consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
jut, satansboleten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "juts", "satansbolen" (assuming this is how you meant to write "satanen boletten") can be broken down into their individual parts:* "juts": ju-ts, with distinct vowels ("u" and no-vowel) and ending in "-t"* "satansbol-" : sa-tan-bol-, also having separate sound components for each part* "-eten": -e-t-en
Jut, ingestort, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "jutting" has the sound /tɪŋstərt/, whereas "ingestort" (in its correct spelling, "ingedorst") is pronounced as /ɛnxdʒoːrst/. Although they share some similarities in their spellings ("-ting-" vs "-gest-", both ending with -T), the vowels preceding them differ significantly (/i~/ versus ~). Additionally, the following consonantal clusters vary greatly between
duif, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two Dutch words "duif" (meaning dove) and "verluchtten" do not exactly rhyme, but they share similar characteristics that make them close to rhyming in the context of Dutch phonology. Here's why:1. Both words end with -t: This is where their similarity starts.2. The vowels preceding the final -t differ slightly:	* In "duif", there's a closed front unrounded vowel [i] (like '
pionieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "pionieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /erɛn/, while the word "vieren" ends with "-iren", which also has the same ending sound /irɛn/. Although they don't share exact letters, their final vowels ("e") and following consonantal sounds ("-r-") match exactly in both cases, making them rhyming according to the criteria of having distinct initial consonants but sharing similar
kelderdeur, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kelder" ends with the sound /der/	+ The final letter combination "-er" indicates that this word has two distinct parts: "/ked-" (the root) + "-ler"* "deur" also ends with the same sound /der/, which matches exactly	+ This means both words share similar ending patterns, specifically in their vowels ("-e") and following consonant combinations ("-r")According to your request for rh
crisisteam, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "crisitream" (not found in dictionaries) and "zenuwpijn" do not exactly rhyme.Here's why:* The word "crisitREAM" is likely misspelled or non-existent; I'll assume you meant to type something else.* For comparison purposes, let's take another English-inspired example: "team" and "dream".	+ In rhyming terms:	- Both end with -EAM
pieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "pieren" ends with the sound /ən/.* The word "brevieren" also ends with the same sound /ərɛvʏˈrn/.Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequences, both words conclude with similar phonetic patterns: -en (identical vowel) + -r(n). This meets the criteria for rhyming words according to your request!<|eot_id|>
renvooieren, prejudicieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "renvooieren" ends with the sound /eren/.	+ It starts with two distinct consonants: 'r' (voiceless alveolar stop) and 'n'.	+ Then, there's the sequence of vowels: oo.	+ Finally, we see another set of consonants: iren (with double 'i', which doesn't affect the outcome).* Similarly, the second word "prejudic
kielvlak, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "kielvlak" and "evocerend" do not perfectly rhyme in the sense that they don't share similar final syllables with exact matching of vowels (e.g., -at, -et) or diphthongs (-oi, -au). However, if we focus on the last three letters ("lak", "rend"), which contain the core phonetic information for rhyming purposes:* Both end with a "-k
ontruimt, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "ontuimt" ends with the sound "-nt".2. It has the same vowel sound ("-i") before that.3. So, when compared to another word like "naduien", which also ends in the "-n-t" sequence,   they share similar phonetic characteristics (the combination of vowels and   consonants).In conclusion, based solely upon their ending letters (-nt), both words can be considered
Jut, liefdesgevoelens, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "liefdesgevoelens" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "jut" ends with the sound /t/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.* On the other hand, the compound noun "liefdesgevoelens" has multiple syllables: "lief-des-ge-voo-el-en-s". It can be broken down into smaller parts:	+ "lies-" (ending in
puitjes, jan-boerenfluitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "puit" ends with the sound /ij/* "jan" also ends with the sound /aj/* Both "boer-" and "-en-flu-it-je-s" end with the diphthong /uj/Since all of them share the same ending vowels (/i/, /a/) or similar combinations (diphthongs), they can be considered to rhyme according to traditional phonological rules in many languages, including English
kielvlak, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "kielvlak" (kaalk) and "kruis-besse-truik-en" ("truen") meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires different consonants to precede identical vowels and following consonants. In this case:* The final vowel sound /aːl/ in "kielvlak" matches with the diphthong-like combination "/ɪəs/" or
planimetreer, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "planimetree" and "voor-eind" can be broken down into their constituent parts to examine the rhyming criteria you mentioned: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.* The word "plani-met-reer" has three syllables:	+ Plani (different consonant, starts with P)	+ met (identical vowel sound, 'e')	+ reer (consonant cluster
jut, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut", "onneembaar" (unconquerable), and "-der" do not exactly rhyme in the classical sense of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.The word "jut" ends with the sound /t/, while "onneembaar" ends with the diphthong combination "/ɛr/" which is pronounced as a single unit. The suffix "-der" typically adds to nouns that end with vowels or
bankierend, slierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "bankierend" and "slieren-d" (note that the hyphenated word should read as separate entities) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:1. They both end with distinct consonantal sounds:	* Bankierend ends with "-nd"	* Slieren-d ends with "-d"2. Both pairs of words follow this pattern, where they share similar vowels but differ in their final consonantal sound (-
piepjongst, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "piep" ends with the sound /jɛptʃ/	+ The last two letters, "jp", form a single phoneme (a unit of sound) which represents this sound	+ This ending does not appear in either "jongst", "vader", or "vreugde"* Similarly,	+ "jongst" ends with the sound /t͡s/	+ It doesn't match any
kielvlak, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "planimeteren" (not exactly equal to your provided word) do rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with "-lak" in their respective forms.	+ In "kielvlak", we see that both letters ("k" and "l") form part of the final sound (-kl-).	+ Similarly, in "planimetren", after removing any inflectional endings or suffixes, you would
crisisteam, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "crisitsteam" and "taswoning" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending phonemes (sounds). The last part of each word is crucial in determining whether they share similar sounds or not.The word "crisitsteam" ends with "-team", which contains the sound /tɛm/. On the other hand, the word "taswoning" ends with
rentenieren, slieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "rentenieren" ends with the sound "-eren"	+ The final two letters ("er") form a diphthong, which means they're pronounced together	+ This diphthong has distinct vowels (/eɪ/) and consonantal sounds (the nasal /r/)* "slieren" also ends with the same sound "-eren"Since both words end with the exact same sequence of phonemes (-ere-),
lootjes, nootjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffix "-ijes" in both "lootjes" and "nootjes" has the same ending sound, which consists of two identical vowels (-oo- or -ee-) together with one final consonantal sound (the letter combination "-j"). This means they do indeed share similar phonetic characteristics at their ends, making them rhyming words according to traditional linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes. In this case, we can conclude that "lootjes
purifierend, prejudicierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "purifieren" (to purify) and "prejudiceren" (to prejudice) do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with "-eren", which is a common suffix in many Dutch verbs.* The final syllable of both words has a similar sound pattern: /-erən/. This means that they share the same ending phonemes (/r/, /eɪ/, and finally /n/) and therefore exhibit rh
omsingel, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the final syllables of both "omsingel" (om-SING-el) and "nadook" (na-DOOK) share similar ending patterns, which can indicate rhyming:* Both end with -eel in "omsingel", where "-e-" represents the same vowel sound.* Similarly, both end with -ooh or -uk in "nadook", also representing the same vowel-consonant combination ("oo" or "u
voorlichtte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorlichtte" and "nadook" do not rhyme.Justification:* In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhymed (or shared the same ending sound), we need to examine their final syllables.	+ The word "voorlichtte" ends with "-t-te", which has distinct vowels ("o") and consonants ("-tt").	+ On the other hand, the word "nadook" ends with only one letter combination
negotierend, petrifierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "negotierend" ends with the sound "-ernd", which consists of the vowels "e" and "i" (identical in this context) preceded by the consonant combination "tr".* The word "petrifierend" also ends with the same sequence: "-ernd", consisting of the identical vowel pair ("e") preceding the consonant combination "fr".Since both words end with the exact same final syll
ritmeren, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ritmeren" and "aanvijlen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming or having the same ending sound (also known as alliteration), we need to examine their final syllables carefully. The word "ritmeren" ends with "-eren", which has the letter combination of 'r' + 'e'. On the other hand, the word "aanvijlen" ends with
beneficieren, contrarieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "beneficieren" and "contrarieren" do not rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("eren") end with -iren suffixes.	+ In "beneficieren", the last two letters "-en-" make up one sound unit (/ɛn/) which is pronounced as /əˈnefisieʁan/.	+ Similarly in "contrarieren", the last three letters "-r-", "-", and
kielvlakken, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlakken" and "treknet" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In Dutch rhyming rules, two words can be considered to rhyme if they share the same ending sound (vowel + one or more consecutive consonants). In this case, both "kielvlakken" and "treknet" end with "-et", which meets the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language. The consonants preceding the shared -et
schapulieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "schapulieren" ends with the sound "-eren".* The word "plevieren" also ends with the same sound "-eren".Since they both end in the exact same sequence of vowels and consonants, namely "-eren", we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified: having different initial consonants but sharing the final vowel-consonant combination ("identical vowel and consonant sounds").<|eot_id|>
slamieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "slamieren" and "staffieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words end with "-eren", which indicates that they share similar phonological patterns.	+ In "slamieren," we find the sequence /lam-iren/, where "/l/" is a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (a type of stop) preceding the diphthongized vowels /iːr/.	+ Similarly
detacheer, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "detacheer" ends with "-eer", which has a double 'e' sound, while the suffix "-nadook" also contains two vowels ("o") in sequence. The presence of multiple consecutive vowels can affect how they interact phonetically, potentially making them appear to share similar or even identical sounds for rhyming purposes (in this case, both ending on /ɛər/). This phenomenon occurs commonly across languages where diphth
kielvlak, meridionaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word, "kielvlak", ends with the sound /klæk/.2. The second word, "meridionaal", also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /l/, then a silent 'n', then the diphthong "iə" (which can be approximated to [ɪʊ]), finally ending in the nasal consonant /l/.Although they do not share exact letters at
handicaprace, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "handicap" en "schreeuw-" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their phonetic composition:* The word "handicap" ends with the sound combination "-kap", which consists of /kɑp/.* On the other hand, the prefix "schreeuw-", when used as part of another word (like in this case), typically ends with the diphthong
jaartjes, bazaartjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "jaartjes", ends with the sound /tʃɛz/, which consists of a distinct consonantal cluster (/j/) followed by two vowels (/a/-/r-/) ending in a soft consonant sound (/z/).* Similarly, the second word, "bazaartjes" also ends with the same sequence: a distinct consonantal cluster (//) followed by three syllables (-/az-a
staffieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "staffieren" and "manieren" both end with the suffix "-eren", which indicates that they share similar phonetic endings, specifically /rən/. This is what defines rhyming in languages like English or German (and likely other Romance language families). Since their final syllables exhibit distinct consonantal sound differences (/f- vs -m/) but match on the following vowel-consonant combination (-ern), we can conclude that indeed, these two
duif, evocerend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "duif" ends with the sound /fɪv/ (the letter combination "uf") which has the same final syllable as "-evocerend", where the last two letters ("nd") make up the sound /nʤərənt/. Although they don't look similar, their pronunciation shares the same pattern of ending in distinct vowels (/i/) and following consonantal sounds (/f/, /j/, respectively). This meets
rotacisme, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "rotatie" (which means 'rotation' in English) ends with the sound /tse/. The suffix "-ismes" changes this to "/sismez". Then, adding the prefix "tre-" results in the final form "trésisme", which still retains the same ending sound as "rotacie".In contrast, when we add another syllable "-tenet" at the end of "rota-", changing its pronunciation into something like
smadelijkst, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "smadelijkst" and "ontroomt" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they share the same ending sound (in this case "-nt"). The final vowels ("ijkt" and "mt") also match exactly, as do their following consonantal sounds ("-kts" and ""). This meets the definition of perfect rhyme or exact rhyme in Dutch poetry and music.<|eot_id|>
bankierend, mierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "bank" ends with the sound /nd/* The suffix "-er-" has no effect on the pronunciation* "miren" (the verb) means to graze or feed, which in this context likely refers to grazing or feeding something that's not stationary ("mieren" would mean swarming)* So, when we add -d at the end of mire- (as part of the infinitive form), we get mier
negotierend, disharmonierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "negotierend" ends with the sound "-ernd", which has the same vowels (-ie) but distinct consonants (t, d).* Similarly, the word "disharmonierend" also ends with the sound "-rmdn", having the same vowels ("-i") again, but unique consonants (d, m).Since both words share similar vowel patterns ("-ie" in this case), they do not
diversifieren, distantieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "diversifieren" and "distantieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or share similar ending patterns, we need to examine their suffixes closely. Rhyming typically occurs when both words end with distinct consonantal sounds but identical vocalic sounds. In this case, let's analyze each word separately:1. Diversifieren: The last three letters of this verb
manieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffixes "-eren" in "saffieren" (to saffirize) and "-enen" in "manieren" (manners) both end with the same sound /en/. The final consonantal sound of each word (-ren, -nen) also matches, which indicates rhyming according to the phonological criteria you specified: having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and ending with similar consonental sounds. Therefore, I conclude that they
ontsieren, mortieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontsieren" and "mortieren" do rhyme.Justification:In Dutch phonology, rhyming is determined by the presence of similar vowel-consonant combinations (VCC) at the end of two or more words. In this case, both "ontsieren" and "mortieren" end with the VCC combination "-iren". The final letters 'n', 't' in each word differ but not significantly enough to disrupt their rhythmic
koelkamer, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "koel" ends with the sound /ləmɛr/	+ The final consonant phoneme is /L/	+ Followed by the same vowel phonemes: ɛ	+ And another consonant phoneme: R (which can also include some variation in pronunciation, but for simplicity's sake we'll consider them distinct)* "ontduik" ends with the sound /ˈʔɑ
indoken, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "indoken" ends with the sound /nəkɛn/, which consists of the letter combination "-ken". This is similar to how the suffix "-etika" in the word "esthetica" also has the same ending, specifically "/tɪka/. Since they both end with distinct vowel-consonant combinations (V-C), namely /en-kɛn/ for "indoken" and /i-tɪka/
psalmodierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "psalmodyerend" (pronounced as [ˈpʃɑlmoːdiərənt]) and "bediscussierend" (pronounced as [beˌdɪsjuːsi̯ərənd]) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* They both end with -en, which indicates they share similar suffixes.* The vowels preceding the
koelkamer, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two phrases "koelkamer" and "handicaprace" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "koelkamer" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of the letter combination "-er". The phrase "handicaprace", on the other hand, ends with the diphthong /ɑs/. This is because the letters in this case form a distinct phonetic unit that does not match the ending of "koelkamer".
piepjongste, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "piep" ends with the sound /jɛptʃ/2. "jongste" ends with the sound /tseːta/3. Both endings do not share any identical vowels or consonant sounds, so they meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language.4. Additionally, all three words ("piepjongste", "statica") end with distinct combinations of letters that don't match each other
negotierend, intervenierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "negotierend" and "intervenierend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. The word "negotierend" ends with "-erend", which has the diphthongal combination /ɛr/. On the other hand, the word "intervenierend" also ends in "-erend", but this time featuring
radende, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "radende" and "esthetică" do not exactly follow the traditional definition of rhyming, which is typically defined as having same ending sound(s) with differing initial letters (e.g., cat/hat). However, in linguistics, there can also exist near-rhymes or imperfect rhymes that share similar but not identical phonetic patterns at their ends. In this case:* The word "radende" has the diphth
abc'tjes, tweetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "abc'tjes" and "tweetjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In both words, we can identify distinct parts that contribute to their rhyming quality: 1. The suffix "-tjes", which is repeated in each word.2. The preceding syllables ("abc'") vs. ("tweet").The shared feature here lies within those suffixes ending with the same sound ("-tjes"). This similarity leads us to categorize them as having similar
asfyxierend, renvooierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "asfyxierend" and "renvooierend" both end with "-erend", which means they share similar endings (-identical vowels and consonants). The difference lies in their initial parts, where we can see distinct consonantal patterns: "a-" vs. "r-". This meets one of the key criteria for rhyming in many languages, including English (where this phenomenon is known as perfect rhymes or exact
piepjongste, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two syllables "piep" and "jongste", as well as "-jut", all end with distinct vowels ("iep", "oenge", and "u") followed by unique consonantal combinations, which satisfies the definition of rhyming in Dutch poetry (different consonants + same vowel sound). The phonetic representation would look like this:* "piepjongste": /piːpʲɣɔŋ
Jut, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "jut" and "bedrijven" do not exactly match in terms of rhyming, as the final sound "-t" is distinct from the combination of vowels and consonents "-ij-". However, if we consider only the last part of each word ("ut", "ijving"), they share similar sounds (-u-t and -i-j), which can be considered as having identical vowel-consonent combinations (identical VCCs).
brandverzekering, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "brand" (fire) and "-verzekering" (-insurance), as well as "-statica", all end with the suffixes "-nd-", "-zerking", and "-tica". These suffixes follow similar patterns in terms of their phonetic structure.Here's how they match:* The final sound for each word is /ing/, which consists of the same vowels (/i/) and consecutive nasalized consonantal sounds (/n/)	+ In both cases:
etnisch, ingestelde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch" and "-ingesteld-" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "etnisch" ends with the sound /sch/, which is represented by the letters SCH.* On the other hand, the suffix "-ingesteld-" has its own unique ending, specifically -LD-, where L represents a distinct consonantal phoneme (alveolar lateral approximant).Since they don't share similar endings (-SCH vs. -
katalyseerden, gereglementeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "katalyseeren" (to catalyze) and "gereglementeerd" (regulated) do not exactly rhyme.Here's why:* The last syllable of "katalyseeren" is "-reer-en", which ends with the sound /rɛn/.* The last two syllables of "gereglementeerd" are "-mente-ird", which end with the sound combination "/məntˈ
larderend, diskwalificerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "larderen" (to delay) and "diskwalificeren" (disqualify) do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "larderen" ends with "-daren", which has the sound /ɑːrən/.* The word "diskwalificeren" ends with "-fieren", which has the sound /fiˈreʏrn/.As you can see, although they both end in -
crisisteam, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "cris" in "crisistream" ends with the sound /sɪz/.2. "invul" in "invullen" (the correct spelling) also ends with the same diphthongal sound /vʊl/.Since they both end with distinct consonantal sounds (/s/, /t/) followed by similar but not exactly identical vowel-consonant combinations, we can conclude that "crisist
gerendeerden, gepikeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "gerendeerden" and "gepikeerdé" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires having different initial consonants but sharing similar ending vowels and final consonants (or lack thereof). In this case:* The first word ends with "-eerde-" (-r-, -e-, -n-) while* The second word also ends with "-ikeir-", where both sequences share the same vowel sound /
recipierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "recipierend" ends with the sound "-erend", which consists of the letter combination "-nd".* The word "distanterien"- (note: there seems to be a typo, I assume you meant "distantierend") also ends with the same sound "-rend", consisting again of the letters "-nd".Since they both end with the same diphthong ("-erend"), we can conclude that
affilieren, discussieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffix "-eren" appears at the end of both "affilieren" and "discussieren", which indicates they share similar phonological patterns. In particular, notice how:1. The final vowels in both words ("-en") match: /ɛrən/2. Both words contain distinct consonantal sequences preceding their shared -er ending:	* For "affilieren": /fɪlɪˈleʁ
kruisbessestruiken, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "kruis", "besseren" (note: I assume you meant to type "invullen"), "truken" all end with "-uis", which means they share similar ending sounds, specifically:* -u- as the common vowel sound* -s or -n as the final consonantal sound in each wordAccordingly, based on this similarity of phonetic patterns at their ends, we can conclude that these three Dutch words
attentie, pruimenboomgaarden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "attentie" and "pruimenboomgaard-en" (note: the suffix "-en" is not part of the main word, but I included it for completeness) can be analyzed as follows:- The last syllable in both words ends with -tie.- In each case, this ending consists of distinct consonantal elements (-nt-, -rm-) preceding vowels that share similar phonetic characteristics (/i:/).As such, they meet
composteerden, gradeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "composteren" and "graderen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme or not, we need to examine their phonetic composition at the end of each word. The suffix "-eren" is common in many Dutch verbs that indicate action (e.g., lezen - reading; werken - working). When comparing the ending sounds between "composteren" and "grade-reen", notice that they differ significantly
toereikend, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toereikend" and "esthetiek" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words in Dutch to rhyme, they need to end with similar or identical phonemes (sounds) that include both vowels and following consonants. In this case,* The word "toereikend" ends with "-nd", which is represented as /ɛnt/.* On the other hand, the word "esthetiek" ends with "-ek
traatjes, maatjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:In the pair of words "traatjes" and "maatjes", we can see that they both end with "-ajes". The vowels in each word ("a") sound alike, which means they share similar phonetic qualities (identical). However, the preceding consonantal clusters differ: "/tr/" vs. "/m/" respectively.This meets one half of the definition for rhyming, where two or more words have to finish off with the
slieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "slieren" and "bestieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhymed (i.e., share similar ending sound), we need to examine their final syllables carefully. In this case,* The word "slieren" ends with "-eren", which has the diphthong "eer".* The word "bestieren" also ends with "-eren", but contains the single-vowel sequence
joysticks, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joystick" (in this case referring to a type of joystick) and "vadervreugde(n)" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "joystick" ends with the sound /sticks/, which has the letters 'k' as its final consonant.* On the other hand, "vadervreugd(e/n)", being a compound noun in Dutch that roughly translates to "father's joy", is pronounced differently at its end.
joysticks, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "joystick" (Dutch pronunciation: [ˈjɔiʃtək]) and "-onneembaar-" ([oːnəmbar] or ["onuh-m-bar"]) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share similar ending vowels and differ only in their preceding consonantal sound(s). In this case:1. Identical vowel sound: Both end with the long-vowel sound
anjelieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "anjelieren" and "vieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is defined as having similar or identical final syllables with respect to their phonemes (distinctive units of sound). In this case:* Both words end in "-eren", which means they share the same ending.* The vowels preceding the -eren suffixes ("i" and "ie") differ only slightly, but still maintain the same quality and
reproducenten, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "reproducenten" ends with the sound "-enten".2. "indeuk" also ends with the same sound "-ek".Since both end with similar sounding suffixes, they do not meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language which requires distinct consonantal sequences before shared vowels/consonants (identical or nearly so). The correct analysis of this pair would classify them as near-rhymes rather than perfect homophones
duif, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "duif" ends with the sound /f/, while "nadui-ken" (the suffix "-ken" means 'little' or 'young') has two syllables: "nadi-" ending in /i:/, which then follows the consonantal sound /kən/. Since they do not share similar vowels nor final consonants (/f/ vs./kən/), we can conclude that their pronunciation does indeed differ at the end
binnenstroomden, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "binnenstroomden" ends with the sound "-en", which consists of two distinct parts: "/n/" (the nasal consonant) and "/ɛn/", where "/ɛ/" represents the schwa vowel.2. Similarly, the word "Joysticks" also has a suffix-like structure ending in "-s". When we analyze this further:   - "/ks/" represent consecutive consonantal phonemes that do
etnisch, veranderingsmogelijkheden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "etnisch" and "-veranderingen-mogelijkheid-en" do not exactly rhyme.Here's why:1. The word "etnisch" ends with -sch which is pronounced as /ʃ/, while in2. "-veranderingen-mogelijkheid-en" has multiple syllables that end differently:    * "-ring-" (pronounced as /rɪŋ/)	* "-lijk-heid-" (
zuursel, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* "zuur" ends with the sound /sel/, which consists of a distinct consonantal sound (/s/) followed by a diphthongic vowel combination (-u-) ending in another distinct consonental sound (/l/).* "-leg-" is also a word-ending that has its own unique phonetic properties, consisting of two separate consonantal sounds (/l/-and-/g/) flanking a single (but still distinguishable) vocalic component.* Since
Jut, ritmeren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "riteren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. The word "jut" ends with the sound /t/, while the verb "riteren" (which means "to write again") has its last syllable ending in -eren, which contains the diphthong "ee-r". Since both endings contain distinct vowels (/u/ vs./
sanctifierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "sanctifierend" and "bediscussierend" both end with "-endernd", which means they share similar ending patterns, specifically:* The same number of syllables (3)* Same sequence of vowels: -i-e-er-* Different initial letters but following the pattern:	+ Sanct-i-fie-r-end	+ Bed-is-cus-sie-rendThis meets the criteria for rhyming in
tieren, passagieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tieren" and "passagieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables for differences in both vowels and consecutive consonants (VC pattern). The word "tieren" ends with "-iren", which has distinct letters ("i" and "r"). On the other hand, the word "passagieren" concludes with "-gen". Although they share similar ending sounds (-en
gebanderolleerde, decimeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "geb" in "gebanderolleerde" ends with the sound /b/* The following vowels are "-and-", which can be considered to form one phonetic unit, ending with the diphthong "/aɪ/"* Then comes "-er", which contributes another set of consonantal sounds* In contrast,* "decim-" starts with the same sequence: "de"	+ "ci" forms part of this cluster
toerekent, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "toereken" and "-esthétieK" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words in Dutch to rhyme, they need to end with exactly the same sequence of vowels (including diphthongs) and consonants. The word "toerekent" ends with -ent while the suffix "-esthétieK" has no ending similar to that (-ek). Therefore, based on this definition of rhyming, we can
attentie, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "attentie" ends with the sound "-tie", which has the vowels /iː/ (long 'e') and the consonant(s) /t/.* The word "vergokte" also ends with the sound "-kte", which has the vowels /oʊ/ ('oh' or long 'u', depending on pronunciation in Dutch) and the consonant(s) /k/.Since they both end with
zenuwpijn, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:In the provided Dutch words "zenuwpijn" and "voorraad", we can analyze their rhyming characteristics as follows:1. The final syllables of both words contain distinct vowels ("ijn" in "zenuwpijn" vs. "-raa-" in "voorraad").2. Although they differ, both ending sequences consist only of one or more consonantal letters (the combinations 'ij' & '-rr-' respectively) accompanied
repliceren, sferen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "repliceren" ends with the sound /ren/.* The word "sferen" also ends with the same sound, which means they both end in -ern.* Since their final syllables (-ern) share similar phonetic characteristics (identical vowels and consonant sounds), we can conclude that these two Dutch words do indeed rhyme according to the definition of rhyming provided: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and
staffieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "staffieren" ends with the sound /n/.* The word "begieren" also ends with the sound /n/.Since they both end with the same consonantal ending (-rn), but not exactly matching, we can conclude that their final syllables do share similar vowel-consonant patterns (both -ern). This meets one of the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different consonants preceding identical vowels and consonant endings
konvooieren, gratieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that both "konvooieren" and "gratieren" end with the suffix "-eren", which indicates they share similar phonetic patterns, including:1. Different initial consonantal sounds: /k/ in "konvooieren" vs. /g/ in "gratieren"2. Identical vowels: Both words conclude with the same vowel sound "/ɛr/"3. Similar final consonantal sounds: The nasalized diphthong
gefortuneerden, geimplementeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "gefortuurenden" and "geïmplementeerd" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "gefortuurenden" ends with "-uren", which has the sound /ər/.* The word "geïmplementeerd" ends with "-menteerd", which also has the same ending sound.However, despite having similar endings (-uren vs -mentee-rd), they don't share exactly the
negotierend, atrofierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "negotierend" and "atrofierend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or share similar rhyming patterns, we need to examine their phonetic composition at the end of each word. In this case, let's break down both words into individual syllables with distinct parts: 1. Negotierend:   - nego- means 'to negotiate'
jatte, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "jatte" and "sciopticonS" (note the plural form) do not exactly match in terms of their ending sound, as one is "-ate" ("-at") while the other ends with "-ons". In rhyming pairs, typically there should be similar or exact matching between vowels and following consonantal sounds for them to qualify as true rhymes.<|eot_id|>
gecollecteerde, hyperboliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "gecollecteerde" and "hyperbolizeerden" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* They both end with "-erde", which is a common suffix indicating past participle or passive voice.* The vowels preceding the -erte ending ("e" and "i") match, making them similar phonetically.* Although they differ in their initial consonants (g- vs h-, c-c), this difference does not affect the final syllable
liefdesgevoelens, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "liefdesgevoelens" ends with the sound "-els"* "taswoning" ends with the sound "-ing"Since they both end in different consonantal sequences (-ls vs -ng) but share similar vowels (both ending in the /ɛːʊən/) or silent letters (/s/, which doesn't affect pronunciation), according to the definition of rhyming, we can conclude that yes, indeed
zwijntjes, strapontijntjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "zwijntjes" ends with the sound "-tjɛstʃəs", which has the same vowels ("i") and consonantal ending ("-tsch").* The word "strapontijntjes" also ends with the sound "-tjin(t)jɛstʃəs", again having the same vowels ("i") and consonantal ending (-"-tsch").Since both words share similar phon
voorlig, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "voor" and "raden-de" can be analyzed as follows:* Voor ends with the sound /r/* Raden-de (note that "-de" is a suffix) ends with the diphthong "/ərdɛ/" which contains the same vowels (/e/) and consonants (/d/, /r,/) in sequence.According to the definition of rhyming provided ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant
plantluis, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last two syllables of both "plant-luis" (plɑntˈljʊs) and "ver-gokt-e" (vərˈɣoːktə) end with similar phonetic patterns, which can make them rhyming in some linguistic contexts:* "-uj-" sound in "luis"* "-tE" or "-TE" sound in "getoke"In general, if we
parasiterend, exclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "parasiteren" (to parasite) and "exclameren" (to exclaim) do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "parasiteren" ends with "-eren", which has a distinct sound of /rɛn/.* The word "exclameren" also ends with "-eren", but this time, it's pronounced as /ək'læmʏrn/. Although they share similar letters, their
kielvlak, toereikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the two sets of vowels in "kielvlak" (ie-oe) and "toereikend" (ee-ei) do not match, which means they don't meet the criteria for rhyming according to the definition you provided: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The ending sound /keilvlok/ has no matching counterpart with /reiken/. Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that "
piepjongste, etnisch, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "piep" ends with the sound /jɛptʃ/	+ The last three letters ("jp") form a single phoneme, which represents a distinct combination of consonantal sounds.	+ This sequence does not appear in any other word in this phrase to create rhyming conditions (different vowels or consonants).* Similarly for all subsequent pairs:	- "jongste": /tse/    - Not found elsewhere
masturbeerden, militariseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "masturbeerden" and "militariseerde" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables' phonetic characteristics. In rhyming words in Dutch, the last part of each word should contain distinct consonantal sounds (different letters) followed by similar or identical vowel-consonant combinations (-ee, -ie, etc.).In this case:* The ending "-eer-" in
crediterend, denoncerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two word endings "-endernd" in "crediterend" and "-enonc"-er-end" in "denoncerend" meet the criteria for rhyming:* Different consonants: The initial consonants differ, being "dri-" (tr- sound) vs. "de-", respectively.* Identical vowels: Both end with the same vowel sound "/ɛ/" or close to it (/eɪ/) which can be
Jut, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "Jut" and "handicaprace" do not perfectly rhyme in the classical sense of having exactly same ending sound, as they don't share similar endings ("-t" vs "-ace"). However, if we focus on their internal rhyming scheme (different consonants + identical vowel-consonant combination), both words end with the sequence "/ənt/" which is considered to form a near-rhyme or imperfect rhyme. In this context,
janplezieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-eren" in both "janplezieren" and "bestieren" has different initial consonants, but they share the same final vowels ("-er") and following consonants ("-n"). In phonetics, this pattern of differing initials with similar finals is known as perfect rhyming or exact rhyme (also called end-rhyme). The similarity between their endings makes them rhyming words according to the criteria you specified: having different consonants
ontduik, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "ontduiken" (to dive) ends with the sound /nətˈdʊɪkɛn/.* The suffix "-atica" comes from Latin, where it would form part of a noun ending in -ica.* When adding this to the end of "ontduiken", we get "statica".* Both words share the same final vowels ("-ika") but differ significantly in their preceding
pleviertjes, kiertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plevier(t)jes" and "kiert(jes)" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-ies", which indicates that they share similar sound patterns.* The suffix "-ies" is often used in Dutch to form diminutive nouns or plural forms of adjectives/nouns ending in -e (in this case).* When we examine each word individually:	+ "Pleivertjes" has the sequence /plɛ
psalmodieren, beneficieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "psalmooderen" (to psalm) and "beneficieren" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is typically defined as having similar or identical ending syllables with regard to their sound and phonetic value. In this case:* The word "psalamodieren" ends in "-dieren", which has a /r/, /iːnʝɛnt/.* On the other hand,
vaderschapsverlof, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "vaderschaps" ends with the sound /s/* "-schap-" has no effect on the final consonant or vowel* The suffixes "-verlof", "-jut" both end with the same sequence of vowels (-o-), but they differ in their following consonantal sounds (/f/, /t/)Therefore, according to the definition you provided (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds) we
duivelsklauw, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "duivel" ends with the sound "-s-əl", where "-" represents any number of consonants, and "ə" is a schwa (a neutral vowel).* "klauw" also ends with the same pattern: "-l".* Similarly, "tromp-" in "trompet" has no significant effect on our analysis.* The suffixes "-et-", which forms part of both "boom"-type
tussenklanken, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the suffix "-n" in "tussenklank-" (meaning 'interconsonantal sound' or 'linking sound') has a distinct pronunciation, whereas the prefix "nadoo-" comes from the verb "doen", which means to do/to make something happen. The final part of this word ("-k") changes its meaning when attached to other roots, making it difficult for me to provide more information without knowing what root it's coming from). However
quintolen, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "quintolen" and "indeuk" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their phonetic structure. In rhyming words in Dutch (and many other languages), typically consecutive syllables with distinct initial consonantal sound(s) precede vowels that share similar quality/sound and following consonental sound(s). The word "quintolen" ends with -en which has /n�
tieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tienen" ends with "-ien", which has the same vowels ("i") as well as similar consonantal sound (/n/) compared to the ending of another word like "bervier"-en, also having /v/, then "/r/", finally again /-ën/. These characteristics meet the criteria for rhyming in many languages including Dutch. In summary: The suffixes -ten and -eren share common features such as double letters (-
attentie, navel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "attentie" (attention) and "navel" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In rhyming in Dutch, one of the key criteria is that consecutive syllables should share similar ending phonemes or diphthongs. In this case:* Both "attentie" and "navel" end with the same sound /iː/, which can be considered as having identical vowel and consonant sounds.* The preceding consonantal sequences
voorlig, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Voorlig: the sound sequence is "oor-lig"2. Vadervreugde: the sound sequence is "a-der-rue-g-de"As you can see, both word combinations end with distinct vowels (o & e) but not necessarily consecutive ones. However, this does not mean they don't share similar patterns in their final syllables (-rig). This meets one of the criteria for rhyming in Dutch poetry -
asfyxieren, ambieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "asfyxieren" and "ambiren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming scheme (consonance), we need to compare their ending parts from where they share similar sound patterns. The last part of both words is "-eren", which contains vowels (-i) with corresponding consonantal suffixes ("n"). However, since they don't match exactly for all letters, specifically at the beginning ("-s-"
beschietend, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "beschieten" and "voorgelicht" do not exactly match in terms of their rhyming pattern, as they differ slightly:* The word "beschieten" ends with "-tenden", which has a distinct sound.* The word "voorgelicht" (note: this might actually mean something else; I assume you meant to type "voorgelegd") ends with "-geld".In order for them
Jut, kruisbessestruiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut", "kruis", "bessetruik"en all end with "-tu-" which is considered to form a rhyming sound in Dutch.Justification:In Dutch phonology, when two or more syllables (or parts of them) share similar ending sounds (-u-, -e-, etc.), they can be classified as having a perfect rhyme. In this case, we see that each word has the same suffixes: jut
welhebbende, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two given Dutch words "welhebbende" and "joysticks" do not perfectly match the definition of rhyming in Dutch, which typically requires that they end with the same sound (consonantal or vocalic) regardless of their spelling. However, if we focus on the final syllables:* The last three letters "-e-b-be-" in "welhebbende"* And the ending "-cks" in "joysticks"We
aanvijl, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "aanvijl" ends with the sound "-il", which consists of two distinct consonants ("i" and "L").* The word "esthetiek" also ends with the same sequence, namely "-ik".Since both words end with different consonants (not just duplicates) but share similar vowel-consonant combinations (-ie), they do not technically rhyme in the classical sense of having exactly matching final syllables. However,
tribunaaltjes, provinciaaltjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch phrases "tribunaaltjes" and "provinciaaltjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The suffix "-aaltje"s in both words share similar characteristics:	* Both end with the letter combination "-ltj", which is pronounced as /tʃəlts/.	* This ending sound (-lt) is typically preceded by vowels (in this case, -aa-).2. In general, when comparing rhyming pairs of
seksualiseerde, trasseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "seksualiseerde" ends with the sound "-eerde", which has the same vowels ("ee") and similar but not exactly matching consonants (both ending in -r, d).* The word "trassenredden" also ends with the sound "-eren", which again has the same vowels ("eere") and similarly structured consonants (-rr-, dd).Since they share both the vowel and consonant patterns at their
abstinentieverschijnsel, Jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the two Dutch words "abstinentieverschijn-sel" and "Jut" rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. The last three letters of "abstinentie-verschijn-sel" (-sel) consist of S-E-L, which represent distinct consonantal sounds (sibilant /z/, labial /l/, alveolar nasal /n/) preceded by identical vowels (/e/). Similarly, in
slieren, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "slieren" and "pionieren" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "slieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /ərɛn/, while "pionieren" ends with "-iren", having the sound /iːʁin/. Although both endings contain similar vowels (-e-), they differ in their final consonantal sounds (/r/ vs./n/). In Dutch phonology, rh
tierelierend, zwierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "tierelierend" and "zwierend" meet the criteria for rhyming in that they both end with "-erend", which is a suffix indicating action or state of being (e.g., wandelen - to walk, zwieren - to flutter). This shared ending results in similar final vowels (-ender) and subsequent consonantal sounds (/nd/) making them rhyming words according to their phonological structure.<|eot_id|>
janplezieren, scholieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "janplezieren" and "scholieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming, we need to examine their final syllables (the part of speech after the last stress). The rules for determining whether they rhyme involve comparing the phonetic similarity between those parts. In this case,* "Jan-ple-zier-en" ends with "-eren", which contains the sound combination /er/.* "
negerwijk, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "negerwijk" and "voorigh" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they both end with "-ig". In this case, despite having slightly differing initial consonantal sound ("g-" vs. no-consonant), their final syllable structure (-er-, -o-) is shared, which makes them technically rhyme according to standard phonological rules of Dutch language pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
duif, bedrijving, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "duif" and "bedrijving" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words "duif" and "bedrijving" rhyme in Dutch, we need to examine their final syllables (sounds). The word "duif" ends with the sound /ɛf/, while the word "bedrijving" ends with the sound /ŋ/. Since they don't share similar consonantal or vocalic endings (/d
crisisteam, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "crisitream" (not actually a word in Dutch) and "voorraad" do not rhyme.Justification:* In rhyming words, both syllables should end with the same sequence of phonemes (sounds). This includes vowels as well.	+ The first part ("crisit") ends with /tɛm/, which is unique to this combination    + The second part ("voorlaig", I assume you meant
piepjongst, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three syllables "jong-st", "-static-a" meet the criteria for rhyming in English, which requires:1. Different initial consonant(s)2. Identical vowels3. Same ending sound (consonantal or vocalic)In this case:* The first two letters ("j" and "s") differ.* Vowels (-o- and -i-) remain unchanged.* Consonantic endings ("-ng-" and
ontruimt, verlegd, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt" and "verlegd" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of similar or identical vowels (a/e/i/o/u) with distinct consecutive consonantal phonemes (/b/c/d/f/g/h/j/k/l/m/n/p/q/r/s/t/v/w/x/y/z).The word "ontruimt"
manieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "manieren" and "bestieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. Rhyming in Dutch requires that both words end with distinct consonantal sequences (the so-called 'consonantenclusters') immediately preceding identical vowels ('identieke klinkers'). In other words, they should share similar but non-identical consonantal patterns before ending with matching vowel sounds.
contrarierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "contrarierend" ends with the sound "-ernd".2. The word "bediscussierend" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely "-sernd".Since both words end with the same vowel ("e") and consonant ("r", "n"), they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch.<|eot_id|>
schuurtjes, kwetsuurtjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "schuurtjes" and "kwetsuurtjes" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires having different initial consonants (in this case, "s-" vs. "k-") but sharing similar ending vowels ("urts"-sound) with matching final consonant(s). In both cases, there's also a "-t"s sound at the end of each word, contributing to their similarity. This pattern fits within
kielvlak, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kiel" ends with the sound /lək/* "vlak" ends with the sound /lak/* "indeuk" ends with the sound /duːk/Since each word has different consonants (or combinations of letters that produce distinct phonetic values) preceding their respective vowel-consonant clusters (/lk/, /laɡ, /dʊk/) which differ from one another in terms of both quality
zenuwpijn, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "zenuw" ends with the sound /uw/2. "pijn" also ends with the same sound /iw/So, they do meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different initial consonants but ending with the same vowel-consonant combination (/uw/ vs /iw/, respectively).<|eot_id|>
gemeste, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word phrase "gemeste" (Dutch for "greatest") ends with the sound "-ete", which is made up of the vowels "e" and the following consonant "t". On the other hand, the word "sciopticons" doesn't exist in Dutch language or any known dictionary; however, assuming you meant to write something like "schoepensticsion" (a fictional combination), we can analyze its ending as well
zenuwpijn, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "zenuwpijn" ends with the sound "-ijn", which has the same vowel ("i") and consonant ("n").* The word "ontdekken" also ends with the sound "-ekke(n)", where "-e" can be considered equivalent to another instance of "i".* Since both ending patterns share the same vowels (both being variants of "i"), they do not meet the criteria for rhyming,
psychoanalytici, framepjes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "psychoanalytisch" (Dutch for 'psychological') and "framepjes" both end with the suffix "-ies". In this case, we need to examine their final syllables before comparing them. - The word "psychoanalytisch" ends in -isch + -ies = -iès.- On the other hand, "framepjes" also ends in -ijes.As you can see, they
rentenieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "rentenieren" ends with the sound /nɪərən/.* The word "brevieren" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /vɛriːʋərn/.As we can see, both words end with distinct consonantal sounds (/n/, /vr/) preceded by identical vowels (the diphthong "iə"). This meets the criteria for rhyming
irreguliere, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "irregulière" ends with the sound "-ère", which has the same vowel ("e") and final consonant combination ("-r").* "pionieren" also ends with the sound "-eren", again having the same vowel ("e") and final consonant combination ("-ren").Since they both end in similar patterns, but not exactly alike (-ré vs -erén), I conclude that they do indeed share some similarity in their ending sounds
statica, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "statica" (tica) and "blauwbekkend" (bekknd) both end with distinct vowel-consonant combinations: tica ends in -i-ka, while bekends ends in -ekn-. Since they do not share similar final consonant-vowel patterns (-ika vs. -ekn), we can conclude that they don't technically rhyme according to traditional phonological criteria for rhyming in English
scharnieren, anjelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "scharnieren", ends with the sound /erɛn/.* The second word, "anjeliereren" (note: I assume this should read "anjelenier-en"), ends with the sound /irɛn/.Both endings consist of different consonants (/r/, /l/) preceded by the same vowels ("e") and ending in the -ern suffixes, which meet the criteria for rhym
jatten, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "jatten" and "wegdruip" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they both end with "-ten" which is considered to share similar sound patterns (different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds). In this case, despite having distinct meanings ("to catch mice" vs. "drainage"), their ending suffixes (-aten/-en) follow the same phonetic pattern of /tən
etnisch, kwintalen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "etnisch" ends with the sound /ɪʃ/* "kwintalen" ends with the sound /ələn/These two word endings do not share any identical vowels or consonants, therefore they meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (different ending sounds). The difference lies mainly in their final syllable's phonetic composition (/ɪ�
zondagssluiting, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zondags" in the word "zondagssluiting" ends with "-dags", which has the sound /ds/.* The same syllable in the second word, "trompetboom", also contains "/-et/".	+ Since they both end with similar patterns (-ds/-et), we can conclude that their final vowels (both 'a') share identical phonetic characteristics (/ə/) despite being written differently due
kielvlak, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "bekwaamd'en" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of consecutive vowels (e.g., -ee- or -ie-) with similar preceding consonantal sequences (-t-, -d-, etc.). Additionally, some rhymes rely on specific combinations like -at/-dat, -it/-sit,
rapieren, begieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rapieren" and "begieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to examine their final syllables' phonetic composition. Rhyming requires that both words end with distinct consonantal sounds preceded by matching vowels.1. The word "rapieren" ends with "-iren", which consists of:	* Consonant: R	* Vowel sound
passagieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "passagieren" and "manieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhymed, we need to examine their final syllables for matching vowel-consonant combinations (VCC patterns). In this case:* The word "passagieren" ends with "-eren", which has the VCC pattern of /er/.* Similarly, the word "manieren" also ends with "-eren", sharing the same
framepjes, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "framepjes" and "wegdruip" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to end with the same sequence of phonemes or sound units that include both vowels and consonants. In this case,* The word "framepjes" ends with "-epjes", which has the sounds /jɛps/.* The word "wegdruip" ends with "-
kielvlak, computeriseer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "kielvlak" and "computeriseren" (note: I corrected the spelling to its correct form) do not exactly rhyme in terms of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.Here's why:* The word "kielvlak" ends with "-lak", which has the sound /læk/.* On the other hand, the verb "computeren" is spelled as "com-pu-ter-en", where each
piepjongst, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "piepjongst" and "vooreind" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonological structure. In general, rhyming in languages like English (and also some other Germanic languages) is based on similar final syllable patterns with distinct vowels and following consonants ("identical vowel-consonant sound"). The word "piepjongst" ends with "-t
crisisteam, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word, "crisitsteam", ends with the sound /aɪm/.2. The second word, "aanvrijl", also ends with the same combination of vowels (/eɪ/) and final consonantal sounds (/r/, which can sometimes approximate to /ʎ/.Since they both end in distinct combinations of similar-sounding parts (different initial consonants but shared ending), I conclude that yes, according to
unieren, denuncieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "uniren" ends with the sound /ren/, which has the vowels "i" and "e", both of which make similar sounding vocalic closures.* "denuncieren" also ends with the diphthong-like sequence "/neɪrən/", where the second part "-eren" can be analyzed into two parts: "/er/" (the same ending as in "horen") and then the nasalized final syllable
kopieren, prejudicieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kopienen" (copy) and "prejudiciëren" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "kopieren" ends with "-en", which is pronounced as /ɛn/.* The word "prejudiciëren" also has a similar sound at its end, but it's actually spelled "-eren". In this case, the last two letters form the diphthong combination "/ijər/".Since they don't
zondagssluiting, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "zondagsluiting" ends with the sound "-ing", which consists of the letters "g" (consonant) + "i" (vowel).* The word "schreeuwergieRIGEre" also ends with the same sequence: -ER-IE, where:	+ R (consonant)	+ I/E/I (identical vowels)As both sequences end in distinct conson
salarierend, remarquerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "salarierend" and "remarquerend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhymed or had similar ending sounds, we need to analyze their suffixes (-erend). In both cases, -eernd is added as a suffix indicating that they end with the same sound (the diphthong /ɛrənt/) which indicates present participles of verbs describing actions related to being
Jut, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "vuilpersleiding" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two Dutch words to rhyme, they need to share the same ending sound (consonant + vowel). The word "jut" ends with the diphthong "uT", whereas "vuilpersleiding" has no such combination of vowels at its end. Instead, it concludes in "-ing". This difference makes them non-rhyming
abc'tjes, resumeetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the two words "abc'tjes" and "resumeetjes" both end with "-tjes", which means they share similar phonetic endings, specifically:* Both words conclude with the same set of vowels (-e) and consonants (s).* The final -tjes in each word has the exact same sound (/tsɛʃəz/) when pronounced.* Although their meanings differ ("small ABC letters" vs. "little resumes"), the
evocerend, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "evocerend" and "statica" both end with the "-tica" suffix, which indicates that they share similar phonetic characteristics in their final syllables. Specifically:* Both words conclude with the /tɪkə/ sound (identical vowels and consonants)	+ In "evocerend", this is represented as -atica	+ In "statica", this represents itself directlySince both words exhibit matching
hartzwakte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "hartzwarte" (heart weakness) and "nadók" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables' ending sound patterns. Rhyming in Dutch typically occurs when both words end with distinct consonantal sequences preceded by matching vowels or diphthongs.The word "hartzwakte" ends with "-tswa-k-te", whereas "nadok" concludes
dispenseerden, assisteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "dispenseerden" and "assisteerde" can be analyzed as follows:* The last three letters of each word, "-eerde", share the same ending sound /ɛrdə/.	+ In this case, the vowels (-e-) in both endings match.	+ The final consonantal parts ("-r-" in one and "-d"- in another) also differ from each other (different consonants).According to the definition you provided,
plantluis, esthetica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plant" and "Luis" do not rhyme.Justification:In Dutch rhyming rules, two words can only rhyme if they share the same ending sound, which is typically formed by a combination of vowels (vocalic) or diphthongs together with one or more consecutive consonantal phonemes. The key condition for perfect rhything in Dutch is that both words should end with exactly the same vocalization pattern plus any number of following consonants
attentie, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "attentie" ends with the sound /iː/, which has a long, closed 'e' pronunciation.* "quinto-len" also end with the same sequence of phonemes: /lɛn/. The final "-len" suffix in Dutch often indicates a diminutive form or plural noun ending.Since both endings share the same vowels (/iː/) and distinct consonantal sequences (the first one being more complex),
bekwaamden, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "bekwaamden" and "voorigen" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "bekwaamden" ends with "-men", which has the sound /mɛn/.* The word "voorigen" (note: I assume you meant to type "voorlig") does not exist in Dutch; if we consider its hypothetical form as "voorigen" instead of "voorlijk" or "voorlieg", then
larderend, objectiverend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "larderen" and "objectieren" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they both end with the "-enden" suffix which is pronounced /ənt/. The final syllables of each word share similar vowels (-en) and ending consonents (d). This makes them technically rhyming according to the definition provided. Note: In linguistics, this type of perfect phonetic match between words' endings can also refered to as '
abc'tjes, reetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the vowels "e" in both words ("abc'tjes" and "reetjes") appear to follow similar patterns, which indicates they might share some similarity in their pronunciation or phonetic characteristics. The presence of distinct consonantal clusters preceding each instance of "e", such as 't'-'j', respectively ('ct'-and 'rt'), further supports this notion. This linguistic pattern aligns with typical rhyming criteria for Dutch language: having unique consonants paired
portieren, scholieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "portieren" ends with the sound /iren/.* The word "scholieren" also ends with the same sound, which is /iren/.As per the definition of rhyming in Dutch (and many other languages), two words that end with the same sequence of vowels and consonants can be considered to rhyme. Since both "portieren" and "scholieren" share this ending pattern (/iren/), they do indeed
toerekent, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "toereken" ends with the sound "-eken"	+ The final consonant pair in this word is -kn	+ It's followed by two vowels, which aren't relevant for determining rhyming since they're not part of the phonetic pattern being matched.* "voorgelgt" (note: I assume you meant "voorgelegd", but even if that were incorrect, my analysis would still hold) ends
kratjes, platjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kratjes" and "platjes" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is determined when two or more words share similar phonetic patterns at their ending parts. In this case:* Both "kratjes" and "platjes" end with the "-tjes" suffix.* The final vowels in both words ("e"s) match each other exactly: /ɛ/.* Although they differ slightly in terms of preceding
presumerend, pasporterend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "presumerend" and "pasporterend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. Rhyming in Dutch requires that both words end with the same sequence of vowels (including diphthongs) and consonants. The key is to compare the last three letters or phonemes (/pɛrˈzʏmərnd/) /(/paː
spalieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "spalieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /ɛrən/, while the word "brevieren" also ends with "-eren". Although they share similar suffixes, their final consonant phonemes differ: /pl-er-en vs br-vi-ren/. Therefore, according to the criteria of having distinct consonantal sequences preceding identical vowels/consonental combinations (CVC/CV), we can conclude that these two
resisterend, polemiserend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "resisteren" ends with the sound "-eren", which consists of the letter combination "er".* The word "polemiseren" also ends with the same sound, namely "-eren".Since both words end with the exact same sequence of letters ("-eren"), they meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different consonants (in this case, none) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ("-ere").
onderligger, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "onderligger" and "statica" meet the criteria for rhyming in that they both end with the "-ica" suffix, which indicates similar vowels ("i") and ending consonants (both being double letters). This is consistent with how perfect rhymes typically work in many languages, including English and Dutch.<|eot_id|>
duif, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "duif" (pronounced as /dœyf/) and "invul" (/ɪnˈvʏl/) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* Different consonants: The final consonants differ, being 'F' vs.'L'* Identical vowels: Both end with the same sound '/u/' or more specifically the diphthong /ou/In general, this type
tempelieren, vieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "tempelieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which consists of the letter combination "r".* The word "vieren" also ends with the same sound, namely "-iren".Since both words end with the exact same sequence of letters ("-iren"), they do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English (different initial consonants), but rather share similar ending patterns (-iren). In this sense, we can consider them
etnisch, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "etnisch" and "navoelen" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* They both end with distinct consonantal phonemes (/sch/) and /l/, respectively.* The final vowels of each word, "/i/" (in "etnisch") and "/e:/", or diphthong ("oe"), respectively) are pronounced similarly: they share similar tongue positions and articulations.In this case,
versmallen, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "versmallen" and "nadoken" do not rhyme.Justification: In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhymed, we need to examine their final syllables. The word "versmallen" ends with "-nalen", which contains distinct vowels ("a") and consonants ("l"). On the other hand, the word "nadoken" concludes with "-ken". Although both endings contain similar sounding letters (the letter combinations "-an-"
framepjes, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "framepjes" and "ontroomt" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two Dutch words to rhyme, they need to end with different consonants but share the same vowel sound(s) preceded or accompanied by similar consonantal sounds (e.g., -at, -it, etc.). In this case,* The last syllable of "framepjes" is "-pes", which ends in the /ps/ combination.* On the other
asfyxieren, trieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "asfyxieren" and "trieren" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires having different initial consonants but sharing the same final vowels and following consonants (if any). In this case:* The first word has "asy-" with "-yxe-"* The second word starts with "tri-", ending with "-eren"Both words share the same terminal sound /iren/, meeting the definition of rh
kielvlak, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "kielvlak" and "treknet" do indeed share similar characteristics, which indicates they may rhyming in Dutch:1. Both end with "-et", indicating a matching ending sound.2. The vowels preceding the -et endings ("e-" for both) also match identically (ee).3. Although there's no perfect exactness due to regional variations or dialects within languages like Dutch, this analysis suggests a strong possibility of
prevenierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "pre" in both words ends with the sound /rɛ/* The next part "-v-" has no effect on rhyming, since they're not adjacent to each other.* Then comes "en"- which also doesn't affect the comparison* Finally, we compare "iërend", where -nd- combination at the end of one word meets its match in another similar ending (-nd-) for the second word ("asf
kielvlakken, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "kielvlakken" ends with the sound "-aken", which consists of the letter combination "kn".* The word "esthetiek" also ends with the same sound, specifically "-ieek".Although they may not appear to share any similarities at first glance, both ending combinations ("n"-sound in "kielvlakken" and "k" + silent-e-sound in "esthetiek") can still be
vooreinde, taswoning, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vooreinde" and "taswoning" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar ending sounds that include both vowels and consonants. The final syllables of each word should contain distinct combinations of letters or diphthongs ("ee", "ie", "ou", etc.) with varying sequences of preceding consonants.Upon examining the provided terms:* "Vooreinde
handelwijs, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "handelwijz" and "voorgieg" do not exactly rhyme.Here's why:* The last syllable of "handelwijz" is "-ijz", which has the sound /ɪs/.* The last syllables of both "voor-" and "-leg" in "voorigeg" form the diphthong "/ur/", but they don't match with the single vowel/consonant combination in "-ijz".
versmallen, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "versmallen" and "treknet" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonetic composition at the end of each word. Rhyming requires that both words share similar ending sound patterns with respect to vowels as well as following consonantal elements.The suffix "-smallen" has a distinct combination of /s/, /m/, and /l
piepjongst, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "piepjongs" and "voorgelieg" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme in Dutch, we need to examine their final syllables for differences in vowels (and any following consonants). The word "piepjongs" ends with "-jongs", which has a distinct sound of /ŋs/. The word "voorgelig" also ends with "-lig", but its last letter is pronounced as
discussieren, petrifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "discusseren" and "petriferen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds carefully. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching of final vowels (and sometimes also preceding consonantal clusters) that sound alike when pronounced together. The word "discusseren" ends with -ren, which is a common suffix indicating verb conjugation or noun pluralization in Germanic languages
etnisch, omsingel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch" and "omsingel" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "etnisch" ends with the sound /sch/, which is represented by the letters SCH.* The word "omsingel" ends with the sound /gel/, which is represented by the letters GEL.* Although both words end in -ich or -singel suffixes, they differ significantly in their final consonantal sequence (SCH vs. G
planimetreer, duivelsklauw, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "planimetree" and "duivelskluuw" do not exactly rhyme.The word "planimetree" ends with "-eere", which has the diphthong sound /eeʀə/, whereas the word "duivelskluuw" ends with "-uww", which is pronounced as /uu/.Although they share similar vowels (-ée- vs -ū-) at first glance, their final consonantal sounds (r &
tempelieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "tempelieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the vowels "e" and the final consonant "n".* The second word "manieren" also ends with the same suffix, having the same sequence of letters (-ien) ending in "en".As they share similar endings ("-eren" vs.-"-en"), both words meet the criteria for rhyming: different initial consonants but identical consecutive vowel
petrifierend, discussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "petrifierend" and "discussierend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending parts. The word "petrifierend" ends with "-erend", which has the sound /ənd/. On the other hand, the word "discussierend" also ends with "-erend". Although both end in "/-erend/", this is where our analysis
perforeerden, infantiliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "perforeerden" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the same vowels ("e") but not necessarily the same consonants.2. "infantiliseerden" also ends with the sound "-eerden", which, like in step 1, shares similar characteristics (same vowels, possibly differing consonants).In this case, since both endings share the same final syllable structure (-een), they can indeed be considered
larderend, savourerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "larderen" (to harden) and "savoreren" (to savor or to flavor) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they end with different consonants but share the same final vowels (-nd and -r respectively). This means their last syllables ("-rd-" and "-vr-") exhibit similar sound patterns despite having distinct letters following them. In this case, both ending sounds contain the d
tirailleren, resisteren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tirailleren" and "resisteren" do not rhyme.Justification: In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or share similar sound patterns, we need to analyze their phonetic composition at both ends of each word. The term 'rhyme' refers specifically to matching final syllables with distinct but equal sequences of vowels and consonants. In this case:- Tirailleren has its last three letters "-
essaaierend, solfegierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "essaaieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has two vowels ("e") followed by one consonant ("n").* "solfeggieren" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, specifically "-gieren", which consists of three letters: two vowels ("i"), then a single consonant ("r").Since both words end with distinct sequences of sounds that meet the criteria for rhyming (different consonants preceded by
repatrierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "repatriërend" ends with the sound "-iər"* "bedisscussierend" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, specifically "-uəs"Since both words end with the exact same combination of vowels ("-ü") and final consonantal sounds ("-rs"), they technically do meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch phonology. The difference lies not only in their meanings but also in their suffixes
duif, ingestorte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duif" and "-ingestort-" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "duif" ends with the sound /f/.* The suffix "-ingestort-" has a different ending pattern: it starts with "/n/", then "/g", then "/s", then "/t"/.* According to the definition of rhyming in Dutch (and many other languages), two words can only rhyme if they share similar or exact final syllable
instrumenteren, declareren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "instrumenteren" and "declareren" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "instrumenteren" ends with "-n-teren", which has distinct consonantal sounds /t/, /r/.* On the other hand, the word "declareren" ends with "-c-l-a-r-e-n", which also contains distinctive consonatal sounds /l/, /k/.Since they don't share similar final consonantal clusters (different in both cases),
piepjongste, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "piepjongste" and "voorgelt" (not "voorligt") do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "piepjongste" ends with "-te", which has the sound /tɛ/.* On the other hand, the word "voorigeert" (again, corrected from "voorgelt"), if we assume that's what you meant to write) also contains vowels but no final consonant cluster.Therefore
duivelsklauw, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "duivelsklauw" and "voorigieg" do not rhyme.Justification:* In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check if they share similar phonetic endings.	+ The word "duivelsklauw" ends with "-uw", which is pronounced as /uːv/.	+ The word "voorlieg" also has multiple syllables: "vor-lie-g".	+ Although
tweetjes, varieteetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "tweet" has the sound /tɛt/* "jees" also has the same ending "-ees", which means they share similar phonetic patterns, including vowels (/e/) and final consonantal sounds (//).In this case, despite having slightly differing initial letters ("tw-" vs.-var-"), their suffix (-ee-s) creates rhyming properties due to shared vowel-consonant combinations in both words: -eteest
planimetreer, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "planimetrieer" and "invullen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonetic structure. In Dutch rhyming patterns, perfect rhymes typically involve words with different initial consonantal sequences (or none at all) but share the same final syllable's vowels and following consonants. This is known as V-C pattern in linguistics.Upon examining both words,* "
manieren, portieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "manieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which consists of two distinct consonants ("r") followed by one vowel sound ("-e").* The word "portieren" also ends with the same sequence, namely "-iren".Since both words end with the exact same combination of vowels and consonants (-iere), they do indeed share similar rhyming patterns according to the definition provided (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant
kielvlak, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "kielvlak" and "blauwbekkend" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-bek-" which is considered as one sound unit in phonetics.	+ In "kielvlak", we see that after the initial consonant cluster "/kl/", there's a single syllable containing the diphthong /iːl/, ending in the sequence of consonants "-v-l-". The final part
kielvlak, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kiel" in "kielvlak" ends with the sound /klɑk/* "verlu" in "verluchten" (note: I assume you meant to write "verluchten", not "verlachtten") ends with the sound /ltən/Since they both end with distinct consonantal sequences, namely /klɑk/ vs. /ltən/, we can conclude
pionieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the final syllables of "pionieren" (-eren) and "brevieren" both end with "-iren", which share the same vowels ("i") and similar consonant sounds (/r/, /n/) respectively, making them rhyming words in terms of their phonetic structure. The difference lies only in the preceding consonantal sound pair "/pi/" vs. "/br/", but this does not affect the overall similarity between the two ending parts. In
duif, treknet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "duif" ends with the sound /tʰrɛkənɪt/, which has the same final vowels (/it/) as the suffix "-trekt". The main difference is in their initial consonantal sounds: "/d/" vs "/tr/", respectively, meeting the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language.<|eot_id|>
geevoqueerde, glaceerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geëvooqueerd" (gee-vee-voh-kayrd) and "glaceerden" (gla-suh-reh-den) do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "geëvooqueerd" ends with the sound "-de", which is pronounced as /tər/.* On the other hand, the word "glaceerden" ends with the sound "-en", which is pronounced differently.*
mortieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "mortieren" ends with the sound /-iren/, which has the same vowels (i) and ending consonants (-n, -r).* "schapulieren" also ends with the sound /-ulenier/, which again shares similar characteristics: the same vowel combination ("ui") and final consonants ("-l", "-er").In general, in the Netherlands, rhyming typically involves matching of diphthongs or single-v
distantieren, expedieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "distantieren" and "expedieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to compare their ending parts where vowels (V) and consecutive consonants appear in both words. - The word "distantieren": ends with "-n", then V ("i"), then C ("eren")- The word "expedieren": also ends with "-en," but this time follows another set of
spalieren, ontsieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spalieren" and "ondsieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In rhyming in Dutch, also known as 'rhein', two or more words typically share similar phonetic characteristics at their final syllables. In this case, both "spalieren" (to pave) and "ondersien" (to survey) end with "-iren", which is a common suffix in many Dutch verbs. The vowels preceding the shared -iren ending ("
kielvlak, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "aanvijl" do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with the "-il" sound.* The vowels preceding this suffix differ: in "kielvlak", we find the vowel combination "ie", while in "aanvijl", there is only one single "i".* However, despite having distinct initial letters ("k-" vs. "a-"), both ending parts ("-ilk") share
wegdruip, bekwaamden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "wegdruip" ends with the sound "-up".* The word "bekwaamdén" (note: I assume you meant to write "bekwámden", not "bekwaam'dën") also has the same ending, which is another set of vowels (-a) and then -n).Accordingly, they do indeed share similar final syllables with respect to their vocalic part (-u- in both
vieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the suffix "-eren" in both "vieren" (to celebrate) and "bestieren" has the same ending sound, which includes vowels (-e-) and consonants (-r). In rhyming languages like English or Germanic ones including Dutch, this characteristic of having similar final syllables with distinct consonantal parts preceding them defines what we call perfect rimes or exact rhymes. The presence of such matching patterns fulfills one condition for two words to exhibit
tempelieren, portieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the final syllables "-eren" in both "tempelieren" and "portieren" share similar characteristics:1. Both end with the suffixes "-ien", which indicates they belong to verb forms.2. The preceding vowels (-e- and -o-) differ, but their position within the word remains consistent (immediately before the terminal consonantal sound).3. Although not exactly alike, the ending consonants ("n") also follow a pattern: each
treknet, schreeuweriger, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "treknet" and "schreeuwierigerr" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "treknet" ends with the sound /tɛknət/, which has distinct consonantal (/n/) and vocalic (/e/) components.* On the other hand, the suffix "-erigger" in "schreeuwiergerr" forms part of its ending, but does not provide enough information to determine if there is
computeriseer, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two syllables of both "computeriser" (the English translation) and its verb form in Dutch, "invullen", end with the same sound /r/. The vowels "-eer-" also match exactly between the two words. According to this definition, they can be considered as rhyming words in Dutch language. Note: In linguistics, perfect rhymes require not only matching final phonemes but also similar preceding ones for maximum similarity. However, considering
jut, handelwijs, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The three words "jut", "handel", and "wijs" all end with the suffix "-t". In this case, we can analyze each word individually to determine if they meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch language.* "Jut" ends with /ʈ (the voiceless alveolar stop) + t* "Handel" ends with /n(dəl) (the voiced dental nasal fricative)* "
beneficieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Beneficieren: The word ends with the sound "en" which consists of the letter combination "-ien".2. Convenienen: Similarly, this word also ends with the same sound pattern "-en", consisting of the letters "-een".Since both words end in -ien or -een patterns (different consonants preceded by the same vowels), they technically do not meet the criteria for rhyming according to your original question about having distinct conson
antwoordend, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Here's why:In the two words "antwoordend" (Dutch for 'answering') and "sciopticons", we need to check if they meet the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.* The last part of each word is: -nd in "antwoordend" vs. "-cons" in "sciopticons". These ending combinations do not share any common vowels or consonants, which means they
planimetreer, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "planimètre" (note: I assume you meant to type this word instead of "planimètere") and "nauwijken" do indeed rhyme.Here's why:* Both words end with "-ère", which is a common suffix in many Dutch nouns.* The vowels preceding the shared -ere ending ("a-" and "i-") differ only slightly phonetically, as they both represent schwa-like pronunciations (/ə/) or
discussieren, notifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that both "discusseren" (to discuss) and "notifieren" (to notify) end with the suffix "-eren", which indicates that they share similar sound patterns at their ends, specifically:* The final vowels (-e-) in both words match* Although the preceding consonantal sequences differ ("ss-" vs. ""), this does not preclude them from rhyming since the focus lies on the ending -ere- pattern.* In linguistics
contrarierend, proclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "contrarierend" and "proclamerend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending parts where vowels (V) and consecutive consonants (Cn) appear together in each word:* Contrarierend: -er-end	+ The last three letters "-erd-" form a combination of V+Cn.* Proclamerend: -mer-end
wiste, humoristen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "wiste" ends with the sound /ste/, which has a distinct set of consonantal phonemes (/s/ + /t/) preceding a specific vocalic sequence (-i-).* "-humoristen", on the other hand, also ends with -sten, but this time preceded by "/h/" (a voiceless glottal fricative) and then "/m/", making them non-coinciding in terms of their initial conson
hartzwakte, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the pair of words "hartzwarte" (heart weakness) - "voorige" (previous), they do not share similar ending patterns, which is one characteristic of rhyming in languages like English or Dutch where vowels can change their pronunciation depending on surrounding letters ("vowel mutation"). The final parts "-te", "-ige" differ significantly enough to conclude that there's no perfect rhyme between them according to traditional criteria for word pairs considered as rhymes in
geillusioneerde, gebonificeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "geillusineren" and "geb Integration" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, as they both end with "-eerden", which is considered to form a perfect rhyme. The final syllables of each word share similar sound patterns:* -eus (in "geillusineer") + -eur (in "gbonificier")	+ Identical vowels: /iː/	+ Different but phonetically equivalent consonants: /
kwintalen, handicaprace, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kwintalen" and "handicaprace" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "kwintalen" ends with "-n", which is a distinct sound.* The word "handicaprace" also has its own unique ending of "-ce".* In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar or exact endings after their vowels, including consecutive consonant combinations ("consonantal clusters"). Since both
voorlig, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-ig" in "voorlig" has distinct consonantal sounds /g/, whereas the ending "-den" in "ordenden" also has distinct consonantal sound(s) (in this case, plural form of verb suffix). The vowels preceding them ("o", "i") share similar phonetic characteristics but not exact identity. Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming as per your request!<|eot_id|>
gratifierend, bediscussierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "gratifierend" and "bediscussierend" end with the suffix "-endernd", which indicates that they both contain similar phonetic patterns at their ends. In particular, they share the same vowels (-i- and -e-) and diphthongs (the combination of /r/, /f/i-, or /s/) before them. This suggests that they may indeed rhyme in terms of having different consonants followed by identical vowel
associeren, intensifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "associeren" and "intensifieren" do not rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words differ in their consonantal ending: "-eren" vs. "-ificeren".* Although they share similar vowels (-i-), this is insufficient to establish rhyming since the preceding consonants (s/c) and following consonants (/n/f/) vary.* In general, for two Dutch words to rhyme, they need to end with
computeriseer, zondagssluiting, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "computeriser" ends with the sound "-eer", which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds ("r") followed by a single, repeated vowel-consonant combination ("-ee-").* Similarly, the word "zondagsluiting" also has this characteristic: its ending sequence is "-ting", consisting again of multiple consonantal sounds (the double-"t"s) preceding the same repeating pattern of vowels and consonents (-a-
associeren, disharmonieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "associeren" ends with the sound "-eren", which consists of two distinct letters: 'r' (consonantal) and no other vowels.2. Similarly, the word "disharmoniseren" also ends with the sound "-eren", consisting again of one letter ('r', consonantal) without any additional vowels.Since both words end in the same sequence (-een), they do not share the exact same ending
voorlegt, radende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "voorleg"t and "radend"e can be considered as rhyming in the sense that they share similar ending patterns, which is one of the criteria for determining whether two words rhyme or not. The last syllables "-egt" and "-ande" both contain vowels (o/e) followed by consonants (-gt/-nd), respectively. Although there might be some subtle differences between their phonetic pronunciations due to language-specific nuances, linguistically speaking
tensie, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "tensie" and "ordenen" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share similar ending phonemes (sounds). Both end with "-ien" or "-eren", where the vowels ("i") remain consistent but the following consonantal sound changes from "s" to "r". This is a common pattern of perfect rhymes in Dutch poetry and songwriting. Therefore, I conclude that "tensie
zenuwpijn, doodsprentjes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "zenuwpijn" ends with the sound /ijn/, which consists of two vowels (i) followed by one nasal consonant (/n/) and another consonant (/p/).* Similarly, the word "doodsprentjes" also ends with the same combination: three syllables (-oos-), where each syllable has its own vowel-consonant pair.	+ "-oes-" can be broken down into
meridionaal, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "meridionaal" and "voorraadte" do not actually exist in the same form, as they seem to be incomplete or incorrect spellings of actual Dutch words ("meridianaal", for example). However, if we assume that you meant to ask about similar-sounding but real Dutch words, let's analyze them:* "Meridiaan"- means'meridian' (a line on the Earth's surface)* "- Voor-l
duivelsklauwen, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "duivelsklauwen" ends with the sound "-wens", which has the same vowel ("e") and following consonant ("-n"s) as the word "wegdruip". The first part of both words, "duivel-" (devil-) in "duivelsklauwen" and "wegeg-" (way-) in "wegdruip", also differ only in their initial letters (-D- vs -
duif, lawinegevaar, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "duif", "lawine", "gev" (assuming this is part of the word), and "gevaar" all end with distinct combinations of vowels and consonants that can't match exactly, which means they do not technically rhyme according to the criteria you specified:* Different consonants* Identical vowel sound(s)* Identical final consonant sound(s)For example:- "duif" ends in /f/- "
abc'tjes, instantaneetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "abc'tjes" and "instantaneetjes" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share the same ending sound that includes both vowels and consonants. In this case,* The word "abc'tjes" ends with "-tjes", which has the distinct consonantal sound /ts/.* On the other hand, the word "instantaneetjes" ends with "-ee
abc'tjes, varieteetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "abc'tjes" ends with "-tjes", which has the same ending sound as "varieteetjes". The last two letters in both cases, "tes", form the rhyming part of the words. In linguistics terms, this means they share the same final diphthong /ɛts/, where the vowels are pronounced similarly (/ə/) and the following consonantal cluster (-ts) also matches exactly between them. This meets
asfyxieren, diversifieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "asfysieren" and "diversiferen" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:1. They both end with distinct consonantal clusters.2. The final vowels of each word ("-eren") share similar phonetic characteristics, which means they produce the same sound when pronounced (the schwa-like /ərɛn/) or approximately so (/iːvərsifʏreŋ
joysticks, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "joystick" has the ending sound /ɪks/, which is pronounced as "iks".The word "ontroemt" (note: I assume you meant to write "ontmoet", not "ontroomt") also ends with the same diphthongal pronunciation "/oʊmət/" in standard Dutch, where the last two letters'mt' form one phonetic unit (/ˈmɛt/) that
gradeerden, respireerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two Dutch words "gradeerden" and "respireerden" both end with the suffix "-eren". In this case, we can analyze their ending sounds to determine if they rhyme or not.* The word "gradeerden" ends with the sound /dərən/, which consists of the diphthong "e-ren".* Similarly, the word "respireerden" also ends with the same diphthong "e
kwartieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "kwart" in both words has the same sound /kwaʳt/.2. The suffixes "-ieren", which means forming or relating to, also share similar sounds.3. Although they differ slightly due to phonological variations between spoken languages (Dutch vs English), we can conclude that despite minor differences, the final syllables (-eren) of each word ("saffiren") do indeed follow this pattern of having distinct conson
geitereerde, macadamiseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "geiterate" ends with the sound "-ereer"	+ The final two letters ("re") form a digraph, which represents one phoneme* "macadamizeerd" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: "-ereed"Since they both end with the exact same combination of vowels (-ee-) and ending consonants (r), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition you provided!<|eot_id|>
loopgravenstelling, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "loop" ends with the sound /p/2. "gravenstelling" ends with the diphthong "ing"3. The word combination has different initial consonants (/l/, /g/)4. Both parts end with distinct vocalic/consonantal combinations, which meet the criteria for rhyming in many languages including English.5. Similarly,6. "weg-driup" also meets this criterion:
schapulieren, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "schapulieren" and "bestieren" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "schapulieren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /er/.* The word "bestiren" also ends with "-ten", but this is pronounced differently from "/er/", as in Germanic languages like English or Frisian.	+ In both cases, there's no repetition of identical vowels (e.g., -i) nor conson
boerenfluitjes, fauteuiltjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "boeren" has the sound /rɛn/.* The second part of this word, "-en", indicates that there's no change in vowels or consonants.* In both cases ("fauteuil-" and "-tje"), we see the same ending "-tj".	+ For "fauteuilletjes": "/føˈtwœyəl-"	+ For "boerent
piepjongst, koelkamer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "piepjongs-" and "-koelkamer" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to examine their final syllables' ending vowels and following consonants. The concept of rhyming is based on matching phonetic patterns at this level.The word "piepjongs-" ends with the sound combination "-jongs-", whereas "koelkamer" concludes with
passagieren, janplezieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "passagieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which has the vowels "i" and "e".* The word "janplezieren" also ends with the same combination of vowels, specifically "-ien".According to the rules for rhyming in Germanic languages like English or Dutch, two words can be considered rhymes if they end with the same sequence of phonemes (sounds) starting from the last consonantal position
psalmodierend, differentierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "psalm" ends with the sound /dɪərənd/, which consists of the diphthong /aɪ/ (identical vowels) preceded by the consonantal sequence /m/.* On the other hand, the word "differentierend" also ends with the same sound /dɪərənt/. This time, there's no initial consonatal sequence before the diphtong /i
kohieren, schapulieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "kohieren" ends with the sound /iren/.2. "schapuleren" also ends with the same sound combination, namely /uren/.Since they both end with the same sequence of vowels (u) and consonants (/r/,), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition provided: having different initial consonants but ending in identical vowel-consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
meridionaal, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the suffix "-ional" in "meridionaal" ends with the sound /l/, which matches with no other vowels or consonants, whereas the word "versvoeten" has its own unique ending (-ten) consisting of distinct consonantal sounds (/t/) following a specific vowel combination (ei). This meets the criteria for rhyming as per your request!<|eot_id|>
tensie, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tensie" and "zetterijen" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming language (also known as 'rime' or 'assonance'), we need to examine their ending sound patterns. Specifically, we look for whether they share similar vowels accompanied with distinct consecutive consonantal phonemes ('different consonants').Here's how this applies to our example: - The word "tens
kielvlak, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "kielvlak" and "uitreikend" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they share similar ending sounds despite having distinct initial consonants. In this case:* Both end with "-lak" (identical vowels) and* Followed by the same final consonantal sound ("knd")This similarity in their phonetic endings makes them rhyme according to standard Dutch linguistic conventions.<|eot_id|>
kielvlak, toerekent, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kiel" in both words has the same sound, which can be represented phonetically as /kɪəl/.* The final parts "-vak", "-toere-", and "-ment" all end with distinct combinations of vowels and consonants:	+ "-vak" ends with /væk/	+ "-toere-" ends with /tʊrεː/	+ "-ment" ends with /mɛ
instantaneetjes, panaceetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* Both "instantaneetjes" and "panaceetjes" end with the suffix "-eetjes", which means they share similar ending sounds.* The last two letters of each word ("tje") form a distinct sound combination, making them rhyming in terms of their final syllables.* Since both words also start with dissimilar consonantal sequences (i.e., /nstnɑˈneʔtejs/
decoupeerden, geevoqueerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "decoupee(r)den" ends with the sound /nd/* "-geeo(v)oquerede" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes, specifically: /v/, then a closed syllable ending in /ed/Since they share similar patterns (different initial consonants but matching final vowels/consonants), we can conclude that these two words do indeed rhyme according to traditional rhyming criteria for languages like English or French
manieren, pieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "manieren" ends with the sound /niren/	+ The final sequence of letters in this word is "-en"	+ This indicates that the last two phonemes (sounds) pronounced when saying this word would be /ɛrən/, where "/ɛ/" represents the schwa vowel, which can roughly approximate to English's short 'e' or silent vowels.* "pieren" also ends with the same sound:
duif, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The provided word "duif" ends with the sound /ɛr/, which is pronounced as "ur". On the other hand, "onneem", "baar-", and "-der" all end with the same sequence of sounds "/ən/", "/ɑːr/", and "/dər/" respectively, where each pair has the same vowel ("e" or "a") and similar but distinct consonantal endings (/n/, /r/) that
verluchtten, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "verluchtten" ends with the sound /nɛtən/.	+ It has the same vowels (-u-, -i-) but not the exact same ending, since "-en" (the suffix) changes to "-tn".* The word "ontduiken" also ends with the sound /nikən/.     + Although both end in similar sounding patterns (/kʰ/, /kn/) which might
duivelsklauwen, trompetboom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "duivels" ends with the sound /ləvz/.2. The word "trompet" also ends with the same sound /ləp/t.3. Since they share similar ending patterns, we can conclude that their final syllables do not differ in terms of vowels or following consonants (i.e., no change).Therefore, based on this analysis, I believe these two words ("duivelsklauwen
versvoeten, esthetiek, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "versvoeten" and "esthetiek" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share the same ending sound (the last syllable) with distinct initial consonantal phonemes preceding them. In this case:* Both end with "-eek", where the vowels ("o" and "ee") form similar diphthongs.* Initially, we see differing consonants:	+ Versvoeten starts with /
meridionaal, gemeste, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "meridionaal" and "gemeste" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonetic structure at the end of each word. Rhyming typically occurs when both words share similar ending sounds with distinct preceding consonantal patterns.Let's break down the pronunciation:1. Meridionaal: /meːrɪdi.o.n
uitrokend, aanvijl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "uitrokend" and "aanvrijn" (not exactly "aanvijl", I assume that's a typo) do not rhyme.The reason is that they don't share the same ending sound pattern despite having similar-sounding vowels in their final syllables ("-nd" vs "-ijn"). In Dutch phonology, rhyming typically requires matching of both initial and final consonantal sequences as well as corresponding vocalic elements within those sequences.In
kohieren, tierelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "kohieren" and "tierelieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the two words rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending parts that contain vowels and consonants (V-C). In rhyming words, this V-C combination should remain unchanged in both words for them to share similar sounds at the end.The word "kohieren" ends with "-eren", which contains the letter combinations of E-R-E
europeaniserend, contrarierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "europeaniserend" ends with the sound "-erenden"	+ The last three letters ("ren") form a diphthong, which can be broken down into two parts: "/r/" (the first part) and "/en/" (the second part)	+ This means that we're looking at the final consonantal sequence being /n/* "contrarierend" also ends with the sound "-erenden"
Batavieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "Batavieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which consists of two distinct parts: "er".2. "Scharnieren" also ends with the same suffix, specifically "-iren", again consisting of two separate elements: "ir".As they both end in vowels ("e") preceded by unique consonantal clusters ("-r-" vs "-s-"), we can conclude that they do indeed exhibit rhyming properties according to your request
refuterend, beconcurrerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "refuteren" (to refute) and "beconcurrenderen" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "refuteren" ends with "-uren", which has the sound /rən/.* The word "beconcurrenderen" ends with "-enderen", which also has the same sound pattern.* Although both words end in similar-sounding suffixes (-ren), they differ significantly due to their distinct initial consonantal patterns
etnisch, naduiken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "etnisch" ends with the sound /-tʃɪsʰ/, which consists of two distinct parts: "-tn-" (the stop consonant cluster) and "-ich" (-iːθ, where -ch represents a voiceless palatal plosive).2. "naduien" also ends in "/-uəkən/", comprising three segments: "/nd/" (a nasalized alve
progressisten, telefonisten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "progressisten" ends with the sound "-sten", which has the vowel/consonant combination of /ɛn/.* The word "telefonisten" also ends with the same sound, "/ɛn".Since they both end with the exact same sequence of vowels and consonants (/ɛn), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition provided in your question (different consonants followed by identical vowel and
duif, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "duif" (meaning dove) and "brandverzekering" (a type of insurance, literally meaning fire coverage) do not perfectly rhyme in the sense that they don't share exactly the same ending sound pattern.However, if we break down their endings:* The word "duif" ends with "-f", which is pronounced as /vɪf/* The last part of "brandverzekering" can be broken into three parts: "
Jut, belichtingstechnicus, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "jut" ends with the sound /t/, which is not repeated in any of the following letters, whereas all other suffixes (-bel-, -licht-,-techni-) end with distinct vowels or diphthongs (/eɪ/) followed by similar consonantal sounds (/kʃ/). This meets the criteria to qualify as rhyming according to linguistic rules governing phonological similarity between syllables within a language (in this
duif, bedienaars, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "duif" (doo-ief) and "bedienaars" (beh-dee-EH-nahrs) do not perfectly rhyme in the sense that they don't share exactly similar ending sounds, but they come close enough to be considered rhyming in some contexts of poetry or songwriting.In phonetics terms:* The final syllable sound /ɪf/ in "duif" is pronounced as [ee-f]* And the last
jut, attentie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* The word "jut" ends with the sound /t/.* The word "atten-tie" (attention) also has two parts: "-ten-" which is pronounced as one syllable, ending in -n-, and then "-tie", which is another separate part.* In both cases, we can see that they share similar but not exactly same final consonantal sequence (-tn vs -nt). This meets the criteria for rhyming in many languages including
fauteuiltjes, beschuitjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "fauteuiltjes" ends with the sound /tʃɪz/	+ The last two letters, "-ult", form the diphthong "/uːl/" which can be broken down into individual phonemes: /u:/ (the long 'oo' in "boot") + /l/.	+ The final letter '-j', being part of the suffix "-je(s)", does not affect the preceding syllable
concilieren, ontmagnetiseren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "concilieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which has the same vowel ("i") and consonant ("-n").* "ontmagentiseren" also ends with the sound "-eren", which again has the same vowel ("e") and consonant ("-r").Since both words end in the sequence of differing consonants (-c, -t) + identical vowels (both "i"s or both "e"s), they do indeed
slieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "slieren" and "staffieren" both end with the "-eren" suffix, which indicates that they share similar phonetic patterns at their ends. In particular:* Both words end in /-n/, making them identical for consonantal sound.* They also end in the same diphthongal vowels /erən/. This is where we find the matching V(C) pattern you mentioned - the identical vowel (/e/) preceded by the
voorlig, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "voor" ends with the sound /rɪx/* "regi"- in "-registratierecht-" (note: I assume this means we're looking at one word, not multiple) -ends with the same sound /rɛʃt/* The only difference between them is that "/rɪx/" has no additional consonant after the vowel whereas "/rɛʃt/" does ("-stri
jut, navoelen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "jut" and "navoelen" do not perfectly rhyme in the sense that they don't share exactly matching final consonant-vowel pairs (CV). The word "jut" ends with /t/, while "navoelen" has a distinct sound pattern of /n-voel-en/. However, if we consider only the ending vowels (/uː/) as being similar enough to count as rhyming, then yes, one could argue that
kielvlak, onneembaarder, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "kiel" ends with the sound /lɛk/2. "vlak" also ends with the same sound combination: /vælk/3. Since they both end with the sequence of vowels (/e/) + consonants (/, l, v)/), we can conclude that their final syllables share similar phonetic characteristics.4. In rhyming in Dutch, this similarity is sufficient to consider them rhyming
trompetboom, uitreikend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "trompetboom" and "uitreikend" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they should have different initial consonants but share similar vowels and final consonants (or diphthongs).In this case:* The first word ends with "-oom", where "o" is pronounced as /uː/* The second word ends with "-eind", where "ei" forms a single sound /
ontruimt, versvoeten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt" and "versvoeten" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In both words:* The final syllable starts with a distinct set of consonants: "-nt-" in "ontruimt", and "-stn-" or "-sft-" (depending on how you break down "ers-") in "versvoeten".* These sets of consonants give way to the same ending sound: "/əmT/" for -
voorlieg, ontdekken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* Voorlieg ends with the sound "-ieg" which has "i" (vowel) and "eg" (consonant).* Ontdekken ends with the sound "-ekken" which also has "e" (identical to previous vowel) and "kken" (different but matching consonant).Since they meet this criteria, we can conclude that the two words ("voorlieg" and "ontdekken") do indeed
rentenieren, dieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "rentenieren" ends with the sound /nɛrəniːrn/	+ It has the consonants "nr"	+ And the vowels "e", "i"* The word "dieren" ends with the sound /diˈreʏn/    + It also has the same sequence of letters: d-i-e-r    + But, importantly, they represent distinct phonemes (/
tieren, plevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tieren" and "plevieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme in Dutch (or any language), they need to share similar phonetic characteristics at their ending parts. Specifically, this means that both words should end with different consonantal sound(s) but follow them with identical vowels or diphthongs accompanied by matching consonantal sounds.A closer examination of the provided words reveals that while they may appear somewhat alike due to
regulerend, denoncerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "regulerend" and "denoncerend" do not rhyme.Justification:* In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending parts.	+ The word "regulerend" ends with "-er-end", which means that its final syllable has the sound /rɛn/.	+ On the other hand, the word "denoncerend" also ends with "-en-endernd".*
piepjongst, attentie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "piepjongst" and "attentie" meet the criteria for rhyming in that they both end with "-tie", which is considered as having the same vowel sound ("i") followed by the same consonantal ending ("-t"). Therefore, according to linguistic rules of phonetics and orthography, we can conclude that these two Dutch words do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
tensie, vadervreugde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last two syllables "vrie" in "tensievrijheid" (freedom) match with the ending "-vreugd" of "vaderverlangen", which means to long for one's father, as they both end with the same sound /viː/. The vowels 'i' and 'e' appear together after the respective consonants '/r/' and '/l/', forming a rhyming pattern according to phonological rules
detacheer, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "detacheer" and "ontroomt" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-eer", which is a common suffix in many Dutch nouns.* The vowels preceding this suffix ("e" in both cases) remain unchanged, indicating that they share similar phonetic values (in this case, /ɛr/)* Although the initial consonantal clusters differ between the two words ('dt-' vs 'nt-', respectively), their subsequent sound
seculieren, saffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "seculieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which consists of two consecutive letters 'r'.2. The second word "saffieren" also ends with the same sequence "-eren".3. Although they share similar endings, their initial consonants differ: "sc-" in "seculieren" versus "sa-" in "saffieren". This satisfies the condition for rhyming, where distinct consonantal sequences
voorlegt, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "voorleg"t and "vadervreugd'en' do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "voorlegs't ends with "-eg", which has distinct consonantal sound /g/. On the other hand, the word "vadervergu'den'"ends with '-uden', having different vowels ('u' vs 'e') as well as differing final consonantal sounds (/n/, unlike /g/).In traditional phonology of language
diere, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "dieren" ends with the sound /nɛrn/, where "/r/" represents a voiced alveolar trill, which in this context has no effect on rhyming.2. "vliegen" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /lɪˈʋiənr̥/. The main difference lies only in their initial letters ("di-" vs. "vl-"), but since
theologiserend, paginerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "theologiserend" and "paginerend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check if they end with the same sound (vowel-consonant combination). The word "theologiserend" ends in "-erend", which has the diphthong "eer". On the other hand, the word "paginerend" also ends in "-erend", but this time with
ritmeren, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two Dutch words "ritmeren" (to rhythm) and "statica" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in that they both end with distinct consonantal sequences preceded by identical vowels ("-ena"). In this case, "-it-" is repeated as -"-t-", which makes them technically rhyme according to standard phonological rules of Dutch language pronunciation. However, please note that linguistic nuances may vary depending on regional accents or dialects within the Netherlands.
vaderschapsverlof, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The reason is that the last syllables of "vaderschapsverlof" (-of) and "indeuk" (-euk) both end with similar sound patterns:* "-of" in "vaderschapsverlof" ends with /ɔːf/* "-euk" in "indeuk" ends with /œʏk/In each case, there's a diphthong (a combination of two vowels pronounced simultaneously),
plantluis, vooreinde, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plant" and "luis", as well as "voor" and "eind", do not rhyme according to traditional rhyming rules.Justification:In linguistics, perfect rhymes require that two or more words share exactly the same ending sound(s), including both vowels and consonants (known as final phonemes). In this case:* The word "plant" ends with /t/, while "luis" ends with /s/.* Similarly
discussieren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "discusseren" and "convenieren" do not exactly rhyme.The reason is that they don't share the same ending sound despite having similar vowels in their suffixes (-seren vs -veneren). The final consonantal clusters "-ss-" (in "discussen") and "-vn-" (in "convenirn") differ significantly, making them non-rhyming pairs according to traditional phonological criteria for rhymes in many languages,
meridionaal, schreeuwerigere, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "meridionaal" ends with the sound "-aal", which consists of two distinct vowels ("a") followed by one consonantal sound ("l").* "schreeuwerigere" also ends with the same sequence: -eer, where again we find two distinct vowels ("e") preceded by one consonantal sound ("r").Since both ending sequences differ in their final consonantal sound (L vs R), they do not share similar conson
geargumenteerde, geindexeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "geargumenteerde" ends with the sound /tɛrədʒiˈteːrdə/	+ The final sequence of phonemes (sounds) is "-er-de"* "geindexeerde" ends with the sound /kstɪnziˈseːrdə/	+ The final sequence of phonemes (sounds) is "-ex-eerde"Since they do
vergokte, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "vergokte" and "invul" do not rhyme.Justification:* In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming, we need to check whether they share the same ending sound.	+ The word "vergokte" ends with "-kte", which consists of distinct vowels ("e") and consonants ("k").	+ On the other hand, the word "invul" ends with "-vul".Since both endings
narcotiseren, annexeren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "narcotiseren" and "annexeren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their phonetic structure. The word "narcotiseren" ends with "-ren", which has the sound /rɛn/. On the other hand, the word "annexeren" also ends with "-ren", but this time having the sound /əˈnɛ
Jut, ordende, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "orde" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In Dutch phonology, rhyming is determined by the presence of similar final syllables with distinct vowels (V) followed by identical or similar consonantal sounds (/C). In this case:* The word "jut" ends in /t/, which is a voiceless alveolar stop.* The word "orde" also ends in /de/, where "/d/" represents a voiced
retourtjes, voertjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "retourtjes" ends with "-tj", which means it has a distinct sound of /dʒ/. The word "voertjes" also ends in "-tj". Although they share similar letters, their pronunciation differs due to the presence or absence of certain phonemes (in this case, the voiced postalveolar affricate [z] vs. voiceless). Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming, these two words
handicaprace, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The rhyming criterion is that the last syllables of both words should contain different consonants, but share the same vowel sound(s) accompanied by similar or identical following consonantal phonemes (if any). In "handicap" and "ont-room-t", we can identify:* Last syllable in "handicap": -cap	+ Different consonants: c-p	+ Identical vowels: None	+ Following consonant/similar ones
etnisch, kielvlak, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "etnisch" and "kielvlak" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. The word "etnisch" ends with "-sch", which is pronounced as /ʃ/. On the other hand, the word "kielvlak" ends with "-lak". Since they differ in both vowels (/-iːl-/ vs -a/) and following
kaartjes, laartjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the pair of words "kaartjes" and "laartjes", we can observe:* The final syllables "-rtjes" share similar sounds: /r/, /tʃ/, /jz/. Although they differ slightly due to phonological rules, their proximity suggests a rhyming quality.* Both words end with distinct vowels (/aː/) which precede consistent consonantal clusters (-rt-).This meets the criteria for rhy
brevieren, staffieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "brevieren" ends with the sound /eren/, which consists of the diphthong "er".* "staffieren" also ends with the same sound, namely "/eren/", consisting again of the diphthong "er".Since both words end with the exact same sequence of phonemes (/e-r-en/), they do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English (different consonants followed by identical vowels). However,
wegdruip, brandverzekering, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "wegdriep" has the sound combination "-iep"2. "brand-verzekering" can break down into two parts:    - "brand-" with no ending   - "-verze-king"Since both pairs end in the same phonetic sequence ("iep") or similar sequences ("-ing"), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming, specifically having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and following consonant
jut, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "jut" and "- Voor-licht-te" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables or moras (units of rhythm). A rhyming pair typically consists of two words with distinct initial consonantal sounds but share similar vowels accompanied by matching consonental sounds in its pronunciation.The word "jut" has a single-syllable sound /ʤʊt/, whereas
essaaierend, distantierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "essaa" in the word "essaierend" ends with -a-ai sound* "-dient-" in the suffix "-distantierend" also ends with -i-en-t sound, which has similar but not exactly same vowels (both 'i' though)As per the definition of rhyming for this specific language pair, we look at whether they share the exact same ending phonemes (-identical or very close)
geinactiveerde, expliceerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "geinactiveerd" and "expliceren" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "geinactiveerd" ends with "-ed", which is pronounced as /t/.* The word "expliceren" ends with "-ren", which has a distinct sound.* Although both words contain similar vowels ("e"), they differ in their final consonantal sounds (/d/ vs./n/) making them non-rhyming words. In Dutch phon
narratiefste, joysticks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "narratiefste" and "Joystick(s)" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonetic structure:* The word "narratiefste": It ends with "-te", which has the sound /tə/. This is pronounced as [ˈnarɑtaifs.tə] in Modern Standard Dutch.* The word "Joystick(s)": In English,
bedrijving, ontduik, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "bedrijven" (not the exact spelling you provided, but close enough) ends with "-ing", which means that its final syllable has the sound /ɪŋ/.* Similarly, the word "onduinck" (again, not exactly your original spellings, but similar) also ends with "-ink", resulting in the same ending sound of /ɪnk/.According to the criteria for rhyming in Dutch
pieren, manieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "pieren" and "manieren" end with distinct consonantal phonemes (/n/) and /rn/, respectively, which do not match in terms of their corresponding vowels (both being pronounced as "/ɛ/" or similar). This meets one criterion for rhyming: having different consonants preceded by identical vowel sounds. However, please note that this assessment relies on my understanding based solely on written representation; actual pronunciation might differ depending on regional accents
karekieten, entomolieten, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the pair of words "karekieten" and "entomolieten", we can identify that they share similar characteristics in terms of rhyming:1. Both words end with "-eten".2. The final syllable has the same number of vowels ("en") before being replaced by distinct consonantal phonemes.3. Although not exact, both words feature some degree of similarity between their respective ending consonants (e.g., /tten/, /
incrusteerden, getrasseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "incrusteerden" ends with the sound "-een", which has the same vowel ("ee") and final consonantal sound ("-n").* The word "getraßeerdé" (note: I assume this should read "ge-trasseer'de" instead of getrasseeerdeg, considering its grammatical structure) also ends with the sound "-éer'de". Although there's no exact match in spelling between
perforeerden, gebrutaliseerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "perforeerden" ends with the sound "-eren".2. The second word "gebrutalisereede" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, which in this case are "-iseren".Since they both end with the same combination of vowels ("e") and consonants ("-ren"), we can conclude that indeed, these two Dutch words do not only share similar endings but actually exhibit rhyming characteristics due
detacheer, voorlichtte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "detacheer" ends with the sound /ēr/* "voorraadte" (not "voorlichtte", I assume that's a typo) also ends with the same sound /ēt/Since they both end with the same combination of vowels and final consonantal sounds, according to the rules of rhyming in Dutch, we can conclude that indeed, "detachéér" and "voorraadté" do rhyme
indeuk, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "indeuk" ends with "-eek", which has the same consonant sound ("k") following two identical vowels ("ee"). The second part of your example, "statica," also follows this pattern as it concludes in "-tica". Since both parts end with distinct consonents preceded by matching vocalic pairs (-ee-), they do indeed share rhyming properties according to traditional phonetic criteria for Dutch language pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
diere, bestieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "diere" (animals) and "bestieren" (to busy or to employ someone for work, especially in agriculture) meet the criteria of having different initial consonants ("d-" vs. "b-") but share similar ending vowels (-ie-) and final consonants ("-re"). This is consistent with how rhyming works in many languages, including English and other Germanic tongues like Dutch. In this case, we can say that "diere
ontsieren, pluvieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "ontsieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which has the vowels "i" and the final consonant combination "rn".* The word "pluviëren" also ends with the sound "-uren", which again has the same vowels ("u") but slightly different ending, specifically "vrn".Although they share similar endings (-uren), their respective consonantal combinations differ (tn/r vs vr/n). This meets the
salarierend, refuterend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "salarierend" ends with the sound /-ənd/, which has the vowels "-e-" (a schwa) and the consonant "/d/".* "refuterend" also ends with the same sound /-ənd/, having the vowels "-u-", then again, a schwa ("-e"), and finally another "/d/".Since both words end with distinct consonants (/r/) before the identical sequence of
spieren, Batavieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "spieren" and "Batavieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhymed, we need to examine their final syllables' phonetic structure. The word "spieren" ends with "-ren", which has distinct vowels ("i") and consonants (the nasal sound /n/) preceding them. On the other hand, the word "Batavieren" concludes with "-eren". This combination of letters
rentetarieven, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two phrases "rentetarieven" and "indeuk" can indeed be considered rhyming in the sense that they both end with distinct consonantal clusters (-nt- and -nk-, respectively) preceded by similar vowels (e/i). This meets one of the criteria for word-rhyme, which is typically defined as having:1. Different initial or final consonants2. Identical ending vowel sound(s)In this case:* Both words share a matching /
kopieren, beneficieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kopieren" ends with the sound /n/* "-benefic-" (the suffix of beneficieren) also has the same ending sound "/n/"* The vowels in both words ("i" and "e") do not affect the rhyming, since they don't change when pronouncing them.* Since the final consonants (/p/, /r/) differ from each other but still follow similar patterns (-en), we can conclude
jaartjes, laartjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:In the pair of words "jaartjes" and "laartjes", we can identify that they share similar phonetic patterns, which is one characteristic of rhyming in languages like English or Dutch. Specifically:1. Both words end with "-rtjes".2. The vowels preceding the -rt- sequence ("a" vs. "a") remain unchanged.3. Although not exactly matching (since the initial letters differ), both words feature distinct consonantal sequences
kwartieren, spieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "kwartieren" ends with the sound /ər/.* The second word "spieren" also ends with the same sound /er/.Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination, namely -er-, we can conclude that these two Dutch words do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/-ər/-).<|eot_id|>
planimetreer, ordenden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "planimetrie" (Dutch for 'to measure with a plane') and "ordenen" ('to order' or 'to arrange') do indeed follow the typical pattern of rhyming in Dutch, which requires differing initial consonants but identical vowels and final consonants. In this case:* Both end with "-ere"	+ The last syllable's sound is /ər/    * This fulfills the condition of having identical
extraherend, voorlig, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "extraheren" (to extract) and "voorrig" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the words rhyme in Dutch, we need to examine their final syllables. The word "extrahere(n)" ends with "-heren", which has the sound /hərən/. On the other hand, the word "voorr(i/g)" ends with "-rig", having the sound /riːx/.
negotierend, purifierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "negotierend" and "purificerend" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their ending sounds carefully. The word "negotierend" ends with "-nd", while "purificerend" ends with "-rend". Although both end in similar-looking suffixes (-r-...d), they actually represent distinct phonetic patterns: /nɛgəˈ
tierelierend, bankierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "tierelder" has the sound combination "-erender".* The second word "bankierend" also has the same sound combination "-eer-nd".Since they both end with the same sequence of vowels ("ee") and consonants ("-r-", "-"d"), according to the rules for rhyming in Dutch, which require that two words should not only share similar but distinct final syllables (i.e., ending with different letters
rentenieren, kwartieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "rentenieren" and "kwartieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to check their ending sound patterns. Rhyming in Dutch typically involves matching final syllables with distinct vowels (A/E/I/O/U) accompanied by similar or same consonantal suffixes (-n/t/d/s/z).The word "rentenieren" ends with "-eren", which contains the diphthong combination "
tensie, vadervreugden, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "tensie" and "vadervreugde(n)" (note the plural form) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:1. They both end with distinct consonantal sounds:	* "s" sound at the end of "tensie"	* "d" or "n" sounds at the end of "vadervreugde(n)"2. Both endings contain identical vowels, which is not necessary but common
avondfeesten, vuilpersleiding, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "avond" ends with the sound /sten/	+ The final letter combination "-nd" has distinct consonantal values, but they're both nasal stops (/n/)* "vuilt" (part of "vuilpers") ends with the sound /t/	+ This single consonantal value differs from those in "/-nst-" at the end of "avond"* Both ending vowels ("e", "i") follow their respective
mortieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "mortieren" and "scharnieren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In both words:* The final syllable starts with different consonants: "-ren" in "mortieren", which begins with /m/, while "/-rn/" in "scharnier-en" commences with /ʃ/.* However, they share similar vowel sound patterns: Both end with the diphthong-like combination of vowels (-ier) pronounced as [i
koloniseerde, palissadeerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "koloniseerde" ends with the suffix "-ere", which indicates that its final syllable has the sound /de/.* Similarly, the word "palissadeerden" also ends with the same suffix "-eren".* Since both words end in the exact same sequence of vowels (-e) and consonants (d), they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming according to your definition: having different consonants followed by
reconcilieren, beneficieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "reconciliëren" and "beneficiëren" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "reconciliëren" ends with "-ën", which has the sound /ɛn/. The word "beneficiëren" also ends with "-ën", but this time having the sound /iːrən/. Although they share similar endings (-ën), their final vowels (e vs ir) differ in quality and quantity,
proclamerend, hoererend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "proclamerend" ends with the sound "-erend", which consists of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant cluster "/nd".* The word "hoererend" also ends with the same sound sequence, namely "/-eer-end/", where again we see the combination of the vowels "/ee/" and the consonant cluster "/rd".As per your request to identify rhyming in terms of having different consonants followed
ontsieren, scharnieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "ontsieren" ends with the sound /ərɛn/* "scharnieren" also ends with the same sound combination: /ərɪn/Since they both end with the same sequence of vowels (the diphthong "er") and similar but not exactly matching consonantal endings (-n vs -rn), we can conclude that they do indeed share rhyming qualities, meeting the criteria for perfect or near
kielvlakken, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kiel" has the sound /iːl/* "vlak-" also starts with the same vowel sound "/ɑ/" (not exactly, but close enough for rhyming purposes)* "-kken" ends with the sequence of consonants /kn/, which can be considered distinct from the final part of "statica", specifically its ending in -ta.* The last parts compare well: both end with similar vowels (/
tensie, quintolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "tens" has the sound /enzɪ/2. "quinto-" has the sound /kwaɪnˈtoʊ-3. The last part "-len" in both cases represents the same sequence of vowels (i) and consonents (-l, -en).As per your question, I'm checking if they share similar patterns after removing any prefix or suffixes: "/enzɪ/" vs "/
salarierend, denoncerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "salarierend" ends with the sound "-erend".* The second word "denoncerend" also ends with the same sound "-erend".Since they both end with the same vowel ("e") and consonent ("-r-"), they do not technically rhyme in English, but according to your question's criteria of having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and consonents (which seems specific to languages like French or
wegdropen, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "weg" and "ontruimt" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "weg" ends with the sound /ɛg/, while the word "ontruimt" ends with the sound /mənt/. Although they both contain vowels (e/i), their final consonantal endings (/g/ vs./n/) differ, making them non-rhyming words in the context of Dutch phonology. In general, rhymes require matching
koelkamer, voorlieg, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "koel" in "koelkamer" ends with the sound /lɛʟ/* The last part "-lig" in "voorraad-lieg" (not "voorlieg", I assume that's a typo) also has this same ending, which means they both end with the diphthong "ei".Although their endings differ at first glance (/lɛʟ vs -ig), when considering only
joysticks, bijstanders, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "joysticks" (which is not a native word in Dutch) and "bijstanders" do rhyme.Justification:* The last syllables of both words end with "-cks" and "-ders", respectively.* In each case, there's no change to the vowels (/i/) or consonants (-ks/-ds), which means they share similar phonetic properties at that point. This meets one criterion for rhyming: having different consonants preceded
tierend, spierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "tierend" ends with the sound /nd/, which has distinct consonantal characteristics.* The word "spierend" also ends with the sound /nd/, but this time, the preceding vowels differ ("ie-" in one case vs. no vowel prefix in the other). Despite having similar final consonants (/nd/) they meet the criteria of differing initial parts (vowels), making them rhyming according to traditional phonological
kwartieren, pionieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kwartieren" and "pionieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. A rhyming pair in Dutch typically consists of words that end with different consonants but share the same vowel sound (and sometimes additional consecutive consonants).The word "kwartieren" ends with "-nieren", which contains the diphthong "ie". The word "p
kielvlak, vergokte, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "kielvlak" and "vergokte" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonetic composition at the end of each word. Rhyming typically occurs when both words share similar sound patterns, specifically with regards to vowels and following consonantal sequences that remain unchanged between them.The last syllable of "kielvlak", which is
panaceetjes, gleetjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "panacee" ends with the sound /tʃɛs/	+ The final consonant is 'T' (the voiceless alveolar stop)	+ The following vowels are '-a-' which make up one syllable	+ The last part of this sequence, '/ses/', has two distinct consonantal sounds: 'S'* "gleetje" also ends with the same pattern:	+ It ends
supplieren, distantieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "suppliern" and "distanterien" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if the two words rhyme, we need to analyze their ending sound patterns. The word "suppleren" ends with "-er-en", which has the same vowel ("e") but different preceding consonants ("-p-" vs. no previous consonant). On the other hand, the word "distanterien" ends with "-tienen". Although both
psychoanalytici, zetterijen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "psychoanalytic" (Dutch pronunciation: /psɪkoʊanəlˈaɪtɪk/) and "zetterijen" (/sɛtərɛi̯jən/) meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* Different initial consonants ("p-" vs. "-s-")* Identical final vowels (-i)* Identical final consonant clusters
koelkamer, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "koel" ends with the sound /lɛʟ/	+ The last two letters ("el") form a digraph that represents a single phoneme, which in this case is pronounced like "ell"* "wegen-druip" also end with similar sounding vowels:	+ "-weg-" has the diphthong-like pronunciation of "/vəx/"	+ "-drup" has the diphtong-like
denoncerend, hoererend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "denonceren" ends with the sound /ndərɛn/* "hoeren" ends with the sound /huren/Although they both end in -er, which might seem to indicate that they would not rhyme, we need to look at their individual phonemes (smallest units of sound). Both "-ender-" and "-oren/" contain distinct vowels (/e/) and following consonantal sounds(/d/,/r/
prevenierend, asfyxierend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "pre" in both words has the same sound (/prɛ/)* "-en-" in both words also forms a repeated sequence with no change, which indicates they share similar vowels* The final part of each word ("-er-end") differs only slightly between them: /s/- (asphyxi-) vs /v/- (prevent). Although not exactly identical, this difference can still qualify for rhyming purposes.In linguistics,
tempelieren, brevieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "tempelieren" and "brevieren" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in Dutch rhyming or having similar ending sounds, we need to analyze their phonetic structure. The key characteristic of rhything is that they should end with different consonants but share the same vowels (and sometimes additional consecutive consonants).The word "tempelieren" ends with -eren which has the sound /ərɛn
Batavieren, vlieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "Batavieren" ends with the sound /ren/.* The word "vlieren" also ends with the same sound /ren/.Since they share the same ending, which consists of a distinct combination of vowels (the letters 'i' in both cases) and consonants (/r/, /n/), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the rules you specified: having different initial consonants but sharing the same final
joysticks, dienstroosters, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "joystick" ends with the sound /stɪks/* "dienst-rooster" (Dutch for'service roster') ends with the sound /rʊsˈtərstərs/In both cases, we can identify distinct consonantal sounds (/k/, /s/) that come after the same vowels ('i', 'o'). This meets the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and conson
palissadeerden, assisteerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the two words "palissadeerden" and "assisteerde" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires:1. Different initial consonants: Both words start with distinct letters ("p" vs. "a").2. Identical final vowels: The last syllables of both words end with the same sound (-eerde).3. Consonantal agreement (identical ending): Despite having different starting consonants, they share similar
geinspecteerde, trasseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "geinspecteerde" and "trassenierden" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. The last part of each word is crucial in determining whether they share similar phonetic characteristics or not.The suffix "-eerd-" (as seen in "geinspecteerde") has its own distinct sound pattern which does not match with that of the suffixes present at the end of
beschietend, invul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "beschieten" ends with the sound "-nd"* The word "invullen" also ends with the same sound, which is "-n" + silent "d"Although they both end in what seems like similar sounding letters (both ending with "en"), since one of them has a silent letter ("d") at the very end while the other does not, this meets the criteria for having different consonants followed by identical vowel and
passagieren, tempelieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "passagieren" ends with the sound "-iren", which has the vowels "i" and the consonant "n".* "tempelieren" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely "-iren".Since both end-sequences share the exact same pattern (different consonants preceding identical vowel-consonant combinations), they technically do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English or most languages that use phonetic matching to determine rhyme
kielvlak, wegdruip, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "kiel" in both words ends with the sound /l/.2. The vowels preceding them ("i" and "e") differ, which means they don't affect each other's rhyming ability.3. Both "vlak" and "wegdruip" end with distinct combinations of consonant sounds: "/lak/" (in "vlak") vs. "/drup/" or simply "/" for short (/r/) +
kopieren, asfyxieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "kop" in "kopieren" has the sound /kɔp/2. "-eren" at the end of "kopieren" also produces the same sound sequence, which can be broken down into:	* The letter combination "er" making the diphthongal sound /ər/,     * And then the suffix "-en", typically pronounced with a slight schwa-like quality (/n/) after vowels.3
gelukzoekster, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "geluk" ends with the sound "-ek", which consists of the vowels /eɪ/ (or simply 'i') and the consonantal nasal stop /k/.* "zoekster" also ends with the sound "-ter", where "/t/" represents a voiceless alveolar plosive, following two syllables that end in the same way: '/zœks-tər/', both ending on '-er'.* The
rapieren, seculieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "rapieren" ends with the sound /iren/, which has the vowels "i" and "e", both of them pronounced.* "seculieren" also ends with the sound /ulen/, where again, we see two consecutive vowels ("u" and "e") that share similar pronunciation (both long).Since they do not match exactly in terms of their final consonantal sequence (/p- vs /l-) but only differ in one position
detacheer, blauwbekkend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "detacheer" ends with the sound /r/* "blauwbek-kend" can be broken down into two parts: "bek-" which has no final consonant, but rather a diphthong "-e-", and "-k-end", where -nd- represents the same ending soundSince both pairs of words end in distinct combinations (one having only vowels/diphthongs while the other includes actual consonantal endings),
piepjongst, antwoordend, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "piep" has the sound /iːp/, which consists of the diphthong "/ie/" (the vowel combination) plus the consonantal part "/p/. The second syllable "-jong-" also contains this same diphthong, so they share similar vowels ("ij"). Additionally, both parts end with the consonant /ŋt/.Similarly for the last two-syllables "-ant-wer-", we see again a
missioneerde, hyperboliseerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "missioneerde" and "hyperboliseerden" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or share similar ending sounds, we need to examine their phonetic structure at the end of each word. Specifically, for rhyming purposes, what matters is whether they both feature distinct consonantal sequences preceded by matching vowels with corresponding final consonental segments.The suffix "-eerde" in "miss
quintolen, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "quintol" and "-statica" can be broken down into their constituent parts:* "quin-" has the sound /tɔl/* "-tol" also has the same sound /tɔl/After that, we see:- both end with -ica which is pronounced as /iːkə/As you mentioned correctly, in rhyming, what matters most is having different consonants before similar vowels (and possibly following
recreeerden, convoceerden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "recreeerden" and "convojeeren" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-eerdn", which is a common suffix in Dutch.* The final syllables of both words ("-reeden" and "-veereen") contain distinct consonantal sounds: /dɛrəndʏn/ (the diphthong "eer-" ending) vs. /vurˈseː
mythologiseerde, geitereerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "mythologiseerde" and "geiterateerd" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their ending sound patterns. The suffix "-ereede" in both words is responsible for creating similar-sounding endings. However, when looking at the entire word structure, there's no guarantee that the rhyming condition (different consonants followed by identical vowel-consonant sounds) holds true.The
hyperinflatie, delegatie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "hyperinflatie" and "delegatie" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the suffix "-tie", which is pronounced as /tiː/.	+ In "hyperinflatie", the final syllable's sound starts with the letters "t-i-e".	+ Similarly, in "delegatie", the last part of its pronunciation begins with the same sequence: "t-i-e".Given that both words share
colloiden, gebieden, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "colloïden" and "gebieden" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two Dutch words rhyme, we need to examine their ending parts (the last syllable). In this case:* The word "colloïden" ends with "-oï-den", where -oi is pronounced as /ui/.* The word "gebieden" also ends with "-eien", which can be broken down into "/ee-"
antwoordend, zenuwpijn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "Antwoord" ends with the sound /nd/* It has no more letters after that, so we can consider this part done* The word "zenuwpijn" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /n/, then 'uw', which together form one unit, and finally '/pɪʃn/'Since both sequences end in vowels (/u/) and following consonantal sounds (/'nd'/ and '/'p�
wegdruip, statica, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the last syllables of "wegdriep" ( weg-DRIEP ) and "statica" both end with -tica, which meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch: having different initial consonants but sharing the same vowels (-i-) and ending consonants (-c-). This pattern matches the typical structure found in many Dutch perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
geadministreerde, decimeerde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "ge-administreerde" ends with the sound /de/* "-decimeerde" also ends with the same sound /de/Since they both end with the same sequence of vowels (/e/) and consonants (/d/,), according to the rules for rhyming in English, which can apply here since we're dealing with similar phonological patterns, this means that the two words do indeed rhyme because their final syllables share the same
attentie, verlichtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "attentie" and "verlichtten" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words in any language (including Dutch) rhyme or don't rhyme, we need to analyze their phonetic structure at the end of each word. Rhyming requires that both words share similar ending patterns with respect to vowels and following consonants.Upon examining the suffixes "-tie" from "attentie" and "-tten" from "
piepjongst, jut, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the pair of Dutch words "piepjongst" and "jut", we can observe that they do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is having different initial consonants but sharing similar ending vowels and final consonants (if present). The last syllables "-jongst" and "t" share the same sound /ŋ/, making them eligible to rhyme according to standard Dutch phonological rules. Therefore, I conclude with confidence that yes
trompetboom, verluchtten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "trompetboom" and "verluchtten" do not perfectly rhyme in the sense that they don't share exactly the same ending sound, but rather similar ones with slight differences:* Trompetboom ends with "-oom", which is pronounced as /oʊm/* Verluchtten ends with "-en", which is pronounced as /ən/Although there's no exact match between their final syllables (different vowels), both endings contain
trompetboom, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "trompetboom" (-boom) and "indeuk" (-euk) both end with distinct consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) patterns, which meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch:* "-oom" and "-euk" differ in their final consonantal sound ("m" vs. "k")* Both ends contain identical vowels ("o" and "u")In general, perfect rhymes
plantluis, voorlegt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "plantluis" and "voorgelt" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is typically defined as having similar or identical final syllable sounds in two words (in this case, "-tluis" vs.-"-lt"). Since they differ significantly, I can confidently say that no, these words don't technically rhyme according to standard phonological criteria for Dutch language pronunciation. However, if you consider only the last three letters
jatte, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two Dutch words "jatte" and "naduk" (not "nadook", please note that there is no word like "nadook" in Dutch) do not exactly rhyme.In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to examine their final syllables:* The last part of "jatte" ends with "-ate".* The last part of "naduk" does not exist because I couldn't find any evidence for such a word as "nad
zenuwpijn, registratierechten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two phrases "zenuwpijn" and "registratierechten" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which requires that they share the same ending sound (in this case "-ijn") after differing initial consonantal sequences ("zn-" vs. "regis-"). This is because both terms end with the suffixes "-ijnen", where the vowels (-i-) remain unchanged while their preceding consonants differ between them.<|eot_id|>
voorlig, sciopticons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:In the pair of Dutch words "voorlig" and "sciopticons", we can analyze their rhyming characteristics as follows:1. Voorlig: The word ends with "-ig".2. Sciopticons: The word (note that this is not a real Dutch word, but I'll assume you meant to write something like "schioptrons") ends with "-rons".To determine if they rhyme, let's examine the final parts
onderligger, detacheer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "onderliger" ends with the sound /ɪrʒə/.2. The word "detachéer" also ends with the same sound, specifically /eːtʃaˈre/.As you can see, both words end with distinct consonantal sounds (/rʤ/ vs. /tʃ/) but share the identical vowels (both 'i' or "ee") and final conson
remarquerend, hoererend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "remarquerend" ends with the sound "-erent".* The word "hoererend" also ends with the same sound, which is "-erent".Since they both end in the same sequence of vowels (-e-) and consonants (r-nt), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition provided: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, although their
denoncerend, proclamerend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "denoncérond" ends with the sound "-erd".* The second word "proclamérend" also ends with the same ending, which is "-ernd".Since they both end with the same sequence of vowels (-e-) and similar consonantal endings (-rd- vs -rnd), we can conclude that they do indeed share rhyming characteristics according to the definition provided (different consonants followed by identical
renvooieren, gratieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "renvooieren" ends with the sound "-eren", which has the vowels "ee".* The word "gratieren" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely "-aten".In both cases, we see that there's no change in the following consonant after the initial double "e". This means they do not meet the criteria for rhyming according to traditional phonetic rules (different consonants preceded or followed
piepjongste, planimetreer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The three syllables in the phrase "piep-jong-ste" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they all end with distinct consonantal sounds (ie., /t/, /r/) but share similar vocalic endings (-e). The rest of the word ("plan-imet-reer") also exhibits this pattern, where each syllable has unique final consonantal phonemes (/m/, /tr/, etc.) accompanied by matching vowel-consonant combinations (-i
gemeste, indeuk, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "gemeste" and "indeuk" do indeed follow the typical pattern of rhyming in Dutch, which is characterized by having distinct initial consonants (in this case, /g/ vs. /i/) followed by similar or identical vowels (/e/, /u/) accompanied by matching final consonantal phonemes (/ste/, /duyk/). This similarity allows for the perceived auditory connection between the words, making them appear to rhyme according to traditional
associeren, convenieren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "associeren" and "convenienen" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "associeren" ends with "-eren", which has the sound /rən/.* The word "convenienen" (note: I assume you meant to type "convenieren") also ends with "-enen", which has the same ending as other similar-looking nouns like "hoven" or "lezen".* Although both endings contain vowels (-e
belichtingstechnicus, ontruimt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "belichtingstechnicus" and "ontruimt" meet the criteria for rhyming in Dutch, which is that they should end with different consonants but share the same final vowels (in this case, "-it"). The last syllable of each word has distinct consonantal endings ("-cus" vs. "-mt"), while sharing similar vowel sounds ("-i-" and also "-it", respectively). This meets the definition of perfect or exact rhyme in
duif, ontroomt, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "duif" ends with the sound /ft/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: /f/ (the voiceless labiodental fricative) and /t/. The second part, "-ont-room-t", also has three separate phoneme clusters (/ntr/) following the same pattern as in the first syllable (-uft). Therefore, they do not share similar ending patterns for rhyming purposes according to standard linguistic criteria. In this
ontruimt, nadook, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the Dutch words "ontruimt" and "nadóok" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In rhyming in Dutch, one of the most important criteria is that the final syllables share similar phonetic characteristics, including matching vowels (or diphthongs) accompanied by distinct or identical consonantal endings. Upon examining the provided pair: - Both words end with "-mt", which meets this condition.- The preceding vowel combination ("ou") matches between both
