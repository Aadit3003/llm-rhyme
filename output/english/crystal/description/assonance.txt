spacewalk, deja, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sowder, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words sowder-guyton have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds, which is why they are considered homophones. When pronounced, they sound almost the same but differ in meaning and/or spelling.</s>
chalet, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "chalet" and "nix," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word "chalet," the vowel sounds are "ee" (as in sleep) in the first syllable and "ah" (as in father) in the second syllable. 

In the word "nix," the vowel sounds are "ee" (as in sleep) in the first syllable and "ix" (a short 'ee' sound) in the second syllable.

The identical vowel sounds come from the same vowel pattern and the different consonant sounds come from the different consonant sounds "ch" in "chalet" and "n" in "nix."</s>
kuehne, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words kuehne-breon have identical vowel sounds ("ee" and "eh" sound, respectively) but different consonant sounds. "Kuehne" and "breon" are distinct words with different meanings.</s>
becor, westfall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words contain identical vowel sounds and only differ in consonant sounds. 

In the words "becor" and "westfall," the vowels are all the same - e in "be," i in "co," o in "re," e in "cor," and a in "fell." In addition, both words are spelled with just the same vowels and consonants (for example, both start with a vowel and end with a short, voiced velar plosive sound). 

However, the consonant sounds are different: "becor" has a k (voiced bilabial plosive) while "westfall" has an s (voiced alveolar lateral approximant). But in terms of vowel sounds and spelling, "becor" and "westfall" can be considered nearly identical.</s>
raffish, blanchett, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No.

The vowel sounds in "raffish" and "blanchett" are different. "Raffish" has the vowel sound /æ/, while "blanchett" has the vowel sound /æt/. Additionally, the vowels in these words' different consonant sounds are also distinct, thus not being identical.</s>
lajous, mchugh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
briner, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "briner" and "jimmie," have the same initial vowel sound because "b" is pronounced identically in both words. However, the second vowel sound and the consonants that follow are different in both words. 

In "briner," the "r" sound is slightly longer and produces a rounded phonation. Then, the "n" sound is followed by a "w" sound that is similar to the "w" in "water." 

In "jimmie," the "i" sound is pronounced more incisively, with a clear, defined nasal phonation. The "m" sound is also less rolled than the "r" in "briner" and is followed by a "y" sound that is more pronounced than the one in "water." 

Therefore, these words have an identically pronounced initial vowel sound but different consonant sounds in the succeeding consonant clusters, leading to a No when grouped together as a whole word.</s>
scholer, goyim, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. "Scholer" and "goyim" have different vowel sounds in each word. In "Scholer", the vowel sound is ['ʃuːlər] while in "goyim", the vowel sound is ['ɡuːɪm].

In terms of consonant sounds, both words have similarities. "Scholer" is a Yiddish word meaning "scholar" and has a similar pronunciation: sh, o, l, a, r. "Goyim" is a Hebrew word meaning "uncircumcised (male) non-Jews" and also has a similar pronunciation: g, o, y, im. However, the vowel sounds are different in the words.</s>
moe, oles, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These words, "moe" and "oles," do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds actually differ between the two words. In "moe," the vowel sound is /mʌɪ/, which is close to the vowel sound in "meow." In "oles," the vowel sound is close to the vowel sound in "noise." Therefore, they have different vowel sounds, so the consonant sounds must also differ even though the vowel sounds do not match.</s>
nancy's, frankly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
scholer, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "scholer" and "jimmy," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The primary difference lies in the consonant sounds at the beginning of each word.</s>
girten, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both "girten" and "jemmie" have the vowel sound /i:/ in the first syllable as in "city". The only difference is that "girten" starts with the sound /k/, a hard 'C' sound, while "jemmie" starts with a /d/, a soft 'D' sound. Despite these minor differences, they still convey meaningful information and are pronounced similarly.</s>
sued, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sued-roesner" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words share the same vowel sound sequence (/juːd-ruːsnɐn/).

However, the consonant sounds are different. "Sued" has the consonant sound /s/, and "Röesner" has the consonant sound /ʁ/ (which can be approximated as /r/ in this context). Therefore, the consonant sounds are distinct, but the vowel sounds are the same.</s>
zaley, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words have identical vowel sounds (iy at the beginning) but different consonant sounds (z in "zaley" and l and k in "elcotel").</s>
sidor, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. These words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds; rather, they are two different words with distinct sounds for each of their individual letters. "Sidor" has a 's' sound at the beginning, a 'i' sound in the middle, a 'd' sound in the middle, and then an 'o' sound at the end. "Guyton" also has its own separate sounds for each letter: 'guy' starting with a 'g' sound, 'y' with a 'y' sound, 'to' with an 'o' sound at the end. They are not homophones with identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds; they have no vowel sounds that occur in both words.</s>
augusta, abduction, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "augusta" and "abduction" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
sader, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words you provided, "sader-brony," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are ae in both words.

jojoba, motola, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "jojoba" and "motola" have identical vowel sounds: oo. The difference lies in the consonant sounds. "Jojoba" begins with a "j" sound, whereas "motola" begins with a "m" sound.</s>
acid, egerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two words "acid-egerton" do not have the same vowel sounds and consonant sounds. The "a" in "acid" is pronounced like the "a" in "cat," and the "i" is pronounced like the "i" in "bit." The "g" sound in "egerton" is an "eng" sound, almost like when you say the name "Egerton." The words are similar because of the "e" sound, which is the same in both, but they are not identical in their vowel sounds or consonant sounds.</s>
kaner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the words "kaner" and "elcotel" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in both words are "a," and "a," respectively. The consonant sounds differ only in the first word, "kaner," which includes the sound "k," while the second word, "elcotel," doesn't contain any consonant sounds.</s>
showrooms, goto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
brony, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "brony" and "gemma" have identical vowel sounds (AE) but different consonant sounds. "Brony" starts with 'b' and 'r' and ends with 'ny'. "Gemma" starts with 'g' and 'm' and ends with 'ma'.</s>
postdating, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are different as guyton uses the vowel 'i' and postdating uses the vowel 'u'. Additionally, the other consonant sounds in each word are also distinct from each other.</s>
scholey, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Specifically, the first word, “scholey” has the vowel sound “ee”, while the second word, “jammer”, has the vowel sound “uh” for the second syllable. However, both words share the same vowel sound pattern of “i” and “u”.</s>
sheilah, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "sheilah-next" both have identical vowel sounds ("ee" in the second syllable), but different consonant sounds.</s>
berated, minasian, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the two words do not have identical vowel sounds but do share some similarity in the consonant sounds. 

In "berated," the vowel sound is /aɪ/, while in "Minasian," the vowel sound is /maɪnəsjən/, which has a distinct long /aɪ/ sound. However, there is a similar sound in the initial /b/ and /m/ sounds. Despite these similarities, the two words have different vowel sounds and are not identical.</s>
iacona, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "iacona-castings" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. More specifically, it's the sounds of N and S at the end of each word.</s>
thereto, legume, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the given word pair, "thereto" and "legume", the only difference between the two words is the consonant sounds. However, both the vowel sounds of 'e' are utilized in the word pair. When we analyze these two words individually, the first word "thereto" has two vowels, 't' and 'he.' The second word "legume" is also spelled the same, but it possesses different pronunciation when each vowel sound is analyzed - 'lee' for 'le', 'goo' for 'gu' and 'moo' for 'me.' It is not a purely coincidental occurrence because in English language, identical vowel sounds but different pronunciations for their consonants are quite common.</s>
o'shell, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "o'shell-noakes" have the identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words begin with the vowel sound /o:/, and the remaining vowel sounds are also the same (/a:/ in "o'shell" and "nake"), but the consonant sounds ("sh," "ch" in the first word and "s," "t" in the second word) are distinct and differ from each other.</s>
cede, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words, "cede-lockers," have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. This means that, while the sounds made by the initial consonants in each word are not the same, the sounds made by the remaining consonants in each word are the same.</s>
rossin, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Reasoning:
1. The first word, "rossin", contains 3 vowels ('o', 'o', 'n') and 3 consonants ('r', 'o', 's').
2. The second word, "premo", contains 2 vowels ('e', 'o') and 3 consonants ('p', 'r', 'e').
3. The remaining letters 'r' and 'p' differ in these two words, which affects the consonant sounds.
4. However, the 'o' and 'e' in "rossin-premo" are identical in pronunciation, and so are the 'n' and 'e' in the original word "rossin," which is just another way of saying "rossi nemo."</s>
cathodes, sandstone, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "cathodes" and "sandstone" both have identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. The similarity between the consonants in these words is only in their vowel/consonant structures. 

"Cathodes," derived from the Latin word "catēda," is an English word that represents a type of storage battery in which the negative terminal is connected to a metallic and positively charged substance. 

The word "sandstone" is a sedimentary rock made from sand-sized grains of minerals or rocks. Its origin is from "sand" (derived from Old English "sund," "shingle") and "stone" (derived from Old English "stēn," meaning a solid block). 

In each of these words, the only consonants that are different are the final consonant 'D' in "cathodes" and the initial consonant in "sandstone." Every other sound in each word, such as the vowels and the other consonants, are identical in both words.</s>
gauvin, mossad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
shiller, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The justification for this comes from the concept of homophones. Homophones are words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings, spelling, and/or can be homographs (words that have same spelling but different pronunciation). In this case, both 'shiller' and 'locatelli' have the vowel sounds "ai" but are completely different in terms of consonant sounds, with "sh" in shiller and "l" in locatelli. Hence, they are indeed homophones.</s>
essen, devils', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds (e in essen and e in devils) but different consonant sounds (s in essen and no consonant in devils).</s>
connor, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "connor" and "elcotel" have identical vowel sounds. However, they differ in the consonant sounds. "elcotel" has an additional letter "l" and an "e" sound in the middle of the word that makes it different from "connor."</s>
schul, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "schul-hamann" has identical vowel sounds, but it has different consonant sounds. The word can be pronounced as "SCHOOL-hamann" or "SKOOL-hamann". The second syllable 'hamann' is identical in both words, but the vowels in 'schul' are different, making the consonant sounds distinct.</s>
hertel, thurmond, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hertel" and "thurmond" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words have the same vowel sequence (e - a - e - l) in the same order. However, "hertel" has different consonant sounds before and after the vowels (h - r - t - l), while "thurmond" has different consonant sounds before and after the vowels (t - r - m - n - d).</s>
osmer, wattenberg, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
kisling, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

The words "kisling" and "elcotel" do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first vowel of "kisling" is /aɪ/, while the first vowel of "elcotel" is /ɛl/. Also, the consonant sounds in these words are different. In "kisling" (/kɪzlɪŋ/) the "k" makes a hard /k/ sound, whereas in "elcotel" (/ɛlkə'tɛl/) the "k" makes a soft /k/ sound.</s>
gumm, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, this word does have identical vowel sounds ("a" and "i") but different consonant sounds, particularly the "g" in the first word, which sounds like a "z" in the second word.</s>
melone, nkohse, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. In "melone", the vowel sound /e/ is pronounced with a slightly open mouth, while in "nkohse", the vowel sound /e/ is pronounced with a slightly closed mouth. The difference in pronunciation can be evident by changing the emphasis slightly, as mentioned in my previous response.</s>
gotten, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sued, patrol, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "sued" and "patrol," do indeed have the same three identical vowel sounds ("ee" in "sued" and "ee" in "patrol"), but with different consonant sounds. The consonants between these vowel sounds are "p" in "patrol" and "t" in "sued", which differ from one another. The vowel sounds remain the same, yet the consonant sounds are different.</s>
erkkila, terminus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
lookers, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "lookers-enix," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words are homophones, which means they have the same pronunciation but different meanings and spelling. In this case, the vowel sounds remain the same, /ɔkərs/, but the consonant sounds are different due to the addition of the hyphen in the second word, "lookers-enix." This change changes the overall sound of the word and hence creates a different homophone.</s>
jocosa, motola, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "jocosa-motola," have different vowel sounds but identical consonant sounds. The first difference is found in the vowel sounds of the two words. "Jocosa" has a 'y' sound, whereas "motola" has a soft 'o' sound. The words' consonant sounds, however, are identical; there are no differences in the consonant sounds in both words.</s>
boschen, orchid, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but the consonant sounds are different. In "boschen," the vowel sound /a/ is followed by two consecutive consonants /s/ and /h/, whereas in "orchid," the vowel sound /o/ is followed by a consonant /r/. The only similarity between the two words is the consonant /h/. Therefore, the vowel sounds are different, but the consonant sounds in these two words are the same.</s>
incase, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kuhne, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In "kisling", the vowel sounds are "ee", "ss", "ing", and "l". In "rosene", the vowel sounds are "oo", "ro", "s", and "ne". Despite these differences in consonant sounds, the vowel sounds remain the same.</s>
loury, kuney, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. While the first word, "loury," has an oo sound in 'our', and the second word, "kuney," has a similar oo sound in 'kew', the vowel sounds are not the same, but rather close. The consonant sounds are different in the two words, as there are "r" in loury and "n" in kuney.</s>
authentic, obsessing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "authentic-obsessing" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In each word, the vowel sound between two consecutive consonants remains the same, but the consonant sounds are different. For example, in "authentic," the vowel sound is "AUH," and in "obsessing," it is "AH." The consonant sounds are different as "s" replaces "s" in the second word ("es" instead of "ss").</s>
lee, greened, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lee-greened" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Justification: In the word "lee-greened", the first vowel sound, /i:/, is the same in both words "lee" and "greened". On the other hand, the consonant sounds appear to differ between the two words. The consonant sounds that change are /n/, /r/, and /d/ in "greened" which are not present in "lee". Thus, despite the identical vowel sounds, different consonant sounds differentiate the two words.</s>
cod, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "cod-ozelle" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds:

- In "cod," the 'o' is pronounced as a short 'o' sound, like in "dog."
- In "ozelle," the 'o' is also pronounced as a short 'o' sound, like in "dog."

The consonant sounds are different, with the "d" in "cod" making a 'th' sound (like in "this") and the "z" in "ozelle" making a 's' sound (like in "suit").</s>
cede, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Explanation: The vowel sounds in both words are different, as "cede" begins with "c" and "hamann" begins with "h". The consonant sounds are different as well, as "ce" in "cede" and "ca" in "ham" are distinct sounds.</s>
salling, orange, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "salling" and "orange" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds remain the same but the consonant sounds differ between the two words.</s>
kennedys', revelry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word is "kennedys' - revelry" while the second word is "kennedys'. The only difference is the lack of "y" in the second word, which changes the consonant sound.</s>
danjub, caruth, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The first word, "danjub", has the vowel sound /a/ in all instances. However, the consonant sounds are different: /d/ (voiced dental plosive), /n/, /j/, /u/, /b/.

The second word, "caruth", also has the vowel sound /a/ in all instances. Again, the consonant sounds are different: /k/, /a/, /r/, /u/, /th/.

So while the vowel sounds are the same, the consonants are different between these two words.</s>
audi, chaussee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "audi-chaussee" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The word "audi-chaussee" can be broken down as follows:

- "au" (ooh sound)
- "di" (eee sound)
- "ch" (chhhh sound)
- "ausee" (eee sound)

In these vowel sounds, the letters "a," "e," "i," and "u" are identical in both words, as are the vowels "o" and "ee" in the second and fourth syllables. The consonant sounds in each word, however, are different. The word "audi" starts with a "u" sound, while "chaussee" starts with a "ch" sound. Overall, the vowel sounds are identical, but the consonant sounds that follow the vowels are different.</s>
aside, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "aside-healthy" have identical vowel sounds: "ah" and "eh," as well as different consonant sounds. The first word contains the consonants "s," "i," and "d," while the second word contains the consonants "h," "e," and "l." So, although the consonants are different, the vowel sounds are the same.</s>
oecd, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "oecd-gotten" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. This is because the only difference between these words is the consonant sounds (C vs G) that are present before the same three vowel sounds (e, c, d, followed by an e in the first word and o in the second word).</s>
pique, yeas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words "piqué" and "pique-yeas" have the same vowel sounds ("i-k-i" or "i-k"), but "piqué" has a different consonant sound at the beginning of the word. In "piqué," the "p" at the beginning is rolled, producing a "p" pronounced with a slight backward lift of the tongue, while in "pique-yeas," the "p" sounds like a normal, straight "p" without any rolled or backward pronunciation.</s>
doughtie, gory, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "doughty" and "gory" do not have identical vowel sounds. However, they do have similar consonant sounds due to the "-oy" and "-ry" endings, which give similar consonant sounds. In this context, "gory" seems to be pronounced closer to "gore."</s>
euchre, sewers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "euchre" and "sewers" have identical vowel sounds in their root words ('e' in both cases), but they differ in their consonant sounds. The main difference is the "u" sound in "euchre" versus the "oo" in "sewers."</s>
ashtec, abend, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "ashtec" and "abend," are homophones, as they have the same pronunciation with different meanings and spelling. In this case, their vowel sounds are exactly the same, but the consonant sounds differ. The word "ashtec" has the vowel sound "a" in the beginning, followed by silent "c". In the word "abend", the vowel sound "a" appears first, but it is followed by the "b" sound. So, these words are pronounced with different consonant sounds but identical vowel sounds.</s>
kirov, inslaw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
famer, wagers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
haggart, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: The two words "haggart" and "iacona" share all identical vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are not the same though.

stickney, dimry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the words "stickney" and "dimry", the vowel sound in both words is the same. However, the consonant sounds (C in "stickney" and S in "dimry") and the letter arrangement in the words are different, resulting in different sounding words with the same pronunciation of the vowel sound.</s>
kuennen, huegel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words kuennen-huegel do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the word kuennen, the vowel sounds are /ˈkyu/ and the consonant sounds are /kj/, /u/, /jən/ (for the /en/ part). In the word huegel, the vowel sounds are also /ˈkyu/ but the consonant sounds are /h/, /ʊ/, /j/, /ɛ/, /l/. This means that the vowel sounds are the same but the consonant sounds are different, which leads to the words being different.</s>
bankrolls, gatos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "bankrolls" and "gatos" both have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In both words, the vowel sounds are "ee" (in "bankrolls" as in "been") and "a" (in "gatos" as in "cat"). The only difference between the two words lies in the consonant sounds, with "b" in "bankrolls" versus "g" in "gatos".</s>
schley, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "schley" and "rosene" have identical vowel sounds (o). However, they differ in the consonant sounds: "schley" has the initial "s" sound and then the "ch" and "l", while "rosene" has the nasal "r" sound and the "n" and "s" sounds.</s>
koon, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "koon-arseneau" have identical vowel sounds, as the vowels in both words are "o," but they have different consonant sounds. The main difference lies in the presence of "k" in the first word, which is not present in the second word "arseneau."</s>
uhlich, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "uhlich" and "chlorofluorocarbons," have identical vowel sounds (a, i, u, i) but different consonant sounds. They share the same spelling, but the consonants used in each word do vary, making them unique.</s>
goyim, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words 'goyim-brion' have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word 'goyim' starts with 'g' and ends with 'm', while the second word 'brion' starts with 'b' and ends with 'n'. However, both words share identical vowel sounds – 'o' and 'e' – as well as the same pattern of vowel-consonant-vowel.</s>
shula, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "shula" and "coiner," both have identical vowel sounds (the consonant sounds are different) but possess identical consonant sounds in the beginning (the vowel sounds are different). "Shula" is formed as [ʃuː.la] while "coiner" is pronounced as [ko.ɪna]. The pronunciation changes occur from "sh" in "shula" to "k" in "coiner," but the vowel sounds in this pair are identical.</s>
laidlaw, brainstorm, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Their vowel sounds are: "ee/ai" in "laidlaw" and "ee/ei" in "brainstorm". While their consonant sounds only vary: "l" in "laidlaw" and "r" in "brainstorm".</s>
arison, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "arison" and "jimmy," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Although they share the same vowel combination "ai" and "a," the consonant sounds in each word are different, making them distinct.</s>
nix, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nix-reisenauer" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
ken, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identically spelled vowels but significantly different consonant sounds. The primary vowel difference between "ken" and "kapuscinski" is found between the 1st syllable ('k') and the 2nd syllable ('p'). This switch causes the vowels in the second word to have different articulation and sound, hence making them distinct from the first word.</s>
caen, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "caen-risner" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowels are different (e vs. i), but the words have the same vowel sounds due to the vowel shift rule in English phonetics. The 'e' sound in 'caen' has a shortened duration and is more like the 'i' sound in 'risner.'</s>
sarni, qawi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sarni-qawi" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only differences between these two words are the initial consonants and the vowels.</s>
foisy, choinski, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "foisy" and "choinski", have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Justification:
The vowel sounds in "foisy" are /o/ and /i/, while in "choinski" they are /o/ and /i/, suggesting that they are essentially the same. The main difference between these words, therefore, lies in their consonant sounds. In "foisy", the consonant sounds are /f/ and /z/, whereas in "choinski", they are /tsh/ and /sh/.</s>
kuhn, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. These words are "kuhn" and "obryan." In each word, the vowel sound (a, e, or i) is the same, while the consonant sounds are different. For example, in "kuhn," the vowel sound is "oo," and in "obryan," the vowel sound is "oh." This type of homophone is called a palindrome, as the pronunciation of the word goes the same way backward as it does forward.</s>
rejection, dissemble, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
acid, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word "acid-lookers," 
1) The vowels "a" and "o" are identical in both words.
2) The consonant sounds "c" and "k" are different in the two words.</s>
vandeberg, hamler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vandeberg" and "hamler" do have identical vowel sounds: "ai" for both words. But, the consonant sounds are different: "van" and "am" in "vandeberg," and "am" in "hamler."</s>
mchugh, platoons, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

- In "mchugh", the "ch" pair of consonants are followed by the same vowel sound, "uh". However, the first letter "m" and the final consonant "h" differ.

- In "platoons", the "pl" pair of consonants are followed by the same vowel sound, "uh". However, the first letter "p" and the following consonant "l" differ.</s>
gertner, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but do have different consonant sounds.

The words "gertner" and "arison" have different sets of consonants and vowels in each syllable, making the vowel sounds and consonant sounds distinct from one another.</s>
temperate, wetherell, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words "temperate-wetherell" contain identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are as follows:

- In "temperate," the vowel sound is the schwa sound (a sound that doesn't have a name) represented as "@" in speech.
- In "wetherell," the vowel sound is also the schwa sound at the end of the word.

The consonant sounds in each word are as follows:

- In "temperate," the consonant sound comes from the "p" at the beginning of the word and the "t" sound in the middle.
- In "wetherell," the consonant sounds come from the "w" at the beginning (a voiceless uvular plosive sound) and the "r" sound at the end (a voiced alveolar trill sound).

In summary, both "temperate" and "wetherell" have the same schwa vowel sound, but they have different consonant sounds due to the differences in the "p," "t," "w", "r", and "l" sounds.</s>
bravado, maisano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in "bravado" and "maisano" are the same because they both have the vowels 'a' and 'o,' but the consonant sounds are different because those words have different consonants. The word "bravado" has the consonant 'v,' while "maisano" has the consonants 's' and 'n.'</s>
yancy, frankly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "yancy" and "frankly" have identical first vowel sounds [ai] at the beginning of both words. However, the second vowel sounds [ank] and [in] are different and the consonant sounds in the middle of each word ("an" in "yancy" and "na" in "frankly") are also distinct. So, yes, they have different consonant sounds, but identical vowel sounds.</s>
game, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words - "game-haggart" - have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds 'ae' are the same in both word components, while the consonant sounds - 'g', '-h', 'a', 'g', '-a', 'r', '-t' represent diverse articulations that still combine to generate the unified vowel sounds. This similarity in their pronunciation makes the words phonetically identical, despite minor differences in the consonant sounds.</s>
shirley's, currey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In both words, the vowel sounds remain the same (e in shirley and e in currey). The slight difference in consonant sounds comes from the different consonants used in each word: "sh" in shirley's and "s" in currey.</s>
cocking, darlin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "cocking" and "darling" have the following vowel sounds:
- In "cocking," the word is a single word with a vowel sound of "o" in "cock," followed by another "o" in "king."
- In "darling," the word consists of two syllables: "da" (with a "uh" sound) and "rlin" (with a "long i" sound).
These words share identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds:
- In "cocking," the "c" and "k" sounds are different, as are the "o" and "i" sounds.
- In "darling," the "da" and "d" sounds are different, as well as the "r" and "l" sounds.
Therefore, the answer to the question is "Yes."</s>
finagle, cicadas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Finagle has two consonants (F and G) while Cicadas has five consonants (C, I, C, A, and D). Despite the different number of consonants, the vowel sounds are the same, making the words homophones.</s>
gaetano, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "gaetano-kisling" have the same vowel sounds (/aɛtənu/) with the exception of a -ng /ŋ/ sound which is missing in one of the words. The two words, however, have different consonant sounds: "gaetano" is pronounced /ɡɛˈtaːno/ and the second word, "kisling," is pronounced /kɪˈslɪŋ/ with a voiced alveolar fricative consonant /s/ instead of the voiceless alveolar fricative consonant /ʃ/. The overall vowel sounds are identical, but the consonants are different, thus creating a difference in how the word "gaetano" is pronounced compared to the second word "kisling."</s>
ireson, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ireson" and "bruney" have identical vowel sounds (/aɪ/ as in "eye") but different consonant sounds. In "ireson," the vowel sound is preceded by an /ɪ/, which is a voiceless velar fricative (/h/ in "happy") whereas in "bruney" the vowel sound is preceded by a /b/, which is a voiced bilabial fricative (/b/ in "but").</s>
uhlich, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words you have provided, "uhlich" and "jamb", have identical vowel sounds - "a" - but different consonant sounds at the beginning and end of each respective word.</s>
lerew, nephews, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "lerew" and "nephews" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In both words "a" and "o" appear as vowels, and the "w" sound is virtually identical in both words. The differences in consonant sounds lie in the first and last letters (L in "lerew" and the consonant cluster "pwn" in "nephews"). The "l" sound in "lerew" is followed by the "r" sound, which is pronounced as a rolled 'r' in English. In the term "nephews", the word "nephew" is in a compound word structure where the -"s" appended to "nephew" is indicating plurality, and "s" is used to indicate a collective noun for the plural noun "nephew". Finally, the last letter "s" in "nephews" completes a pluralizing s-sound. Thus, while they have identical vowel patterns, the consonant sound patterns are different in each word - "lerew" vs "nephews".</s>
kan, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have the following vowel sounds: "ae" in "can." Additionally, they both have the vowel sound of "o," but it is followed by a different consonant sound. "Kan" has the consonant sound "n," and "reierson" has the consonant sounds "is" and "rz." Therefore, the consonant sounds are different.</s>
sterilizations, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have the same vowel sounds (e.g., "sterilizations" and "gertner" both have the "er" sound, and "a" has the same sound in both). The only differing sounds are the consonant sounds "st" in "sterilizations" and "k" in "gertner."</s>
soady, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words soady-ken have identical vowel sounds ('o' in 'soady' and 'o' in 'ken') but different consonant sounds ('s' in 'soady' and 'k' in 'ken').</s>
terrorist, pecanins', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words are "terrorist" and "pecanins". Both words share the same vowel sounds "er" (in "terror" and "er", in "na"), "en" (in "terror" and "er", in "an"), "i" (in "ist"), "n" (in "ins"). However, the only difference between these words is the consonant sounds. "Terror" starts with a "t" (in "terror"), "p" (in "pecan"), "c" (in "can"), "a" (in "acan"), 'i' (in "in"), and 'n' (in "en"), forming the word "terror". In contrast, "pecanin" starts with a "p" (in "pecan"), "c" (in "can"), "a" (in "acan"), "i" (in "in"), "n" (in "in"), forming the word "pecanin".</s>
kuow, rudow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two words you provided, "kuow-rudow," share the same vowel sounds - specifically, the schwa vowel sound (low-e), followed by a back-rounded vowel (oo) and then another schwa. However, the two words differ in their consonant sounds. The first word, "kuow," begins with a voiced labiodental fricative ([f]). The second word, "rudow," starts with a voiced alveolo-palatal fricative ([r] and [j]). Therefore, while these words have the same vowel sounds, they differ in their consonant sounds.</s>
skibicki, devinci's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

To break it down, both "skibicki" and "devinci" have the same vowel sound combination ("ee" in this context), which is distinctive about those letters. The key difference, however, is in the consonant sounds surrounding those vowel sounds. 

"Skibicki" begins with a hard "k" and ends with a soft "ci" sound (the stress is on the final syllable). 

On the other hand, "devinci" begins with a soft "d" sound and ends with a "ci" sound (the stress is also on the final syllable). 

Although the vowel sounds are the same, the consonant sounds differ based on the placement and pronunciation of the specific letters. Thus, the words have identical vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds.</s>
sheley, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sheley" and "nyx" share the identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. Both words have "a" in their vowel sounds as the only common component among the four vowels present in each word. However, "sheley" has the consonant sound "sh" in the beginning, while "nyx" does not have any consonant sound before the vowel "a."</s>
boyes, croix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words boyes and croix have identical vowel sounds (a and oe) but different consonant sounds.</s>
saudi, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The word "saudi-premo" consists of a vowel sound (the 'a' in 'saudi') followed by two consonant sounds (the 'u' and 'i' in 'premo'). The only difference between these two words are the consonant sounds.</s>
mogopa, jocosa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "mogopa" and "jocosa," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words start with the same vowel sound ("a") and end with the same vowel sound ("sa"). The difference lies in the consonant sounds in between. "Mogopa" starts with "mo" (m) and ends with "pa" (p), while "jocosa" starts with "jo" (j) and ends with "sa" (s).</s>
huguet, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds in both words are "o", while the consonant sounds differ. In "huguet", the consonant sound is "k", while in "cona", the consonant sound is "n".</s>
schuele, heyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds, as he and ee come from different English vowel sounds. However, they do have the same number of vowels, as both words have three vowels. The differences come from the consonant sounds; "schuele" has the guttural "ch" sound, while "heyman" has the more commonly known "h" sound.</s>
zasada, navarra, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
newhard, muehlebach, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have identical vowel sounds ("oo" in "newhard" and "oo" in "muehlebach"), but they have different consonant sounds. "newhard" contains the consonant sounds "n," "w," "h," "rd," and "d," while "muehlebach" contains the consonant sounds "m," "üh," "l," and "b," "k," "a," and "f."</s>
trump, funks, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
frans, madge, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "frans" and "madge" share the same vowel sounds (frānz and mädǝ, respectively) while the consonant sounds differ. The only difference is the consonant "s" at the beginning of "frans" and the absence of a consonant before the vowel in "madge" and "h" before "a " in "frans", which are different in pronunciation but not in the vowel sounds that they produce.</s>
geitner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds are the same in "geitner" and "elcotel" in the given examples. However, the consonant sounds are different. In "geitner," the 'g' and 't' sounds are similar, while in "elcotel," the 't' sound is closer to a 'd' sound and the 'l' sound is closer to an 'r' sound.</s>
petrelli, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "petrelli" and "zele" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the word "petrelli," the vowel sounds are "ee" and "i," pronounced as /ee/ and /i/ respectively. These are the same vowel sounds as in the word "zele." On the other hand, the consonant sounds are different. The first consonant, "p," is palatalized, which means it is pronounced with a sneeze-like noise, often heard when the tongue rests on the top of the upper front teeth. The vowel sound "p" is not always the same, but it may sound different.

In "zele," the consonant sound is "s" and is pronounced as /s/ as in "set," and it's the same as in "petrelli." The palatalization is not present in "zele," so the "p" in "petrelli" is not necessary in pronunciation.

Thus, while the vowel sounds in "petrelli" and "zele" are the same, the consonant sounds are different, leading to the identification of these words as having distinct sounds.</s>
nix, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
reichley, heidi's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in "reichley" and "heidi's" are identical. The vowel sound in both words is the same, /iː/, which is the short form of the vowel sound that appears as "i" in "hit" or "bit."

However, the consonant sounds in "reichley" and "heidi's" differ. The consonant sounds in these words are /r/ in "reichley" and /h/ in "heidi's." 

So, while the vowel sounds are the same, the consonant sounds are different between the two words.</s>
colds, hoechst's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned, "colds" and "hoechst's", do share the same vowel sounds (/ɔːls/ and /oʊtst/) but the consonant sounds and the pronunciation of the remaining letters are distinct. 

The word "colds" has a "o" sound and a "l" sound, while "hoechst's" has a "ä" sound followed by a "o" sound and a "tst" (or "sh" as in "show") sound. These consonant sounds are different, making "colds" and "hoechst's" not identical in pronunciation.</s>
buzze, ruthie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "buzze-ruthie" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds, "u" and "oo," are the same in both words, but the consonant sounds are different because "b" and "r" are used in the first word and "v" and "t" are used in the second.</s>
kuehner, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "kuehner-priam" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Let me break down each word to explain this better. "Kuehner" and "Priam" both have the vowel sound 'a' (in terms of IPA notation: 'ɑ') as their first and last vowel. The 'k' in "kuehner" represents a voiceless bilabial fricative (' /k/' for the phonetic transcription) while the 'p' in "priam" represents a voiceless bilabial plosive (' /p/' for the phonetic transcription).

Hence, while the word structure, consonant and vowel sounds, differ between the two words, they still maintain the identical vowel sound within them (specifically represented by 'ɑ'). 

However, please note that to accurately analyze vowel sounds, it is often helpful to consider the pronunciation in the context of the words where they occur.</s>
biever, speakers, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The word "biever-speakers" has two distinct consonant sounds, 'b' and 'v', where the word "bespeakers" only has one consonant sound, 's'. The similarity in vowel sounds ( 'e' ) does not make up for the difference in consonant sounds. They are semantically different words as well, "biever-speakers" meaning those who speak a variety of languages, while "bespeakers" means individuals who act as intermediaries to speak for others.

Justification: Vowel sounds are the melodic aspects that humans perceive as we differentiate syllables in a word. Meanwhile, consonant sounds refer to the obstruction we perceive in speech that comes in the form of blockages in the flow of air around the vocal tract. 'B' and 'v' are two unique and distinct consonant sounds that add to the difference between these words. The word "biever-speakers" starts with two alveolar trills (an obstructed glottal consonant followed by an unobstructed voiced alveolar fricative), while "bespeakers" begins with a voiced palatal lateral approximant (a voiced lateral sound that is not obstructed). Hence, while these two words have the same vowel sound, it is only one piece of their combined consonant sounds that make them different from each other.</s>
thee, lee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the words "thee-lee," "thee" and "yee" both have the same vowel sound, [i] ̊, but the words differ in the consonantal sounds. "Thee" consists of the following consonants: "th," "e," "-," "e," "i." On the other hand, "yee" consists of the following consonants: "y," "e," "e," "i." Despite the difference in consonants, the vowel sounds remain identical in both words.</s>
encase, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Let's examine the pronunciation:

"encase" is pronounced as /en'keɪs/ - It contains ee, a vowel sound, along with other consonant sounds (c,a,s). 

"priam" is pronounced as /ˈpraɪəm/ - It has two distinct vowel sounds - a pronounced as /ˈpraɪəm/, while the remaining vowel is pronounced as /aɪ/. In addition, there are some consonant sounds at the start and end of the word.

As you can see, these words have different vowel sounds, but the consonant sounds are similar.</s>
keehan, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "keehan" and "jimmy" have identical vowel sounds (EE-EE-AN) but different consonant sounds. The first word is an alternate spelling of the given name "Kevin," while the second word is a form of the English name "James."</s>
shoplifts, roddick, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shoplifts" and "roddick" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word has an unvoiced bilabial fricative [f] and an unvoiced alveolar plosive [p] at the beginning, while the second word contains a voiced alveolar plosive [b] at the beginning.</s>
armon, bottled, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "armon-bottled" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the first word, "armon," the vowel sounds are:

A: 1+time
R: 1+time
E: 1+time
M: 1+time
O: 1+time
N: 1+time

In the second word, "bottled," the vowel sounds are:

B: 1+time
O: 1+time
T: 1+time
T: 1+time
L: 1+time
E: 1+time
D: 1+time

The only difference is in the consonant sounds, which are B, T, T, L, and D in "bottled," and M, N, N, N, and N in "armon."</s>
chlorofluorocarbons, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "chlorofluorocarbons" and "Jimmie" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In "chlorofluorocarbons", only the first letter ("c") is changed to the letter "j" in "Jimmie", while the rest of the letters maintain their original pronunciation. However, the combination of "chloro" and "fluoro" in "chlorofluorocarbons" is pronounced exactly the same as the first five letters of "Jimmie".

Both "chlorofluorocarbons" and "Jimmie" contain identical vowel sequences, but the consonant sounds in the second word are different. The main component of the differing consonant sequence is the switch from "chloro-" to "jim-", but the vowel sounds are the same for "chlorofluorocarbons" and the beginning of "Jimmie".</s>
schueler, hehman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "schueler-hehman," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Specifically, the difference lies in the combination of consonant and vowel sounds. The first word, "schueler," starts with "sch" as "soft-c" (pronounced with the tongue touching the top of the mouth, creating a "ch" sound). Then, it follows with the vowel sounds "ue" (sound in "you"), and "ler" (two syllables: "uh" and "ler").

On the other hand, the second word, "hehman," starts with "h" (pronounced as a "hushed" sound), followed by "ehm" (as in "me"), and again with "man" as two syllables: "uh" and "man."

Although the vowel sounds are the same ("ue" as "you" and "uh"), the difference in the consonant and syllable combinations yields the two words to be spelled and pronounced differently.</s>
hazing, painted, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. While both words share a common pattern with vowels (ah, oh) and consonants (z, n), they do not have identical vowel sounds. The vowel sound in "hazing" is 'ah', while in "painted," the vowel sound is 'oh'.</s>
tsuda, szalay, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the words "tsuda-szalay", the vowel sounds are the same: /i/. However, the consonant sounds are different. In the first word, there are two words, "tsuda" and "-szalay". "Tsuda" consists of the consonant /ts/ followed by the vowel /i/ (t's u a). The "-szalay" suffix has three consonant sounds: /s/, /z/, and /l/ (s z a l a y). In contrast, in "szalay", the consonant sounds are also the same: /s/, /z/, and /l/ (s z a l a y).</s>
keene, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Let me break it down for you:

- "Keene" is pronounced as /kiːni:/ where "Ke-" is "ki-" and "eene" is "iːniː"
- "Castings" is pronounced as /kæstɪŋz/ where "Cast-" is "kæst-" and the final "ings" is "ɪŋz"

The main difference lies in the vowel sounds at the beginning and the end of the words.
 
- In "Keene", the initial "Ke-" is pronounced as an "schwa" vowel /i:/ (spelled as i orɪ). 
- However, at the end of "Castings", the "e" in "ings" is pronounced somewhat more in a Germanic way, so "e" becomes more front than the "e" in "eene". It's close to the vowel spelled as "iː" in "eene".</s>
bronn, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the words "bronn-geremia", the only vowel sound that is the same is the 'a' sound in both words. However, the consonant sounds are different: 'b' vs 'r', 'n' vs 'm', 'e' vs 'i' and 'm' vs 'r'. This means the two words share only one vowel sound, so they are not homophones, but they share three out of four consonant sounds, so they are related words with different meanings.</s>
traxler, gafford, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
nepal, reforms, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds ("ee" sound) but different consonant sounds. The first two letters of "nepal" and "reforms" are "n" and "r", while the first two letters of "nepal-reforms" are "f" and "r". Therefore, the consonant sounds are different.</s>
outage, brownish, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "outage-brownish" share identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds between them. 

Explanation: 
- The first word, "outage," consists of the consonant clusters "out" and "age." It has the vowels 'a' and 'e' and no diphthong (a group of vowels joined together).
- The second word, "brownish," consists of the consonant clusters "brow" and "nish." The group of vowels 'e' and 'i' used together in this word is called a diphthong.
 
Thus, while both words have the same vowel sounds, their consonant sounds are different due to the presence of the diphthong in "brownish."</s>
schaal, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the words "schaal" and "hymen," the vowel sounds are the same: "a." However, the difference comes from the consonant sounds. In "schaal," the "c" is a "soft c," producing a "s" sound, while in "hymen," the "y" is pronounced as a "y" sound and becomes the sound of the "i" in "hymen." Despite the different consonant sounds, the overall pronunciation of the vowel remains the same.</s>
acid, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
ratify, apolline, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "ratify" and "apolline," have identical vowel sounds. They both consist of a single vowel sound, /ɑ/, followed by another vowel sound /ˈaʊ/, and a completely different consonant sound in each word.</s>

novoa, motola, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "novoa-motola" have identical vowel sounds, /o/ and /a/ in both words, but different consonant sounds. In "novoa," the first "o" is pronounced as [o:] while the first and final "o" (voiced) in "motola" is pronounced as [o].</s>
switalski, hirai, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No. These words have the same vowel sounds (aɪ) in both, but different consonant sounds. In "switalski," the stress is on the first syllable, and the consonant sound in "lski" sounds more like "ls". In "hirai," the stress is on the second syllable, and the consonant sound in "rai" sounds more like "ry". It is like two different words, one ending with "lski" and the other "rai", where both syllables are pronounced but the "l" in "lski" sounds like "ls" and "ry" sounds like "ry" in the other word.</s>
dairy, neni's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dairy" and "neni's" have identical vowel sounds ("a" in both cases) but different consonant sounds. In "dairy," the consonant sounds are 'd' and 'r'; whereas, in "neni's," they are 'n' and no consonant sound.</s>
zaley, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zaley" and "gemma" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In these two words, the vowel sounds remain the same - /ɛ/, but the consonant sounds vary. "Zaley" starts with a ズ (z) and end with an ɪ (i) sound, while "gemma" starts with a ð (ð) and ends with an ə (a) sound. Despite these changes in the consonant sounds, the vowel sounds remain the same, making them similar but not identical in pronunciation.</s>
chaussee, paoli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word pair "chaussee-paoli" has identical vowel sounds (/ʃoˈzei/, /pɑɔli/) but different consonant sounds. In the first word, the "e" in "chaussee" has a closed sound, while in the second word, the "e" has a slightly open sound.</s>
stowell, mrazek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "stowell" and "mrazek" have identical vowel sounds, but have different consonant sounds. In the first word, the emphasis is mainly on the vowel sounds while in the second word it is on consonants. However, in the context of vowel sounds they are the same.</s>

jacobites, apolline, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words 'jacobites' and 'apolline' have identical vowel sounds (/əˈpɒlən/ and /dʒəˈkəbuːtiz/). However, they do have different consonant sounds, with 'jacobites' having /z/ at the end and 'apolline' having /l/ at the end.</s>
shewmake, prunedale, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the words "shewmake" and "prunedale," the only differences are the consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in both words (e in "shewmake" and "prunedale") are the same. Therefore, they are identically pronounced except for the consonant sounds at the beginning of each word, which differ.</s>
zeva, jameson, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zeva-jameson" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The pronunciation of "zeva" is the same as "jameson," but "ja" and "ze" are two different consonants, resulting in different consonant sounds.</s>
zele, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
mogopa, jojoba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned, "mogopa" and "jojoba," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

To break it down, "mogopa" has two consonant sounds - "m" and "p," while "jojoba" has two different consonant sounds - "j" and "b." The vowel sounds, however, are the same, "o," while the consonant sounds differ. This is known as the "phono-semantic principle," where the pronunciation of words is still connected to their meaning, even when the sounds of the words might seem to differ.</s>
zeal, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zeal" and "sumerlin" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In both words, the sound before the vowels is the same, which consists of [z] before "ee" in "zeal" and "oo" in "sumerlin." The vowels themselves, "ee" in "zeal" and "um" (with an unstressed "oo") in "sumerlin," are identical. However, the consonant sounds that follow the vowels are different, with "l" in "zeal" and "r" in "sumerlin."</s>

wipperfurth, tinkerer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "wipperfurth" and "tinkerer" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In "wipperfurth," the word starts with "w" and follows with two "i" vowels. In "tinkerer," it begins with "t" and has one "i" vowel. While the "e" in "wipperfurth" and "tinkerer" have different pronunciations, the number and arrangement of vowels and consonants are the same, resulting in the same vowel sounds.</s>
niehoff, seymour's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "niehoff" and "seymour's" have the same number of vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds. There is only one vowel sound ("o") present in both words.</s>
shill, gemmer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "shill-gemmer," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In this phrase, there are two words: "shill," "gemmer." Both words share the same initial vowels, "sh," but have different consonant sounds, "l" in the first word and "m" in the second. Thus, their vowel sounds are the same, but their consonant sounds differ.</s>
elisa, fajita, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
saudi, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The two words are:

1. "saudi-koehne"
2. "see-yuh-ko-eyn"

In the first word "saudi-koehne", the vowels are combined and it sounds like "see-you-ko-eyn". But, when "s" and "y" are pronounced separately, it would sound like "see-yuh-ko-eyn". They are similar but not identical in pronunciation.</s>
kozar, lowder, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the words "kozar" and "lowder," the vowel sounds remain the same but the consonant sounds are different. The letters "k" and "l" change the consonant sounds in both words.</s>
swasey, conti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "swasey" and "conti," share the same number of vowels (4) and have the same number of consonants (5). The only difference in the two words are the consonant sounds.

'Swasey' starts with the same vowel sound ('a'), followed by three 's' and an 'e' (same vowel).
The 'C' in 'conti' does not make a similar sound to the 'C' in 'swasey', but it is an entirely separate word, hence I would classify it as 'yes' since the only difference between the two words is in the 'C' sound and the unique word itself 'conti'. They do not sound precisely the same like 'boy' and 'goy' that are considered homophones, but they are not that different to be considered words within the same cluster like 'cat' and 'got'. They are close enough to be considered phonetically alike.</s>
leiker, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
schuele, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuele" and "zelia" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both have an "s" sound, a "u" sound and then end with a "e" sound. However, "schuele" has a "tch" sound at the beginning, and "zelia" has a "j" sound at the beginning.</s>
saudi, hermon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds (u-i) but different consonant sounds. The words are "saudi-hermon," where "s" is the only vowel sound while "h" and "m" are the only consonant sounds.</s>
rhythmic, winslett, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only minor distinction lies in the consonant sounds, with "th" in the first word and "s" in the second. Despite this difference, the overall structure of the words remains the same — i.e., two syllables, one single vowel sound each, and shared consonant sounds in the beginning.</s>
easel, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "easel" and "bruner" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference between the words is the consonant sounds at the beginning, with "easel" starting with the letter "e" and "bruner" starting with the letter "b".</s>
cv, preteens, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sowder, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two words that you provided, "sowder" and "baran", do indeed have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words contain the vowel sound "a," which is at the beginning of each word, followed by the vowel sound "i" in the second syllable. However, the consonant sounds that follow the vowel sounds differ. In "sowder," the sound "o" and "u" produce the consonant sounds "w" and "d" respectively. In "baran," the sound "a" and "n" produce the consonant sounds "b" and "r" respectively. While the two words differ in their specific consonant sounds, they do share the same essential consonant patterns, thereby proving that they have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
keeny, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
lockers, girten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "lockers" and "girten," do have the same vowel sounds (/lɒkərz/ and /ɡɪˈtɛn/) but different consonant sounds. In the word "lockers", the 'r' is pronounced at the end while in "girten", the 'r' is preceded by a /t/. Other than these differences, the vowels in both words are identical.</s>
dugas, sewall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "dugas" and "sewall," have identical vowel sounds (/a/) but different consonant sounds. In English, vowel sounds and consonant sounds are distinct; one cannot have an identical vowel sound without the same consonant sounds as well. The two words you provided, however, have different consonant sounds (d and s) but the same vowel sound (/a/), which means the words are not the same, they just have the same vowel sound.</s>
gummi, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, this statement claims that the words "gummi-keene" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the words "gummi" and "keene," the vowels (specifically the short-schwa vowel) are phonetically identical. The schwa vowel is the shortest and most common vowel sound in English. This vowel sound is represented in both words by the character "a."

However, in the words "gummi" and "keene," the consonant sounds are different. In "gummi," the first consonant "g" has a "hard" sound or a stop consonant. In "keene," the first consonant "k" sounds like a "soft" or fricative consonant.

So, while the vowel sounds are identical, the consonant sounds in "gummi" and "keene" are different, which makes these two words distinctly different in their pronunciation.</s>
boughan, dowda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "boughan-dowda" have the same vowel sound but different consonant sounds.
The justification for this answer is as follows:

1. Identify the vowels in both words:
- In the first word "boughan", there are two vowels: "o" and "a".
- In the second word "dowda", there are also two vowels: "o" and "a".
2. Compare the vowel sounds in both words:
Both words "boughan" and "dowda" have the same vowel sound, which is "o-a".
3. Identify the consonants in both words:
- In the first word "boughan", there are three consonants: "b", "o", and "n".
- In the second word "dowda", there are also three consonants: "d", "o", and "a".
4. Compare the consonant sounds in both words:
The consonant sounds are different in both words. The first word has "b" and "o", while the second word has "d" and "o". The difference between "b" and "d" and "n" and "a" changes the overall sound of each word.

In conclusion, the two words "boughan-dowda" have the same vowel sound but different consonant sounds.</s>
threadbare, telexed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words have the vowel sound "e," followed by the consonant sounds represented by "r," "x," and "d." However, "threadbare" has consonant sounds represented by "th," "r," "d," and "b," while "telexed" has consonant sounds represented by "t," "l," "x," and "d." 

Explanation: Both words have the same vowel sound "e" spelled "e." The only difference between them is the consonant sounds, which can be heard when the words are pronounced.</s>
nowa, douthat, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two words "nowadouthat" and "nowadouthat" do not have identical vowel sounds. The first word has the vowel "o", while the second word has the vowel "a". The rest of the letters are the same, but changing the vowel changes the overall sound of the word.</s>
oslo, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
chalet, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "chalet" and "smullen," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference is that the word "smullen" has an additional "s" sound after the "m" sound, while "chalet" does not have that added sound.</s>
saudi, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "saudi" and "electoral" have identical vowel sounds (/ɔːdi/). However, the consonant sounds differ: 

1. "Saudi" has the consonant sound /s/.
2. "Electoral" has the consonant sound /ɛ/.

Since both words have the same vowel sound (/ɔːdi/) but different consonant sounds, they are not exactly the same, and therefore the answer is No.</s>
berated, effacing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words, "berated" and "effacing," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference between them lies in the consonant sounds at the beginning and end of the words. "Berated" begins with the sound "/b/", while "effacing" begins with the sound "/ɛ/". The final consonant in "berated" is "/d/", while in "effacing" it is "/s/". In this sense, they follow a pattern where the beginning and end consonants are different but the vowel sounds are identical.</s>
houses, douthat, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "houses" and "douthat" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds, as the letters 's' and 't' are the only distinctions between the two words.</s>
houses, bauman, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word 'houses', the vowel sounds are the same: 'o' in 'houses' and 'oo' in 'houses'. 

In the word 'baumann', the vowel sounds are different: 'oo' in 'houses' and 'a' in 'baumann'. Therefore, the vowel sounds are not identical. Additionally, the consonant sounds between the words are different as well: 's' in 'houses' and 'b' in 'baumann'. The first letter 'h' also makes differences in stress. So, overall, these two words do not share the identical vowel sounds or identical consonant sounds.</s>
calvano, armato, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "calvano" and "armato," share the same vowel sounds (AE and OE) but have different consonant sounds (CH and RM). This meets the criteria for words having identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
litigating, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words have "a" as the first vowel sound; however, the consonant sounds before the vowel differ. The first word, "litigating," has "l" before the vowel, where the second word, "conn," has "n" before the same vowel. Despite these differences, the vowel sound remains the same in both words.</s>
gumm, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Although the words "gumm-knacks" may seem like they should sound different due to the placement of the "-m" and "-k" consonants, it is important to consider their phonetic contexts. In this case, both words have identical vowel sounds and the consonants are slightly shifted. Taking the context into account, the pronunciation is almost identical, making them homophones. Homophones are words that sound like each other but have different meanings, often depending on the context in which they are used.</s>
sighed, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sighed-hannam" have the same pattern of vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Vowels are pronounced as "ee-gee-ee-ah" and "ee-gee-ee-ann-ah", while consonants are pronounced differently ("sighed", "hannam"). They have the same sound but different components, which is why they have the same label in terms of vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds.</s>
biever, siemers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "biever" and "siemers" have identical vowel sounds (both contain the vowel 'i') but different consonant sounds (one contains 'v' and the other contains 's').</s>
shelley, goyim, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
keehan, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The reason is because the vowel sounds in "keehan" and "jammer" are distinct. In "keehan," the first two vowels, /i:/ and /i/, have different vowel sounds. Similarly, the vowel sound in "jammer" (/a/) is different from the vowel sound in "keehan" (/u/: "keehan"). Additionally, the consonant sounds in each word are unique. "Keehan" starts with a consonant (k) while "jammer" starts with a vowel (/j/ in "jammer"). Furthermore, "jammer" also contains the consonant /m/ while "keehan" does not. The differences in vowel and consonant sounds in each word make them distinct from each other.</s>
parkman, bottled, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "parkman" and "bottled" have identical vowel sounds, but they differ in consonant sounds, specifically "b" in "bottled" and "k" in "parkman". This is because the letters "k" and "b" occupy the same position within their respective words, and the same applies to the letters "r" and "p", "t" and "k", "d" and "l". Thus, despite their different consonant sounds, the vowel sounds remain identical.</s>
seder, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "seder" and "kissling" have identical vowel sounds (a or i at the start and e or o for the other vowels) but different consonant sounds, which gives them different pronunciations. In the word "seder," the first 's' is pronounced /s/ while the first 'k' is /k/. In "kissling," the first 'k' is /k/ too, but the 's' is pronounced /ʃ/ (like the shh sound) instead of the 's' in "seder." So, these two words share the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds, making them distinct from each other.</s>
sewed, shelor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words you provided, "sewed" and "shelor," share identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. Both are spelled similarly, with only the addition of a consonant in the second word: a hard "s" vs. a soft "sh" and a "w" vs. a "l". Thus, the vowel pattern (e-o-u) remains the same, but the consonants give them different sounds.</s>
emory's, cheverly, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words have different vowel sounds and consonant sounds. 

Emory's (em-uh-reez) has a diphthong "ah" sound in the "em". Cheverly (chuhv-uh-ree-lee) pronounces the consonant "v" with a "B" sound and "r" with a "w" sound.</s>
breastfed, negev, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The word "breastfed" has the following vowel sounds: 'b', 'ee', 'r', 'st', 'f', 'd'. The word "negev" also has the following vowel sounds: 'n', 'y', 'y', 'y', 'f'.

Although they both use the 'e' vowel sound in the middle of the words, "breastfed" has 'b' and 'st' sounds in the consonant part, while "negev" has 'n' and 'f' sounds.</s>
degrace, switalski, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds. "Degrace" and "Switalski" are different English words, but they share the same sequence of vowels ("AH-eye-AH-le-eye-eye-ee-AH" for "degrac" and "swital" in "Switalski") with identical vowel sounds. Their consonant sounds, however, are distinct. 

"Degrace" has no consonants while "Switalski" has numerous different consonant sounds, "Sw" for "swital", "ti" for "ital", and an "ll" for the "l" in "lista," among others. These are all different consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds remain consistent.</s>
whippany, trilogy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the word "whippany", the vowel sound is [ɪ] and in the word "trilogy", the vowel sound is also [ɪ]. The only change in the consonant sounds is in the beginning of each word. In "whippany", the "h" sound is an [h] sound, while in "trilogy", it is an [ħ] sound. Other than that, the vowel sounds are identical.</s>
calais, hurray, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "calais" and "hurray," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words start with the vowel sound "a," and have the same vowel sound throughout. However, the consonant sounds in each word are different. "Calais" has the consonant sound "l," while "hurray" has the consonant sound "r." Despite these differences in consonant sounds, both words fit the criteria for having identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
dejoseph, atonement, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dejoseph" and "atonement" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The main reason for this is that both words have a common root: The "ea" vowel in "dejoseph" resembles the "io" vowel in "atonement," and both words share a "j" and "e" in their respective endings. The only difference between the two is the consonant sounds "de" in the first word and "at" in the second, which makes them distinctly different.</s>
franco's, saslow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words you provided, "franco's-saslow," are true to their word form with five vowels and each vowel has no identical sounds because they have unique sounds; for example, the "a" sound in "franco" and the "a" sound in "saslow" are dissimilar. The only common feature is the presence of the letter "a." In "franco," the vowel 'A' is long, and in "saslow" is also long while being identical. In a broader spectrum, the consonant sounds are not really similar, with only the presence of the letter "s" as a common feature. Each consonant in "franco" has significantly distinct sounds compared to the consonants in "saslow."</s>
doughtie, glory, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "doughtie-glory" indeed have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. This means that the vowel sounds can be homophones, which are words that sound the same but have different meanings. In this case, /ɔː/, /ɔː/, and /oʊ/ appear in the first word and have the same vowel sound /ɔː/ as in the second word "glory." However, the consonants differ.</s>
hermann, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hermann" and "zeal" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In both words, the vowel sound is "a" (as in the word "father") followed by two more "a" sounds. The first "a" creates a long vowel sound, while the other two "a" sounds create a series of short vowel sounds.

The consonant sounds, however, are different: "hermann" has the consonant "h" (as in the word "hot"), while "zeal" has the consonant "z" (as in the word "zeal"). So these two words are similar in vowel sounds but different in consonant sounds.</s>
vienna's, gilberta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words vienna's-gilberta have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. This is because if you pay close attention, you will notice that both words have the vowel sound of "i" (say "eee" or "ee"). However, the consonant sounds between these vowels differ in each word. In "vienna's," the "v" comes before the "i" while in "gilberta," the "g" comes before the "i". 

In further detail, these differences can be described as follows:

In "vienna's":
- The first vowel sound (before the "i") is a "shhh, like the sound of a whisper."
- The "v" is a hard "v" sound, like the "v" in "vault."
- The second vowel sound (before the "i") is a "long, drawn out" "eee" sound, or a quick "ay" sound.
- The "e" is a "quick little schwa sound, like you would make if you are trying to not fully enunciate."
- The "i" ("ee") is a smooth, drawn out sound.

In "gilberta":
- The first vowel sound (before the "i") is also a "shhh, like the sound of a whisper."
- The "g" sound ("g" or "j") can be either a consonant with a "g" shape for the lips or a "
gettin', encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || These words do have identical vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds. The words are GETTIN' - ENCASE. The similarities between the first word and the second word are mainly due to the fact that the first word starts with a 'G' pronounced like an 'N', and the second word starts with an 'N' that's actually a 'C' in disguise. So, the main difference between them is not vowel sounds but consonant sounds.</s>
you're, tooke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "you're-tooke" contain identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds.

In the given words, both begin with the vowel sound /y/. However, the second vowel, /re/, is pronounced with a different sound in each word. In "you're-tooke", the third letter "re" is pronounced as the schwa sound /ə/ (not as in "merry"). In the word "tooke", the same "re" is pronounced as the long back vowel /ɜ:/ (not as in "tree"). While the vowels have different sounds, the core sound of /y/ and the following vowel both remain the same.

Therefore, the two words still have the same vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds due to the differences in the pronunciation of the letters "r" and "e".</s>
basks, madge, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "basks" and "madge" both have the same vowel sounds /æ/ (in "bask" and "ask") and /i/ (in "bask" and "edge") but different consonant sounds. The former consists of /s/, /k/, /s/, however, while the latter consists of /d/, /æ/, and /d/. Despite this difference, they have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
schuler, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'schuler' and 'gotten' have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Here's why: 'SCHULER' is pronounced as /ˈʃuːlɛr/, and 'GOTTEN' is pronounced as /ɡəˈtɛn/. Both have the same vowel sound, /ʌ/, followed by two different consonants: /h/ in 'SCHULER' and /t/ in 'GOTTEN'.</s>
matthias, delilah, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "matthias" and "delilah" have identical vowel sounds, but they differ in the consonant sounds. In the word "matthias," the letter "t" and the letter "h" are the consonant sounds, while in the word "delilah," the letter "l" is the consonant sound between the two vowels.</s>
cuellar, ruter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words 'cuellar' and 'ruter' do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
cheever, speakers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cheever" and "speakers" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. All the vowels in both words are the same (e, ew, i, ,, ,), but there are significant differences in the consonant sounds. The only consonant that remains the same through both words is the "s". The consonant sounds in "cheever" are ch, e, w, er, while in "speakers" the consonant sounds are s, p, l, e, a, k, and rs.</s>
jocular, wattenberg, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes,</s>
wetsuit, jeju, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. "Wetsuit" consists of three vowels (/ɛ, s, ʌ/ and /z, u, t/) whereas "Jeju" has only two vowels, (/s, e/ and /ʒ, u,/), but all the vowel sounds are the same. Even though the consonant sounds are different between the two words, the vowel sounds are identical.</s>
lids, steere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both "lids" and "steere" share the vowel sound /i:/ in the middle syllable (ids, dere), but have different consonant sounds at the beginning and end of each word. The word "lids" starts with a /l/ sound, while the word "steere" starts with a /s/ sound. Additionally, "lids" ends with a /j/ sound, while "steere" ends with a /r/ sound.</s>
pyro, heico's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds, but they have different consonant sounds. 

Here are the words broken down into their individual elements for comparison:

1. pyro-heico's (American English)
* p (hard p) + y + r + o + he + ic + o's (soft 'o' in the words I and a 'h' at the end)

2. para-hydroacetic acid (American English)
* p (soft p) + a + r + a + hy + dro + ac + etic + acid

As you can see, both sets of words consist of the same vowel sounds (yro + hy) with different consonant sounds at the beginning and end of each syllable, with the exception of "ic" in 'pyro-heico's' and "hy" in 'para-hydroacetic acid'.</s>
cannery, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds are identical in "cannery" and "smullen", but the consonant sounds are different between the words.</s>
sader, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sader" and "litigating" do have the same vowel sounds, but they have different consonant sounds. The primary difference is in the consonants that precede the vowels.

1. 's': Both words start with the letter 's', but in the first word "sader" it is a voiceless alveolar s sound, while in the second word "litigating" it is a voiceless postalveolar s sound.
2. 'l': Both words contain the 'l' sound. The second word, "litigating," has this 'l' at the end, giving it the pronunciation of /ɪˈtaɪlɪˈgetɪŋ/. In contrast, "sader" has this 'l' positioned in the middle of the word, but still sounds the same. This gives the word /saɪˌdɚ/.
3. 'i': Both words share the 'i' sound. The only difference here is that "sader" spells it as "i", while "litigating" spells it differently. Nevertheless, the pronunciation remains the same in both words.

Therefore, the key vowel sounds stay the same in both words, although the consonant sounds differ.</s>
eichen, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "eichen" and "germer," have identical vowel sounds (ee, ee) but different consonant sounds, specifically, the difference lies in the first letter, consonant (c vs g). One changes from a guttural 'ch' to a voiceless 'g' sound.</s>
aiming, painted, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
koehne, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words you mentioned, "koehne-jam", have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
oshell, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds (oi) but different consonant sounds (sh and z). I will break down both words as an example:

1. oshell - The "o" in this word is a diphthong 'oi' (long 'e' sound), the 'sh' is a plain 'sh' sound, and the -l in the end is silent.

2. zell - There are two sounds: the 'z' is a voiced postalveolar sibilant 'z' sound, and the -l in the end is a voiceless labiodental fricative (-<v) + a /l/ sound.

Thus, despite the different consonant sounds, the vowel sounds remain identical in both words.</s>
zeva, lakeman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zeva" and "lakeman" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words share the same vowel sounds (e in the first word, i in the second) but have completely different consonant clusters (z in the first word, l-k-m in the second).</s>
capehart, deja, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in the words "capehart" and "deja" are the same, but the consonant sounds are different. 

In "capehart," the "c" and "k" are close, the "e" and "i" are far, and the "t" and "d" are far. This results in close I-V-X sound.

In "deja," the "d" and "j" are close, the "e" and "i" are far, and the "a" and "a" are close, but the "a" starts and ends on different vowels. This results in close E-I-A phoneme segmentation.

Therefore, the vowel sounds are the same, but the consonant sounds are different, leading to a different sequence of phonetic segments.</s>
haggart, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
jemmie, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "jemmie" and "castings," have the same vowel sounds, AY, and the same consonant sounds at the beginning, K, but they are spelled differently with different words connected between the vowel and the consonant. This difference in spelling affects the pronunciation of the words, resulting in different pronunciations overall.</s>

breon, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "breon" and "gemme," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. However, in a linguistic sense, these words have different meanings and are separate words in the English language.</s>
sowed, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "sowed" and "Priam" do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds.

Explanation:
In the word "sowed," the vowel sounds are /aʊd/ and /əʊd/, while in "Priam," the vowel sound is /p r i ə m/. Although both words have "o" in the same positions (the "o" in "sowed" and the "r" in "Priam"), the surrounding vowels and consonants create noticeable differences in sound between the two words.</s>
dembski, ghezzi, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. However, both words do share the same set of vowels. The only difference between them is the consonant sounds. 

'Dembski-Ghezzi' has the initial consonant pronounced as "dem" (like "dime") and the final consonant pronounced as "dz" (like "diz"). On the other hand, 'Dembski-Ghezzi' has the initial consonant pronounced as "dime" (like "dime") and the final consonant pronounced as "zz" (like "azz").</s>

In conclusion, while the vowel sounds are the same, the consonant sounds are different between these two words.</s>
shirlee, gama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Specifically, both words share the vowel sounds of 'ee' and 'a' ('e' and 'i' separately are identical as well, but as written above, I've separated the individual vowels). The difference lies in the consonant sounds - the first word has 'sh' (which is silent in the given context) while the second word has 'g'.</s>
dow's, shouts, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Reasoning:
- The first word, "dow's-shouts," only has one occurrence of the word "dow" where the consonant sound is present, while there are multiple instances of the consonants in the word "shouts".
- The second word, "dow's-shouts", has the two separate words "dow" and "shouts". The first word consists of two separate sounds, but in the second word the words are not divided; therefore, they do not have identical vowel sounds.</s>
seader, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seader" and "gaetano" have identical vowel sounds (/e:d/, /a:t/o:n/o/) but different consonant sounds (/s/, /ʃ/, /d/, /g/, /ɛ/, /ɛ/, /t/, /o/, /o/, /o/, /n/).</s>
rosie's, towey, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In "rosie's-towey", there are two differences in the sounds associated with their vowels:

In the words "moe-hoechst's," there are two different vowels: "o" and "a," where the vowel in the word with hyphen (-) "moe" has a different pronunciation compared to the word "hoechst's."

To provide a clearer example, the vowel "o" in "moe" is pronounced with a rounded lip and high-pitched tone, resembling the "o" in "not." On the other hand, the vowel "o" in "hoechst's" has a flat or unrounded lip and medium-pitched tone, as in the word "pool." The 't' in "st's" is silent.</s>
hermann, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "hermann" and "necaise," have the same initial and final vowels (A) but have different middle vowel sounds and consonant sounds.

In "giacco," the consonant sound is a "k" pronounced as in "kneckle."</s>
sonoda, motola, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "sonoda-motola" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. This is because the first word, "sonoda," has four vowel sounds: 's', 'o', 'n', and 'a', while the second word, "motola," has six vowel sounds: 'm', 'o', 't', 'o', 'l', and 'a'. The only difference between the two words is the consonant sounds, with the addition of 't' in 'motola'.</s>
nyx, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. The words "nyx" and "jammer" do share some similarities, such as a /j/ pronunciation, but "nyx" has an open 'e' sound at the end, while "jammer" has a different pronunciation with a closed 'e' sound at the end. Therefore, they have different vowel sounds.</s>
elmhurst, theberge, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "elmhurst" and "theberge", have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the word "elmhurst", the vowel sounds can be identified as "a" (in "earl"), "e" (in "nest"), "i" (in "dirt"), "h" (in "urch"), "u" (in "hurst"), and "r" (in "rest").

shiller, game, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. These two words, "shiller" and "game", do have the same vowel (EE/AE) sounds. The rest of the sounds in the two words are different, in "shiller" it is /ʃ/ and /ɪər/ while in "game", it is /ɡ/ and /eɪm/. Therefore the consonants sounds are different.</s>
lloyds', croix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words lloyds' - croix have the same vowel sounds: "l" and "o" but with different consonant sounds: "s'" in lloyds' and "x" in croix. 

Justification:
In lloyds', the "l" and "o" have the same vowel sound, while the "s'" is a glottal stop with reduced vowel sound, which is a type of consonant. In croix, the "x" is a voiceless labiodental fricative, which is a different consonant sound than the "s'" in lloyds'.</s>
hyman, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hyman" and "osler" have the same combination of vowel sounds (i, ei) but have different consonant sounds. In the word "hyman," the first "h" is pronounced as in "happy," while in "osler," the first "o" is unvoiced, more similar to the sound of "o" in "often."</s>
connor, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
ken, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ken-jamb" have identical vowel sounds ('a' and 'e'), but have different consonant sounds. The first word, "ken-jamb," contains the vowels 'a' and 'e', and the syllables 'ken' and 'jamb' are pronounced similarly, but with different consonant sounds. One way to distinguish between the two words is to focus on the 'k' sound in the first word and the 'j' sound in the second word.</s>
kohn, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kohn" and "bahraini" have the same vowel sound (o) but different consonant sounds. However, the similarity between these words is based on their individual meanings, not the sounds of their vowels.</s>
mahmood, hanshew, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds and identical consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds in "mahmood" and "hanshew" are different. You can hear it at 0.39 and 1.28 seconds respectively: 

1. In "mahmood" the vowel sound is at the beginning around 0.39.
2. In "hanshew" the vowel sound starts at around 1.28.

In other words, the vowel sounds are not the same. The consonant sounds are also different, one has the "-m-" sound and the other the "-h-" sound which differ in pronunciation as well. 

Another way to answer this is via the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) which is a phonetic alphabet that provides a standardized representation of speech sounds used in many languages. The IPA for "mahmood" vowel sound at 0.39 is /ɑ/ and at 1.28 is /ʌ/ whereas for "hanshew" the IPA for vowel sound at 1.28 is /ɒ/</s>
enex, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds. The words are "enex" and "braner." Both words begin with the same vowel sound (a close-mid front unrounded vowel) and end with the same vowel sound (a close-mid back unrounded vowel). However, the second word, "braner," has a consonant sound (/b/) in the middle, while the first word, "enex," has no consonant sound.</s>
gumm, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words "gumm-lookers" contain the same consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The only two vowels present in both words are the schwa sounds [ə]. The first word starts with "k" followed by two consonant clusters "gm" and "lk". The second word starts with "k" followed by the same two consonant clusters "gm" and "lk". Therefore, the consonant sounds are the same for both words, but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
side, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
chalet, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned, "chalet" and "chlorofluorocarbons" share identical vowel sounds, which means they are homophones.

The justification for this is as follows: "Chalet" has three consonants at the beginning of the word (cha-let), while "chlorofluorocarbons" has four consonants at the beginning of the word (chlor-ofluoro-carbons). The only difference between the two words is the placement of the consonant clusters. Despite this, the vowel sounds in both words remain identical: one or more long 'o' sounds in the middle of the words.</s>
karoun, pursued, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The words "karoun" and "pursued" have the following features:

1. Vowel Sounds: Both words have identical vowel sounds. In "karoun," the vowel sound is /a:/, and in "pursued," it is also /a:/. These two vowels are the same, and they are the major factor that contributes to their identical vowel sounds.

2. Consonant Sounds: Although these words have different consonant sounds, this difference does not affect their vowel sounds. In "karoun," the word starts with the sound /k/{k as in "cat"}, whereas the word "pursued" starts with the sound /p/{pronounced as in "put"}. The difference in the first consonant does not change the vowel sounds.

3. Other Factors: Considering that the vowel sounds are the same, further differences in pronunciation and consonant distribution should be noted. For instance, "karoun" is a common Kurdish name, whereas "pursued" is derived from the verb "to pursue." These contextual differences might affect how the words are pronounced in different situations, but they do not change the fact that the vowel sounds are the same in both words.

In conclusion, while the two words "karoun" and "pursued" have different consonant sounds, their distinct vowel sounds remain the same. This means that each word still carries a different
necaise, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words necaise and koehn do have identical vowel sounds (each with a single short ɛ) but have different consonant sounds. The difference lies in the consonant sounds preceding the vowel, with "ne" in necaise and "k" in koehn.</s>
behoff, leon, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "behoff-leon" have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Breaking down the words, "behoff" and "leon" both have two vowels: /ɛ/ and /o/ in "ease" and "ho", respectively. The consonants in these words differ: "b" in "behoff" and "l" in "leon." The vowel sounds remain the same, which leads to the classification of having the same letter sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
posterize, override, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'posterize' and 'override' have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

zele, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned, "zele" and "jammer," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Despite the changes in consonant sounds, both words contain the same vowels: "ae" (as in "meat"). The difference lies in the consonants "z" in "zele" and "j" in "jammer," which are distinct sounds.</s>
berated, misplaces, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the words "berated" and "misplaces," the vowel sounds are the same (i.e., the short "a" sound in "berated" and the long "a" sound in "misplaces"). However, the letters between the vowels are different (the consonants "b" in "berated," "m" in "misplaces," and the space in "misplaces"). Despite these differences in consonant sounds, the overall vowel sound is identical in both words.</s>
musings, subic, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "musings" and "subic" have the same vowel sound pattern - "e" and "a." However, the consonant sounds are different: "s" and "z."</s>
naina, ribald, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words start with the vowel "a" followed by a consonant "n", however, the consonant and other vocal sounds in the middle and at the end of these words are different. 

naina:
- a vowel sound (a)
- a consonant sound (n)
- a consonant sound (i)
- a vowel sound (n)
- a vowel sound (a)

ribald:
- a vowel sound (a)
- a consonant sound (r)
- a consonant sound (i)
- a vowel sound (b)
- a vowel sound (a)
- a consonant sound (l)
- a consonant sound (d)

So, while the vowel sounds are the only thing that remains the same, there are different consonant sounds that dissect these words and make them different.</s>
multiprocessor, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words, "multiprocessor" and "necaise", have the exact same number and vowel sounds. However, the consonants in "necaise" are different from the consonants in "multiprocessor".

excelling, aachener, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in both words are identical ("a"). However, the consonant sounds are different: "ex" is in "excelling," while "x" is in "Aachener." Despite this difference, both words have the same vowel sounds.</s>
behoff, seema, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "behoffseema" and "behoffseema" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. This is because the consonant sounds at the beginning of each word are different: "be" vs. "be". The rest of the vowels and consonants are the same. Although the words are identical except for the consonants at the beginning, they are still considered similar words due to their overall phonetic structure, which includes the presence of the same vowel sounds.</s>
guertin, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "guertin" and "jamb" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. "Guertin" is the name of a place in New Hampshire, while "jamb" is a part of a door, window, or other opening that provides support. 

Justification: 

To determine if the words have identical vowel sounds, compare the vowels of each word. In "guertin," the vowels are "eu" while in "jamb," they are "im." The only difference is the second consonant, which changes the vowel sounds. However, the vowel "eu" and "im" are the same, so the words still have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
guertin, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "Guertin" and "Jaimie," have identical vowel sounds (ee sound in "ee" spelled with an "i") but different consonant sounds (g sound in "Guertin" and j sound in "Jaimie").</s>
sighed, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "sighed" and "excelling," have identical vowel sounds (/iː/) within their syllables. However, they differ in the consonant sounds. "Sighed" has a hard "G" sound in the final consonant, while "excelling" has a soft "L" sound /lɪŋ/.</s>
shelley, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "shelley-kanne," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In this case, the only difference lies in the consonant sounds between 's' and 'k' and 'n' sounds. The word 'shelley' contains a 's' followed by 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', and 'e' while 'kanne' contains a 'k' followed by 'a', 'n', 'n', and 'e'. Despite the difference in these consonant sounds, the vowel sounds remain identical - the 'aeiou' vowel sounds.</s>
ikon, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ikon-boren" have identical vowel sounds, but differ in consonant sounds. The consonant sounds in the second word "boren" are represented by the letters "b", "o", and "r". These letters can be rearranged in the word "ikon" to create "ikon-boren", which has the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
herded, curlin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "herded" and "curlin" have identical vowel sounds ("er, ed") but different consonant sounds. They are simply different words with the same vowel patterns.</s>
o'kane, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word, "o'kane," has the vowel sounds "o" and "a" (repeatedly). The second word, "jemmie," also has the vowel sounds "o" and "a." However, the consonant sounds are different – 'k' in the first word and 'jm' in the second word. The 'k' in "o'kane" could be pronounced as a "g" or a "k" sound (it's an Irish name, pronounced "o-guh-nay"). Nevertheless, it does not change the similarity of the vowel sounds.</s>
vim, spic, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vim-spic" have identical vowel sounds (the first "i" in both words) but they differ in the consonant sounds. Let me break it down: 

1. Vim: The word "vim" has two distinct consonant sounds: "v" and "m".
2. Spic: The word "spic" comprises of three consonant sounds: "s", "p", and "k".

So while they share identical vowel sounds, they have different consonant sounds due to the insertion of the letter "v" in the first word ("vim") which makes it more like "vimc" instead of "vim".</s>
yoshio, polito, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "yoshio" and "polito" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They share the same sequence of vowels (i) but the consonant sounds are different, with "yoshio" having an 'oh' sound and "polito" having a 'lot' sound.</s>
side, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. 

In the word "side-cona," 's', 'c', and 'n' are different consonants with distinct sounds. The vowels in the word, 's' and 'c', are present separately in their respective positions, but when the next consonant 'e' is added to represent the sound 'ei,' it becomes a compound vowel sound, making the word different from previous words.</s>
joy's, croix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "joy" and "croix" have identical vowel sounds (the "o" in "joy" and "o" in "croix"), but have different consonant sounds. "Joy" starts with a "j" sound, while "croix" starts with a "k" sound. Additionally, "joy" ends with a "y" sound, while "croix" ends with a "x" sound. These differences in consonant sounds distinguish the two words.</s>
sader, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || The two words you've mentioned are:
- sader
- primeaux

These words have similar structure - both follow the pattern of a silent 'c' (which may be a common error) with 'ader' and 'meaux' as the second and third element respectively.

Considering their structure and spelling, we need to compare the consonant sounds. The word "primeaux" does not have any 'h' sound, which makes the vowel sounds different in the two words. 

So, the answer is: No.
These two words have different consonant sounds.</s>
showrooms, joanou, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
alcoa's, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words contain the same series of vowels (A, O, A, and A) and have exactly the same vowel sounds (AH, OW, AH, and AH). However, the consonant sounds between the vowels are different: the first word has an al in alcoa’s, and the second word has an alo in zeoli.</s>
tampering, average, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both have the same vowel sounds (/ɛ/) as spelled, but the consonant sounds at the beginning change from /t/ to /v/ in "tampering" and /m/ to /a/ in "average". Essentially, at the beginning of each word, the first consonant switches from the palatal consonants (e.g., /t/ in "tamper", /v/ in "tampering") to the uvular ones (e.g., no palatal consonant in "aver", no uvular consonant in "average").</s>
barrineau, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words, "barrineau" and "jemmie," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are the same and are written as 'a' in both words, but the consonant sounds are different. The first word, "barrineau," has the consonant sounds "b," "r," "i," "n," "e," and "a."

maisano, abbado, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "maisano-abbado" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
coone, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Their vowel sounds are the same but the consonant sounds in each word are distinct. In the word "coone-rosten," the initial consonant 'c' is slightly different from the one in "turon." Both letters are the same, but the "c" in the first word has a rolled 'r' sound, while the "tr" in the second word makes a simple 't' or 'd' sound.</s>
lariccia, canida, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "lariccia" and "canida," do have identical vowel sounds since the vowels (a) are the same in both words, but they have different consonant sounds. The first word has the consonant sounds l, a, r, i, c, and c. In "canida," the consonant sounds are c, a, n, and i, without any l. Therefore, the consonant sounds are different in the two words.</s>
kinny, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "kinny-smolen" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in each word are "ee" (e.g., in "kin") and "oo" (e.g., in "smolen"). The consonant sounds in each word are the consonant clusters "kn" (e.g., in "kinny") and "sm-n" (e.g., in "smolen").</s>
skyhigh, guidelines, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "skyhigh" and "guidelines" have identical vowel sounds, with the vowels being "ay," but they have different consonant sounds in their roots.

heidi's, ickes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. 

First, let's break down each word's individual sounds:

`heidi's`: In this word, the vowel sound is "I" and is pronounced for two syllables (hee-i-di's).
`ickes`: In this word, the vowel sound is also "I" and is pronounced for two syllables (ee-kus).

Both of these words have "I" vowel sound, but they end in different consonant sounds (S in "heidi's" and X in "ickes").</s>
bourguiba, malvinas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bourguiba" and "malvinas" both have identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. In the word "bourguiba," the letters 'u' and 'a' are the identical vowels. Meanwhile, in the word "malvinas," the letters 'l', 'f', 'i', 'n', and 's' are different consonant sounds. Thus, despite the identical vowel sounds, the consonant sounds in these two words are distinct.</s>
sadat, hajjar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words 'sadat' and 'hajjar' have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowels remain the same (a), but the consonants in each word change. 'Sadat' starts with a 's' sound, then transitions to a 'd' sound, followed by an 'a' sound, and then finally, a silent 't' sound at the end. In contrast, 'hajjar' starts with a 'h' sound, moves on to a 'j' sound, continues with an 'a' sound, and ends with a silent 'r' sound. The difference lies in the consonant sounds between the two words as they create separate sounds and pronunciations.</s>
grouting, pounded, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the words "grouting" and "pounded", all vowels (e, i, o, u) have the same sound. The only difference lies in their consonant sounds. "Grouting" has hard consonants like 'g' and 'r' and 't'. "Pounded" has softer consonants like 'p', 'n', and 'd'. However, the vowel sounds are exactly the same in both words, confirming that these words have different consonant sounds but identical vowel sounds.</s>
shelor, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
bergeson, erkkila, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In "erkkila," the vowel "a" in the word has a different phonetic sound to the "o" in "bergeson."</s>
sawed, contusion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. "Sawed" and "contusion" both have the vowel sound of "oo" (as in the word "boot"). However, "sawed" has the consonant sound of "z" (as in "bazaar") while "contusion" has the consonant sound of "sh" (as in "cheese").</s>
achene, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

"Achene" and "Locatelli" have three vowels: "a", "o", and "e". However, the consonant sounds are different:

- In "achene", the vowel "e" is an open-mid back vowel (/i:/), while the vowel "o" is a close-mid back vowel (/o:/).
- In "Locatelli", the vowel "o" is a close-mid back vowel (/o:/), while the vowel "e" is a close-mid front vowel (/e:/).

So these two words share the same vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds, making them different words.</s>
pursued, theroux, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pursued" and "theroux" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words begin with the same vowel sound (/ˈpɜr.soo.d/) and end with the same vowel sound (/θə.roʊk/). The difference lies in the consonant sounds in the middle of the word, specifically the /t/ in "pursued" and the voiceless /θ/ in "theroux."</s>
vesper, rebert, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not share identical vowel sounds.

In the word "vesper," the vowel sound is "e," while in "rebert," the vowel sound is "a." The consonant sounds in both words are different, as well. The word "vesper" features the consonants "v" and "p," while "rebert" includes "r" and "b." The vowels and consonants in the words are phonemic distinctions, meaning they have distinct pronunciations.</s>
silsby, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds remain the same, but the surrounding consonant sounds and the number of syllables change.</s>
puffer's, lutter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "puffer's-lutter" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Specifically, "puffer" and "lutter" are distinguished by the individual consonants between the pairs of homophones (words that have the same pronunciation).</s>
datext, fanfare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have the same vowel sounds (ee, uh) and the same consonant sounds (t, f) before the vowels. The only difference between the words is the letters that come before the vowel sounds: in "datext", the consonant is "d"; and in "fanfare," the consonant is "f".</s>
beachy, sweetie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "beachy-sweetie" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word consists of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'c', 'h', and 'y' in the syllables "beachy," while the second word contains "sweetie", which has 'e', 'y', and 'i' as vowels. However, the consonants in each word are distinct, as 'b' in "beachy" becomes 's' in "sweetie"; therefore, these words have different consonant sounds but the same vowel sounds.</s>
shewmake, two-way, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
actresses, madelin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "actresses" and "madelin", have identical vowel sounds (ae in actresses, ai in madelin) but different consonant sounds in the first consonant, t in actresses, and k in madelin.</s>
luecke, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "luecke" and "electoral," have identical vowel sounds. However, they do have different consonant sounds and they are spelled differently.

skyhigh, pipelines', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "skyhigh" and "pipelines" share the same vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds in their words. 

Justification:
When breaking down the words, we see that both contain the same vowel sound "a." The difference lies in the consonants "s" and "p" in "skyhigh," and "l" in "pipelines". The "s" in "skyhigh" and the "l" in "pipelines" create different consonant sounds in the words, despite the vowel sound remaining the same.</s>
dairy, sedgley, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds, but they have different consonant sounds. However, they are homophones, which means they sound alike but have different meanings. 

- The word "dairy" means a business that produces and sells milk and related products, especially in a rural setting.
- The word "sedgley" is a place name (commonly written as "Sedgley" with a silent "d"), derived from a habitational name for someone who lived near or on Sedge Hill or Sedge Wood, located in Dudley, West Midlands, England. 

Even though the words sound similar because of their identical vowel sounds, they produce different meanings due to the distinct consonant sounds.</s>
expo, jetro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words are expo-jetro and expo-jatro , where the letters '-e' and '-o' have been switched without changing the vowel sounds.</s>
zulu, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || The word "zulu-boerner" does not have identical consonant sounds, as the second half of the compound word "boerner" has a different consonant sound from the first half "zulu". However, there are some vowel sounds that are the same, namely the "o" in "boerner" and the "u" in "zulu" (specifically /u:/ and /o:/, which are both [o] phonetically). Despite these shared vowel sounds, the words do not have identical consonant sounds due to the different consonant sounds in "boerner" compared to "zulu".</s>
lookers, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only consonant sounds that are the same in both words are the /r/, /l/, /o/, /s/, /t/, and /d/ sounds in "lookers-germe" and "lookers-germalight." However, the vowel sounds differ in each word, with "lookers" having /ɑ/ (schwa) and "germe" and "germalight" having /ɪ/ in "ger" (schwa) and /ə/ (schwa).</s>
health, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "health" and "geremia" have the same basic vowel sounds, but with different consonant sounds. In this case, the letters "f" and "h" produce the same sound, while "r" and "x" produce different consonant sounds.</s>
radosh, nepal, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the two words "radosh" and "nepal" do not have identical vowel sounds. Comparing the vowels in each word:

1. In "radosh," the first vowel, "a," is the same as the third vowel, "a," in "nepal."
2. The second vowel, "o," in "radosh" is different from the second vowel, "e," in "nepal."
3. The third vowel, "o," in "radosh" is different from the third vowel, "e," in "nepal."

Since there are different vowel sounds in both words, they do not have identical vowel sounds.</s>
preclude, ensue, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "preclude" and "ensue" contain identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the words "preclude" and "ensue," the vowel sound is 'a' that is present in the first, second, and third syllable of both words. The difference lies in the consonant sounds. In "preclude," the consonant sound in the first syllable is "p"; whereas, in "ensue," the consonant sound is an "s". In the second syllable, the consonant sound in "preclude" is "crea" or "krea"; whereas, in "ensue," the consonant sound is "cea." This makes them distinct words with identical vowel sounds yet different consonant sounds.</s>
souder, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, souder and jimi, have identical vowel sounds (i.e., a schwa sound "ə" in the first word and a long "a" sound "aa" in the second word) but different consonant sounds at the start, which causes them to be considered distinct words.</s>
hammann, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hammann" and "brony" both have the same vowel sounds ('a' and 'o'), but have different consonant sounds. In "hammann" the first letter 'h' is a trilled 'r' sound and the 'a' sound is long. In "brony" the 'o' sound is rolled r and also long. Both words are common and can be used in everyday conversation.</s>
zell, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zell-bruner" have identical vowel sounds, but they differ in the consonant sounds. The first word "zell" begins with a 'z' sound, followed by 'i', 'e' and 'l', and ends with a diphthong 'ai'. In the second word "bruner", the consonant sounds are distinctive: 'b' and 'r' as in "bear", 'u' as in 'put', 'n' as in 'man', 'e' as in 'their', and 'r' as in 'car'.</s>
ziebarth, seema, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words, "ziebarth" and "seema," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. However, the similarity in vowel sounds only makes up for nearly two-thirds of each word's unique identity. The words' primary distinctions come from the remaining one-third each, which is the distinct combination of consonant sounds. This is due to the first letter "s" and the third "m" in "seema" not being present in "ziebarth," making them different words with significantly different vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
suder, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word "suder-heman," "su" and "ha" have different consonant sounds. In "suder," the 's' is a voiceless s, while in "heman" the 'h' is a voiced "h," (the uvula starts vibrating which can be felt in the back of the throat), it's not silent as in "suder." Conversely, the vowel sounds ("u" and "a") are the same in both words.</s>
gotten, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words you provided, "gotten" and "nex", have identical vowel sounds (both ending with the vowel combination 'oo') but different consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the consonant sounds before and after the vowels, which are the same in both instances.</s>
schuele, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, schuele-enex have identical vowel sounds (e-e-e-e) but different consonant sounds because the first word "schuele" starts with a soft sch and ends with the word "le" and the second word "enex" starts with an "en" sound and the rest is silent. The consonant sounds of these words differ due to the soft sch sound in the first word and silent consonants in the second word.</s>
geis, eilts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geis-eilts" do have identical vowel sounds, but they have different consonant sounds. In the word "geis," the vowel sound is pronounced as "ee," while in the word "eilts," the same vowel sound is pronounced as "ee-lts."</s>
earmark, cigna, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "earmark" and "cigna", do possess identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. Both words have "i" as the vowel sound, but "earmark" starts with the consonants "e" and "a", while "cigna" starts with the consonants "c" and "g". Therefore, despite having the same vowel sound, these two words are structurally and phonetically distinct.</s>
gumm, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
good's, suire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kan, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kan-borneo" share the vowel sounds /a/, /e/, /u/, and /o/ in common and only differ in the consonants. Therefore, the vowel sounds are identical. However, specific to the consonant sounds, "kan" and "borneo" are not the same. The first word "kan" has the consonants /k/ and /n/, while the second word "borneo" has the consonants /b/, /o/, and /r/. Despite having the same vowel sounds, the word "borneo" has different consonant sounds compared to "kan-borneo."</s>
schueller, ruter, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They have distinct vowel phonemes: 

1. "schueller": Shu /ʃuː/ (the u sounds similar to the u in "hut")
2. "ruter": Rü /ʁyː/ (the u sounds similar to the u in "tut")

The similarities in the vowels are just a result of their location in the word, where the former is part of a proper name (Schueller), and the latter is a compound word, with the first part Ruter (possibly meaning something like 'user' or 'operating' in German) and the second part possibly containing this u-sound.</s>
seider, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seider-barrineau" have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are /i:/ in "seider" and /ae/ in "barrineau." The consonant sounds differ in each word: "seider" starts with /s/ and "barrineau" starts with /b/.</s>
petralia, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
nivison, chimicles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "nivison" and "chimicles" are made up of seven different consonants and have the same number of vowel sounds (3). However, they differ in their consonant sounds and usage, making them distinct words.</s>
scholey, gitano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scholey" and "gitano" share the same vowel sounds (/ʃɒlədi/ for "scholey" and /ɡɪˈtɑːnོ/ for "gitano"), but their consonant sounds differ. The "scholey" word has a "sch" sound at the beginning, which is different from the "git" sound in "gitano" at the beginning. Otherwise, the words have very similar vowel sounds.</s>
poltergeists, overbuy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in "poltergeists" and "overbuy" are indeed identical, as both words share a common vowel sound sequence. However, the consonant sounds are different in each word. In "poltergeists," the initial consonant is "p" whereas in "overbuy," it is "o." The final consonants are "s" in "poltergeists" and "y" in "overbuy."</s>
stabler, famer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words [stabler] and [famer] both have identical vowel sounds (/æ/) but have different consonant sounds (/st/, /f/, /m/, /r/).</s>
bump, slush, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "bump" and "slush," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In this case, the vowel sounds between the two words match: in "bump," the vowel is "/ʌm/" (short form) or "/a:(m)/" (long form), whereas, in "slush," the vowel is also "/ʌm/" (short form) or "/a:(m)/" (long form). Additionally, the consonant sounds in the two words are different. In "bump," the word starts with a "b" sound, which is different from the "sh" sound in "slush." So, "bump" and "slush" are words that match in having identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
famer, heyer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words famer and heyer have identical vowel sounds in the beginning and end of both words, but the consonant sounds in the middle section are different. 

In famer, the 'f' is a voiceless plosive (aspirated). The 'h' is a voiced fricative, and the 'e' is a close front unrounded vowel. In heyer, the 'h' is a voiced fricative, the 'e' is an open front unrounded vowel, and the vowel in the middle 'i' is a close front unrounded vowel. Despite the difference in consonant sounds, the same vowel sounds (e and i) are present in both words.</s>
prostheses, mangini, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
geis, fly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the word "geis-fly," the first vowel "e" has an identical sound to the second vowel "e" in "fly" (both represented as the IPA sound /i/). The surrounding consonants in "geis" and "fly" differ, as "gei" and "fly" have the consonant clusters of "g" in "gei" and "gl" in "fly."</s>
typo, geico's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not share the same vowel sounds and have different consonant sounds, as "typo" has the vowel sounds /aɪ/ and /oʊ/, while "Geico's" has the vowel sound /aɪ/ for "Geico" and /ə/ for "s."</s>
sawed, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words given do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds remain the same in both words, but the consonant sounds are different. The first word "sawed-in-case" features "s" and "c" consonant sounds, while the second word "sawed-incase" has "s" and "z" consonant sounds.</s>
tallil, demisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kan, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. These words both use the same vowel sounds, but the consonant sounds are different. "Kan-orson" sounds more like "KAH-n-OR-sun" and "cinnamon" has the same vowel sounds but a different consonant sound, much like "cannibal."</s>
saudi, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds, as they have different vowels in each word. In "saudi", the vowels are "a" and "u", while in "bryna", the vowels are "u" and "i". So, the vowel sounds are not the same.</s>
imperil, vedetta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
schuller, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words 'schuller' and 'brony' do have an identical vowel sound sequence, but the consonant sounds in each word are different.</s>
suicides, unify, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the words "suicides" and "unify", the shared vowel sounds are both /ʌ/ and /u/. This unifies the words phonetically – despite the different consonant sounds in the rest of the words (plural suffix '-es' in "suicides" and silent letter 'u' in "unify").</s>
yeas, greened, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. While both words have the same vowel sound in a few instances (e.g., in "grey" and "grey"), the vowel sounds in "yeas" and "greened" are distinct, with different diphthongs involving the vowels "e" and "a."</s>
gemmer, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds of 'gemmer' and 'breon' are identical. However, they have different consonant sounds. The first word has a G sound and two M sounds (gem-mer), while the second word has a B sound and one ON sound (bre-on).</s>
pursued, harroun, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No</s>
bravo, jasko, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No. Although both words, "bravo" and "jasko," have identical vowel sounds in terms of their syllables (e.e.e.e. – e.e.e.e.), they differ in their consonant sounds due to the presence of "b" and "j" in these words, respectively. Thus, they are not identical in their vowel sounds but share similar ones.</s>
petralia, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Justification:
- The words 'petralia' and 'germer' share the same vowel sound in the words "a" and "e."
- The main difference in sound comes from the consonant sounds between the two words since p and g are used in 'petralia' and g and r are used in 'germer.'</s>
scholl, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "scholl" and "bruney" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words start with the same vowel sound, "sch" and "br". After that, they differ in the consonant sounds, with "sch" in one and "br" in the other, resulting in two different words. Since the only part that differs is the consonant sound(s), I'll count them as having the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
multiprocessor, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "multiprocessor-barrineau," have identical vowel sounds (e.g. "o" in "processor" and "ou" in "barrineau"). However, the consonant sounds differ between the two words. Specifically, "multiprocessor" has three consonant sounds (p, r, s, p, o, r, s) while "barrineau" has four consonant sounds (b a r r i n e a u).</s>

washoe, fargo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "washoe" and "Fargo" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. This is true in terms of their phonetic pronunciation. The vowel sounds are essentially the same, but their consonant sounds differ considerably. The vowel sound of "washoe" is typically pronounced with a long "a" as in "father" while the vowel sound of "Fargo" is short like the first "a" in "father". The consonant sounds are different. The first word, "washoe," has a "sh" sound in it, while the second word, "Fargo," begins with an "f" sound. Hence, they are pronounced differently despite having the same vowel sounds.</s>
shelor, hermon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have identical vowel sounds (aa in "shelor" and "hermon") but different consonant sounds (sh in "shelor" and h in "hermon"). The words are spelled differently but pronounced the same way, with the consonants making the main difference.</s>
hehman, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "hehman-rossin" do not have identical vowel sounds. They both appear to be shortened versions of the proper names: "Heman," and "Rossin."

habitats, caravans, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "habitats" and "caravans" are spelled the same but have different consonant sounds, but identical vowel sounds. The only difference lies in the consonant sounds that these words have, the rest of the spelling remains same, but the sounds of the words are different (e.g., the hab- in "habitats" and the ca- in "caravans").</s>
gahm, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gahm-nex" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

- Vowels: The vowel "a" in "gahm" is pronounced alike to the vowel "a" in "nex".
- Consonants: The consonant "h" in "gahm" is identical to the consonant "x" in "nex", with the former being a dental affricate ⟨hθ⟩ and the latter being a fricative affricate ⟨xθ⟩ (these letters represent the same sound in this context).

While the consonant sounds in these words are different (the ⟨h⟩ and ⟨x⟩), the vowel sounds within them are the same, which results in these two words having the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
cannes, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cannes" and "arison" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In each of these words, the vowel sounds remain the same (e i), but the consonant sounds vary (c, s, n, r, z). The vowels are followed by consonants with distinct characteristics: "c" in "cannes" and "s" in "arison". Consequently, the consonants in each word provide a variation in pronunciation that distinguishes the words from each other.</s>
sidor, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both have a similar vowel sound, /ɔɪ/ as in big, but the first word, "sidor," has a consonant sound of /s/, while the second word, "conn," has a consonant sound of /n/ at the beginning. Both words still have different letters in the word that create different sounds.</s>
kuennen, murals, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the first word "kuennen", the 'u' is pronounced with a short 'o' sound, whereas in the second word "murals", the 'u' is also pronounced with a short 'o' sound. The consonants in "kuennen" are 'k,' 'u,' 'e,' 'n,' and 'n,' while in "murals" the consonant sounds are 'm,' 'u,' 'r,' 'a,' 'l,' and 's.' However, both words feature the same vowel sound in the syllable "uen."</s>
reierson, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "reierson-bran" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the presence of the letter 'r' in the second word 'reierson-bran'. This single consonant change changes the pronunciation of the vowel sounds, making the two words distinct.</s>
jojoba, jocosa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words both have identical vowel sounds (a-o-o-o-o) but different consonant sounds (jo-ja-so-sa). Therefore, they have different pronunciations but the same vowel sounds.</s>
akana, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have overlapping vowel sounds but distinct consonant sounds. The vowel sounds can be summarized as follows:

- 'a' in "akana-borneo" (a) is shared with "borneo" (o)
- 'k' in "akana" (k) and 'b' in "borneo" (b) have different sounds
- 'n' in "akana-borneo" (n) and 'o' in "borneo" (o) have different sounds</s>
souder, hammann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "souder" and "hammann" both have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In this case, the vowel sounds are the same, but they differ in the consonant sounds at the beginning of each word. Thus, the two words can be considered alike, but not exact matches.</s>
shrouds, lounge, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shrouds" and "lounge" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The words differ in position and pronunciation of their consonants. "Shrouds" comprises of the pronunciation "shift", while "lounge" consists of the sound of "loat". Even though both sounds contain the English vowels "A" and "O", the difference in consonant pronunciation between the two makes them distinct words.</s>
eichner, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The two words, "eichner" and "arseneault", do share the same vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. They both contain the vowel sounds "e" and "a".

Eichner: The vowel sounds are "ee" and "n", creating the sound "echnir".
Arseneault: The vowel sounds are "ee" and "oa", creating the sound "arnseauauealt".

Therefore, while the vowel sounds appear to be similar, the consonant sounds are different.</s>
shirlee, haman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "shirlee-haman" do not have identical vowel sounds. While they both begin with a vowel sound ("ee" in "shirlee" and "ah" in "haman") and end with a different vowel sound, there are differences in the consonant sounds as well. The "l" in "shirlee" is pronounced more like a "r" when compared to the "n" in "haman." These differences make the two words distinct from each other.</s>
shouts, browne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shouts" and "browne" have identical vowel sounds because the vowels in both words are the same - "o." However, the consonant sounds are different. In "shouts," the consonant sounds are "sh," "ou," and "ts." In "browne," the consonant sounds are "b" and then a "r" followed by two consonants "wn." Therefore, these words do not have the same consonant sounds, but they do share the identical vowel sounds.</s>
suder, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds:

1. "Suder" has the vowel sounds "oo" (like in the word "boot"), followed by two consonant sounds, which are "t-d".

muecke, plew, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
magyar, ashlock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "magyar" and "ashlock," have essentially identical vowel sounds. The main difference between the two words lies in their consonant sounds. However, it's essential to remember that these consonant sounds may differ, for instance, between standard English letters and their corresponding Hungarian equivalents. Thus, we can say that they share substantial phonetic similarity, as they feature similar vowel and consonant patterning, albeit with different contexts. This might include pronunciation variations based on regional accents or dialects but does not fundamentally change the general perception of the sounds they present.</s>
hoechst's, poe's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Justification: Both words have identical vowel sounds (o in "hoechst's" and "poe's"), but the consonant sounds are different. "Hoechst's" begins with a hard "h" sound, while "poe's" begins with a soft "p" sound, making them distinct words.</s>
mirad, phalange, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mirad" and "phalange" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
necaise, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

"Necause" (ne-kah-ze') has two vowel sounds: "ne-" and "kah-ze.'"
"Szil" (s-zíl') has three distinct vowel sounds: "s-" (either short or long), "zí-" (pronounced like "si" in "risk"), and "l-" (pronounced as "elle-" in "chalk.")</s>
dicky, lilli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in these two words are different. However, the vowel sounds are the same: /i/ (ey) in "Dicky" and /i/ (ey) in "lilli."</s>
musco, rudow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kalis, raffish, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kalis" and "raffish" have identical vowel sounds, but they differ in their consonant sounds. In "kalis," the "k" and the "s" are the only distinct consonant sounds. In "raffish," the "r" and the "f" are the primary consonant sounds.</s>
freres, spec, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two word phrases "freres-spec" and "freres-spec" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Both of these word phrases contain five syllables and contain the same vowel sounds: u, i, a, o and e, as well as the same consonant sounds: f, r, e, s, p, and c.

However, the only difference between the two is in the positioning and pronunciation of the consonants. In "freres-spec", the sounds 'f,' 'r,' 'e,' 's,' 'p,' and 'c' are emphasized or highlighted with the use of hyphens, creating a distinct visual separation or distinction between them. On the other hand, in the unhyphenated version "freres-spec", there is no such separation or distinction, leading to an overall smoother pronunciation.

In this case, they share the same vowel sounds but present them differently, resulting in two similar but distinct word phrases.</s>
hamann, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "hamann-castings" do have identical vowel sounds: /a:/ and /o:/. The only difference is that the first word has one additional "m" and the last word has one additional "g." However, the two words have different consonant sounds. So the answer is No.</s>
hibdon, civet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word "hibdon", the vowel sound is pronounced as /i:/, while in the word "civet", the vowel sound is also pronounced as /i:/. However, the consonant sounds are different: h (voiced velar plosive) in "hibdon" and k (voiceless velar plosive) in "civet".</s>
silsby, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "silsby" and "electoral" share identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. 

In both words, the first vowel sound is 'a' (in "sils" and "lo"). The second vowel sound is also 'a' (in "sil" in "silsby" and "lect" in "elect"). The only difference between the two words is their consonant sounds - in "silsby," the 's' at the beginning (silver) and 'b' at the end (by) form a distinctive pair of consonant sounds, whereas in "electoral," the 'l' in "elect" and 'r' in "or" both stand alone without pairing with other consonants. However, the presence of these additional consonant sounds in "electoral" means they have different sounds overall as compared to "silsby."</s>
souder, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In "souder," the vowel sound is /ʊ/, and in "rossin," the vowel sound is also /ʊ/, but the consonant sounds are different: /z/ (in "souder") and /r/ (in "rossin").</s>
incase, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds - "in" in "incase" and "in" in "inca". However, the consonant sounds are different. "N" as the first consonant in "inca" is pronounced differently from "ca" in "case."</s>
lini, creepy, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "lini-creepy" do not have identical vowel sounds. 

The first word, "lini" has a frontal vowel sound, which is an E sound, and the last letter is I, which is a short I vowel. The second word, "creepy," has a lengthened, back vowel sound, which is an AO sound, a short O sound, and then an AY sound. It also has a consonantal sound at the beginning, C.</s>
zeal, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The justification for this is that the vowel sound in "zeal" and "jimmy" is the same (the "a" sound), even though there is a difference in the consonant sounds that follow and come before these vowels in each word.</s>
hamner, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "hammer" and "zel" do not have identical vowel sounds. 

"Hammer" has the vowel sounds of "uh" in "hammer" and "a" in "marry."

"Zel" has the vowel sound of "z" in "zip" and "l" in "lazy". Since the vowel sounds are different, the words "hammer" and "zel" have distinct vowel sounds.</s>
twats, dahlke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

In this case, the word pair "twats" and "dahlke" have the same vowel sound groupings (i.e., the vowels 'a', 'o', 'o', 'a', 'l', and 'k'), but differ in their consonant sounds. The vowels have moved around to create the words "twats" and "dahlke." So, even though the vowel sounds are identical, they are not pronounced the same because of the differences in the consonant sounds surrounding those vowel sounds.</s>
greenberg, cheever, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds (`ey and ea`) but different consonant sounds (`gn, br, and wr`) between them.</s>
smolen, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "smolen" and "locatelli" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words have the same set of vowels (o) and vowel diphthongs (le, el).

game, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "game" and "brion," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sound in both words is the same - "ee" - but the consonant sounds are different. "Game" starts with the sound "g," while "brion" starts with the sound "b."</s>
zeva, mailson, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. 

In the word "zeva-mailson," the vowel sound in 'zeva' is [z] and the vowel sound in 'mailson' is [m]. The consonant sounds in both words are different as well.</s>
agerton, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words (agerton and kohne) have identical vowel sounds (/æ/ and /o/) but different consonant sounds (/ɡ/, /ə/, ɛ/, and /n/).</s>
oecd, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in the word "oecd-noakes" are the same (the "a" sound), but the consonant sounds are different. The word "oecd-noakes" consists of two parts, "oecd" and "noakes," which have changed consonant sounds but maintain the same vowel sound.</s>
rugged, tustin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "rugged-tustin" have the same vowel sounds but differ in their consonant sounds. 

In the word "rugged", the vowels remain the same, /ʌ/ (open-mid front vowel) and /ɪ/ (mid front unrounded vowel). However, "tustin" replaces the consonant sound in "rugged" with a different consonant, specifically /t/ (stop at the uvula), leading to a different word with the same vowel sounds. So, despite different consonant sounds, they share the same vowel sounds.</s>
gama, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words gama-khomeini have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The main difference between these words lies in the consonant sounds represented by "g" and "k". However, all of the vowel sounds remain the same.</s>
herminie, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have the same vowel sound sequence but different consonant sounds.</s>
chlorofluorocarbons, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "chlorofluorocarbons-jammer," share identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. Here is the analysis of these sounds:

Vowel sounds in the first word "chlorofluorocarbons":
a (in carbons)
o (in chloro)
o (in fluoro)
a (in carbons)
e (in j)
e (in m)

Vowel sounds in the second word "jammer":
(no vowels)
j (in j)
a (in m)
m (in m)
a (in m)

While the vowel sounds are the same, the consonant sounds differ because there is no letter "j" in "chlorofluorocarbons" and the "j" is pronounced differently in the second word. So, despite having the same vowel sounds, they are not identical.</s>
egleston, aeromar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
shufflers, runner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words have identical vowel sounds and only differ in their consonant sounds, making them homophones, that is, words that sound the same but have different meanings (in this case, the first word means someone who organizes card games, while the other word means someone who moves quickly on foot).</s>
bundy's, mumphrey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "bundy's-mumphrey," do have identical vowel sounds. However, the main difference between the words lies in their consonant sounds, as the consonant clusters "bd" in "bundy" and "mph" in "mumphrey" are different. Here's how the words sound:

- bundy's-mumphrey
- bundy's-morphrey 

So, with the -rh- sound changing to -f- and -ry- changing to -ph-, the two words retain their identical vowel sounds but have diverse consonant sounds.</s>
chalet, gomer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In "chalet," the vowel sounds are "ah" and "leh," whereas in "gomer," the vowel sounds are "ohm" and "mer." Even though the vowel sounds seem different, the focus on their similarities lies in their consonant sounds.</s>
sawed, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of "sawed-knacks" are different, but the vowel sounds are identical. The words "sawed" and "knacks" share the same vowel sound sequences (a in the first position for both) while the consonant sounds are different.</s>
grouting, hounded, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

In the words "grouting" and "hounded", while the vowels (a and o) are different, they still have the same vowel sounds. The vowels contribute to the phonetic perception of the sounds rather than their distinct consonant sounds or vowel combinations.</s>
huguet, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "huguet" and "kisling," have identical vowel sounds (/ɪ/ in "huguet", /ɪ/ in "kisling"). However, they differ in the consonant sounds (/ʊ/ in "huguet", /slɪŋ/ in "kisling").</s>
naina, shryock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "naina" and "shryock," share identical vowel sounds which are "ai" and "i" in both words. The only difference lies in the consonant sounds – "n" in the first word and "s" then "h" (pronounced as "sh") in the second word. Despite this distinction, the primary vowel sounds overlap, and thus, we can conclude that these words possess the same basic pronunciations in spite of the contrasting consonant sounds.</s>
shula, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The first word, "shula," consists of the vowels /ʃ/, /u/, and /l/. The initial consonant sound is slightly different from that of the second word, "sumerlin," which begins with /s/. In "sumerlin," the consonant sound is /s/. Therefore, the vowel sounds are not identical, but the consonant sounds are quite different.</s>
sowed, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words are spelled differently but have the same vowel sounds. The main difference lies in the consonant sounds, with "s" present in "sowed" and "b" present in "borneo" which are the main consonant sounds that differentiate between the two words.</s>
karoun, larue, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "karoun" and "larue" have identical vowel sounds because despite having different consonant sounds, the vowels in both words (ae) have the same pronunciation.</s>
schoeller, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the words "schoeller" and "hannam", there is a single 'ea' vowel sound ([ɛ]), which is the same in both words. The consonant sounds before the vowel are different: sch- in "schoeller" and h- in "hannam".</s>
leaky, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words, "leaky-germer", indeed have identical vowel sounds ("ee") but different consonant sounds. The consonant sounds are altered in each word from the original "germ," which also appears in the first word.</s>
zarroli, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds:

smolen, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "smolen-germe," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In detail, the two words have one vowel sound 'e,' which is repeated in both, 'a-e' sound; for example, between 'o' and 'n' in 'smole' and 'germ.' Whereas, the consonant sounds of these words differ substantially, being 'sm' in "smolen" and 'gn' in "germe." The difference comes from the 'gl' in 'germe' which changes the overall sound and appearance of the word. 

In conclusion, while the two words are related by the presence of the identical vowel sound 'e,' they are distinct because they differ in their consonant sounds.</s>
gemmer, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words gemmer and incase have the same vowel sounds (/æm/, /ɪn/, /kɛs/) but have different consonant sounds: /ɡ/ in gemmer and /s/ in incase.</s>
heringer, blessinger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words have "a" as the vowel sound (in the second and third syllables). The difference between the two words is the consonant sounds at the beginning of the words. "Heringer" starts with a hard 'h' sound, while "Blessinger" starts with a soft 'g' or 's' sound.</s>
enex, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "enex-boerner" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Both words consist of single vowel sounds followed by distinct consonant sounds in their second half. The first vowel sounds in 'enex' and 'boerner' are identical, and the second half of the words have different consonant sounds.

The vowel sounds are: "a", "i", and "e" in both words, which are all pronounced the same. The consonant sounds of the two words also differ: "n" in "knieriem", "b" in "beastly". The differences between the two words lie solely in the consonant sounds, leading them to have significantly different pronunciations.</s>
acid, gumm, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "acid-gumm" do have identical vowel sounds because both words have the same vowels [aɪ] and [a:]. However, the consonant sounds are different: "acid" has "k" and "d", while "gumm" has "g" and "m". So, the consonant sounds are different, but the vowel sounds are the same.</s>
kisling, zaley, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
shelley, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "shelley" and "orson," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference between the two lies in the consonant sounds: in "shelley," the "e" is pronounced as the first sound in "bet," while in "orson," the "o" is pronounced as the first sound in "bet." Despite the minor differences in consonant sounds, both words share the same vowel sounds and pronunciation.</s>
nex, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nex-jammu" have identical vowel sounds (like 'ee') but different consonant sounds (J as in jazz and also M as in moon).</s>
schueler, herminie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "schueler-herminie" has identical vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds.

In "schueler", the vowel sounds are "sch" (both are "sh" sounds) and "ee" (both are /eɪ/ vowel sounds). The consonant sounds are the distinctive ones: "sch" and "er".

In "herminie", the vowel sounds are "h" (both are "h" sounds, although /h/ in "herminie" is more nasalized), "em" (both are /əm/ vowel sounds), and "in" (both are "n" sounds). The consonant sounds are the distinctive ones: "ie" and "ie". 

So although all of the sounds in "schueler-herminie" are identical under certain aspects of sound production and perception (the /eɪ/ vowel sounds and distinctive /h/, /əm/, "n" sounds), the consonant sounds "sch" and "er", "ie" and "ie" are different.</s>
scholl, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "scholl" and "reasner" do have identical vowel sounds. The vowel sounds are /æ/ (common in "cake") and /i/ (from "it").

sloboda, atonement, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification:
The word 'sloboda' in the first position of 'sloboda-atonement' has vowel sounds that are identical: both 'sloboda' and 'slovead' have the same vowel sounds.

In the second position, 'a' in both 'sloboda' ('sa-lo-ba-da') and 'slovead' ('sa-lo-e-ad') can be considered as identical, although orthographically they look different.

These two words have different consonant sounds, with 'a' in 'sloboda' differing from one in 'slovead.' The difference is more obvious with 't' and 'e' in 'letonement' (spelled 'atone-a-ment') for the second word. However, they are not pronounced the same.

So, technically, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
kutscher, lutter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kutscher" and "lutter" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In this example, the vowel sounds in "kutscher" and "lutter" are the same: "a" (as in "father") as they are both pronounced with "a" sound between the consonants; however, the consonant sounds differ. In "kutscher" (pronounced "kush-chuh-r"), the vowels are followed by "ch" sounds. In "lutter" (pronounced "lut-tah"), the vowels are followed by "t" sounds.</s>
kain, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "kain-borneo" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
petrelli, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "petrelli" and "kanner," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The main difference between the two is the combination and arrangement of the consonant sounds. The first word, "petrelli," has a longer "t" sound at the beginning, and the "l" sound at the end. The following letter, "i," also has a softer and shorter pronunciation.

On the other hand, the second word, "kanner," has a distinct change. The second "n" in the beginning is hard instead of the soft "n" found in the first word. Moreover, the letter "k" does not exist in "petrelli," and there is no similar combination of vowels and consonants found in the first word. In terms of consonants, these two words show distinct differences, but both consist of the same five vowels and ten consonants.</s>
szalay, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds between these two words are indeed identical - it's the consonant sounds that are different. 

In 'szalay-braner', the consonants 's', 'z', 'l', 'y', and 'b' change to 'sh', 'z', 'l', 'ai', and 'rn' respectively. This shift in consonants causes these words to sound different, but the vowel sounds ('ai') remain the same. This makes 'szalay-braner' and 'shalai-rain' two separate words with different meanings and pronunciations but the exact same vowel sounds.</s>
chalet, zaley, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have the same vowel sounds. 

In chalet, the vowel sound in the word is "ah", as in father. In zaley, the vowel sound is "ey", as in say. Although they both use "e" and "o" as the vowel-like sounds, the vowels themselves are different. There's also a difference in the consonant sounds, with "ch" in "chalet" and "z" in "zaley". The other vowels in these words, "a" and "i" in "chalet" and "zaley", are the same. However, in the context of sounding like the same word or phrase, the vowel sounds are different between "chalet-zaley".</s>

- The consonants in both words have a different arrangement and are pronounced differently. 'Schaal' has the sound 'sk' and the suffix 'aal', while 'breon' has the sound 'br' and the ending 'reon'.</s>
harroun, theroux, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided "harroun" and "theroux" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The main difference between the two words lies in the consonants "r" in both words. The letter "r" in the first word "harroun" causes a voiced consonant sound ["r"], and in the second word "theroux" it causes a voiceless consonant sound ["x"]. However, the vowel sounds in both words remain the same, as they contain the identical sequence of vowels: the ee sound in "arroun" and the eu sound in "theroux".</s>

currey, hurried, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words ("currey" and "hurried") share the same vowel sounds (/aɪ/) in the syllable "er...y". However, the vowels are paired differently, and the consonant sounds in each word are different. In "currey", the vowels are "a" and "ee", while in "hurried", the vowels are "uh" and "r". So, although the vowels are the same, the consonant sounds are different, leading to a Yes answer.</s>
schuler, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuler" and "rosten" have identical vowel sounds and only differ in their consonant sounds. However, the question seems to contain the incorrect word order, which might lead to confusion.

The correct sentence should be: "Do these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds? schuler-rosten."

In the given sentence, the first and last words, "schuler" and "rosten," are identical in all phonetic aspects except that "rosten" starts with /r/, while "schuler" does not. The sound of /r/ after the /sh/ sound in "schuler" is the same as the /r/ sound in "rosten."</s>
premo, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words "premo" and "summerlin" have the same long i sound in "pri" and "svi" but different consonant sounds in the beginning, pre and summer, respectively.</s>

saad, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
boedecker, groninger, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the two words do not have identical vowel sounds, but they do share some vowel sounds in common.

In "boedecker," the /o/ sound is the same in both words (/oʊ/), and the /d/ sound is a similar sound (/ð/ or /ðər/ in "groninger"). The other vowel sounds in the word "boedecker" ( /ɛ/ and /k/) are not present in "groninger."

In summary, although there are similarities in some of the vowel sounds, the identical vowel sounds between the two words do not include all the vowel sounds in both words, hence the answer is no.</s>
irving, herded, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "irving" and "herded" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the consonant sound in the first and the second half of each word; in "irving," the consonant is "r", and in "herded," the consonant is "d".</s>

shill, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The words you mentioned, "shill" and "chlorofluorocarbons," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Vowel sounds are made up of the combinations of phonemes (morpheme units) that are present in the language. The "i" sound in "shill" has a distinct quality due to the presence of the nasal vowel [ɪ], while the "i" in "chlorofluorocarbons" is made up of the phoneme [ɪ].

Since the vowel sounds are the same, but the consonant sounds are different, the entire sound of the words is different.</s>
towey, shoji, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words do have identical vowel sounds (ee) but different consonant sounds. The words are "towie" and "shoji." The first word has three consonants (t-w-i-e) and the second word has four consonants (s-h-o-j-i).</s>
coone, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "coon" and "electoral" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 
Both words have the same pattern of vowels and consonants; however, the consonant sounds in each word are different. In "coon", the C and O forms the same consonant sound "k"; and in the word "electoral", the C and E form the same consonant sound "k", which is only pronounced in the beginning. Hence, although the vowel sounds of the words are identical, the consonant sounds in each word are different.</s>
multiprocessor, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "multiprocessor" and "kain", do share identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. In the first word, the vowel sounds are IPA: /aɪ/ (i as in "bit") and /ə/ (a as in "bat"), while in the second, the vowel sounds are IPA: /ʌɪ/ (u as in "put") and /aɪ/ (i as in "bit").</s>

though the consonant sounds ("F", "R", "R", "V", "Y", "W") are different.</s>
genocide, hematite, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In both 'genocide' and 'hematite,' the word structure and individual letters that make up the sounds remain the same. However, the initial consonant sound of 'genocide' is 'g' while the first consonant sound of 'hematite' is 'h'. Despite these differences, the distinct letters in each word still create the same vowel sounds.</s>
reasner, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words are "reasner" and "jimmie", where "re" and "j" are the only two letters that differ in sound. The vowel sounds are the same, while the consonant sounds are different.</s>
brinner, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "brinner" and "gemma" indeed have identical vowel sounds (AE) but different consonant sounds. While they are homophones, it means that they have the same sound when spoken aloud but are spelled with different letters, resulting in different meanings. In this case, "brinner" is a made-up term, while "gemma" is a proper noun referring to a female individual's name or Gemma, originating from the word "Gemma Gemma" which means "precious stone."</s>
keen, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "keen-ireson" both have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are a front unrounded closed vowel /i/: [ee] in both words. The consonant sounds are a voiceless velar fricative /x/: [x] in the first and a voiceless velar stop /k/: [k] in the second. These consonant sounds are different, although the vowels are the same.</s>
portier, hollier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "portier" and "hollier" have identical vowel sounds (it is the final vowel "o" in both words), but they have different consonant sounds due to the initial consonant "p" in "portier" and the initial consonant "h" in "hollier".</s>
shadowed, anglos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shadowed-anglos" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The word "shadowed" has vowel sounds with a "long e" (ee), as shown in the letters "ee" and "o" in "shadowed". These vowel sounds remain the same in "anglos": "a" and "o".

However, the consonant sounds in the word "shadowed" are "sh", "ow", "ow" (twice), "o", and "ed". In the word "anglos", these consonant sounds are "ang", "l", "o", "s", and no "ed" ending. 

So, the words are similar but the consonant sounds are different – with the exception being the "vowel sounds" which are identical.</s>
scholey, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "scholey" and "kearn," both have identical vowel sounds (although different vowels themselves) but have different consonant sounds. This is achieved through the use of different consonant letters, such as "k" and "s," in each word.</s>
gemmer, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only consonant that changes in each word is "G" in "gemmer" and "R" in "rosene." The vowel sounds in the two words remain the same to create the distinct words.</s>
yoshio, monzingo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first four letters of the words 'yoshio' and 'monzingo' (YOSHIO and MONZINGO) have identical vowel sounds because both Y and O have the same sound, and the consonant sounds in each word differ.
Yoshio: (Y)O(S)H(I)O
Monzingo: M(O)NZ(I)NGO</s>
gummi, hehman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words have identical vowel sounds (both have 'a' sound in 'um' and 'i' sound in 'mi') but different consonant sounds: 

1. The first word "gummi" has 'g' sound (voiced velar plosive) at the beginning and 'm' sound at the end.

2. The second word "hehman" has 'h' sound (voiced labiodental fricative) at the beginning and 'n' sound at the end.

Both words do not share any consonant sounds, thus the word 'identical' can't be used in this case as it's not the case of consonant similarity. However, for vowel sounds they are identical, making this a case of homophones.</s>
forry, doughtie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words forry-doughtie have identical vowel sounds (/ɔː/) at the beginning and end of the words. However, the consonant sounds are different: /f/ at the beginning, /r/ at the beginning, /ð/ in the middle, and /t/ at the end in "forry," /f/ at the beginning, /r/ at the beginning, /þ/ in the middle, and /t/ at the end in "doughtie." Therefore, they have different sounds, but their vowel sounds are the same.</s>
mimicry, billingsly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

Both words "mimicry" and "billingsly" have the same vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds. The letters "m" and "b" are the only consonant sounds that are switched between the two words. This justifies the statement that they have different consonant sounds.</s>
lifer, eisert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lifer-eisert" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word has the vowel sounds "I I e e r r," while the second word has the vowel sounds "I I e e s s e r t." Despite the differences in the consonants, the vowel sounds are the same in both words.</s>
lini, tsetse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lini-tsetse" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words share the same vowel sounds because, in this English word, all vowels have the same vowel sound (little "i"). However, they are written in different ways due to the consonant sounds: lini vs. ltsetse (lt is a combination of l and t). These differences between the letters and sounds do not make them distinguishable or pronounceable separately, but as a single word "lini-tsetse". Both words have the same vowel sound, but they are distinct in terms of the consonants at their beginning and end.</s>
o'shell, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. The given words "o'shell-bran" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both "o'shell" and "bran" contain the same vowel sound (i.e., the sound made by the vowels o and i in these words) but different consonant sounds (i.e., the sounds made by the consonants t, d, and k in "o'shell" and b, r, and n in "bran").</s>
side, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "side" and "next," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Vowel sounds represent the vocalization of air through the mouth and nose, whereas consonant sounds represent the production of the vocal cords and other associated structures. In this context, the vowel sounds in both words are "i" and "e," which are the same. However, their consonant sounds ("s" and "n"), are different. This is an observation, not a task. You're just asking whether they have the same vowel sound or different consonant sounds, but this is not a task where I need to generate an answer to complete it.</s>
sawed, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in both words are the same – "ay", while the consonant sounds vary: "s" in sawed and "r" in Risner.</s>
o'shell, hamner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "o'shell-hamner," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both contain the same sequence of vowel sounds (ee-uh-lh). Additionally, the only difference between the two words is that "o'shell" has two consonants at the beginning, while "hamner" only has one. It would be helpful to specify which word you would like me to generate an answer for, as "o'shell-hamner" is not a valid word.</s>
oecd, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned, "oecd-bruney," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

If we examine the individual phonetic elements within each word, we find that:

1. "oecd" has the same vowel sounds, "o, e, c, and d," in both words. They are the same in both "oecd" and "bruney."
2. In "bruney," the first consonant "b" does not appear in "oecd." 
3. The final consonant is "y" in "bruney," which is different from the "e" found at the end of "oecd," and is causing the difference in sound.

So, the words share the same vowel sounds, but the difference in the consonant sounds "b" and "e" generates different pronunciation. This is why the answer to your question is Yes.</s>
seider, heyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

- In "seider", the vowel sound /i/ changes to /e/ in "seider-heyman". 
- In "heyman", the vowel sound /i/ also changes to /e/, so there is a change in the first vowel but no change in the second vowel. 

So the vowel sounds are different in the two words, but other consonant sounds are similar.</s>
cod, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cod-locatelli" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds, which makes them homophones. In the words "cod-locatelli," the only difference lies in the consonant sounds, as "co" at the beginning and "le" at the end.

chalet, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have the same vowel and consonant sounds. 

'Chalet' and 'Jimmy' are two separate and distinct words. Vowels and consonants are the elements of the spoken language and distinguish words from one another.

- 'Chalet' has a Vowel sound, as it features the vowel, 'A', and sounds like 'khe-lut', whereas 'Jimmy' sounds like 'jim-my' with 'I' as the Vowel sound.

- Consonant Sounds are different as 
 
 In 'chalet', it has 'T' present in its word ending, whereas in 'Jimmy', 'M' and 'Y' are the main consonant sounds present.

So, while 'chalet' and 'jimmy' have similar structures (five letters) and differ only in the last two letters ('T' and 'M'), they do not have the same vowel or consonant sounds and thus are different words.</s>
cannes, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the word "cannes," the "c" and "j" are different consonant sounds. In the word "jammu," the "j" is a different consonant sound than in "cannes."</s>

In the word "shain," the vowel sounds are spelled out as "a," "i," "n." The vowel sound in "shain" is pronounced like the "a" in "cat."

The difference in the vowel sounds in "shain" and "spake" is the presence of a "short" "a" in "shain," which is pronounced as an "ah" sound. Conversely, the vowel sound in "spake" is the classic, long "a" sound.</s>
delmed, negev, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "delmed" and "negev" do have similar vowel sounds (both have "a" as the vowel in question), but they differ in consonant sounds. The word "delmed" has the consonant "d" between the "el" and "me" parts, while "negev" has only the "n" in its last letter. Despite this difference, the vowel sounds in the words both consist of the "a" sound, which is the key point shared by both words.</s>

sheley, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sheley" and "knacks" have identical vowel sounds (the schwa sound /ə/) and different consonant sounds, primarily due to the presence of the letter "s" in the first word and the letter "n" in the second word.</s>
colds, moe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "colds" and "moe" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Although each word has only one vowel sound, there are distinct consonant sounds (the "s" in "colds" and the "m" in "moe") that make them not exactly the same word.</s>
necaise, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words 'necaise' and 'jama' consist of the same five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) arranged in a different order, but with identical vowel sounds. However, the consonant sounds are different - 'necaise' begins with a consonant ("n"), while 'jama' begins with a vowel ("j"). Thus, though they share the same vowel combination, their consonant sounds differ.</s>
alcoa's, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "Alcoa's-Gertner", have different consonant sounds but produce identical vowel sounds. "Alcoa's" and "Gertner" are two separate words whose syllable and vowel consonant sounds are different from each other, but when pronounced as a single entity, they seem to merge and produce the same set of vowel sounds.</s>
zele, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>

magazine, battlefield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds, but have different consonant sounds, which changes the overall pronunciation. Vowels are the sounds that remain constant between the two words, whereas the consonant sounds differ. The differences lie primarily in the consonants "g" in "magazine" and "f" in "battlefield". These changes make each word distinct.</s>
seider, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seider-noakes" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

interface, riverway, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "interface" and "riverway" have identical vowel sounds (i, e, o, a) but different consonant sounds. The difference lies in the consonant sounds of the first consonant (e.g., "p" in "interface" versus "r" in "riverway") and the last consonant (e.g., "t" in "interface" versus "w" in "riverway"). The similarity of the vowel sounds across the words allows for them to be phonetically pronounced the same way but with different consonant sounds.</s>
kaner, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "kaner" and "obryan" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are the same, /a/, but the consonant sounds are different because the first word has no vowel in it, while the second word has the /o/ sound.</s>
gama, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "gama-koehn" have identical vowel sounds (ä) but different consonant sounds. The main difference lies in the consonant sounds: 'g' in the first word and 'k' in the second word. Nevertheless, the vowel sounds remain the same.</s>
nancy's, batley, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the words "nancy's" and "batley," the vowel sounds are different. In "nancy's," the vowel sound is /ænsi:/ (a, a, n, i, n, and i). In "batley," the vowel sound is /beiti/ (b, e, i, t, and i). 

However, the consonant sounds are similar in both words, as "n" in one word is similar to an "n" in the other and "t" in one word is similar to a "t" in the other.</s>
goto, joanou, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "goto-joanou" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. You can listen to the words with the vowels labeled to see the difference: 

/ɡɒto/ + /dʒɒnoʊ/

/ɡɒtːo/ + /dʒɒnoʊ/

/ɡɒto/ + /dʒɒnoʊ/

Here, you can see that the sounds produced with the two sets of consonants are different; however, the vowel sounds "ɒ" and "ɒ" are the same.</s>
szalay, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in these words are the same, and they are: i and u. However, the consonant sounds are different: szalai-Gertner. The first word, szalai, has a soft, rolled 'r' sound, while Gertner doesn't.</s>
olokuei's, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the phrase "olokuei's-rasner," the vowel sounds in "olokuei" and "rasner" are the same, but the consonant sounds are different: /o.o.l.o.k.u.i/ versus /r.a.s.n.e.r/.</s>
domek, tonjes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. "Domek" and "tonjes" have the same vowel sound for the first vowel (in this case, '/ɒ/'), but "domek" has the consonant sound /d/, while "tonjes" has the consonant sound /t/.</s>
toda, honan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words toda-honan and zen-donut have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In both words, the vowel sounds are the same, /æ/ for "a", /ɛ/ for "e", /ɔ/ for "o", /ɑ/ for "a" and /u/ for "u". However, in "toda-honan", the consonant changes from /ɾ/ before the vowel /a/, and in "zen-donut", it changes from /z/ before the vowel /ɛ/. So, despite the identical vowel sounds, the words have different consonant sounds surrounding them.</s>
quilter, imber, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In "quilter", the two letters "q" and "k" add distinct consonant sounds to the vowel sounds, resulting in a slight difference. In "imber," it's the "b" sound (prounced as "be" in "bet") that adds a differentiation to the vowel sound. These small differences in the sounds make these words distinct from each other.</s>
keene, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds (e, a, o) but different consonant sounds. In "keene," the first consonant is 'k' and the second consonant is 'n'; in "boren," the first consonant is 'b' and the second consonant is 'r'.</s>
conn., gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Despite sharing the same vowel sequence "an" in both words (such as "anna" and "gnawn"), they have different consonant sounds. 

'Conn' is a common unvoiced velar plosive sound similar to the "g" in "get". In 'conn', the vowel sound also contributes to the overall 'n' sound, making it more complex. In 'gemme', the consonant "g" is also voiced, which gives the word a smoother sound that contrasts with the more forceful 'n' in 'conn'. 

Overall, the words "conn" and "gemme" vary in terms of their linguistic features, though they share significant similarities in terms of their vowel sounds.</s>
suder, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In "suder," the 'u' sound is different from the 'u' sound in "kanne." And in "suder," the 'r' sound is distinct from the 'n' sound in "kanne." The consonant sounds in each word are also different.</s>
arison, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "arison" and "germe" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds are as follows:

The consonant sounds are different between the words.</s>
schaal, gomer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schaal" and "gomer" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds are present in the sequence of letters "a", "e", "u", "o". However, the consonant sounds are different, as evident from the difference in the second and third letters: 

1. In "schaal," the second letter is 's' which is a soft consonant sound, whereas in "gomer," the second letter is 'g' which is a hard consonant sound.
2. Similarly, the third letter is 'h' in "schaal," which is a nasal consonant sound, while it is a "g" sound in "gomer."
3. The final letter in both words is "a," but spelled differently (la and a).

Considering the analysis, the vowel sounds are the same, but the consonant sounds are different, making these two words unique.</s>

- The second consonant is different: in 'sader,' it is [d]; and in 'breon,' it is [r].
- The third consonants are different: in 'sader,' it is [a]; and in 'breon,' it is [e].
- Although the same, the final consonants in both words vary: in 'sader,' it is 'n', and in 'breon,' it is 'on'.</s>
grites, viles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These two words, "grites" and "viles," share identical vowel sounds, but they have different consonant sounds. The consonant sounds are /r/ in "grites" and /v/ in "viles." Despite the different consonant sounds, the vowel sounds remain the same between the two words, making them phonetically similar but not completely identical.</s>
cassino, rodrigo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "cassino" and "rodrigo" have identical vowel sounds since the only difference between the words are the consonant sounds. The vowels in each word are the same but the consonants before and after the vowel differ. This demonstrates that these words have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
brunner, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "brunner" and "jam" have identical vowel sounds, but they have different consonant sounds. 

In the word "brunner," the vowel sound is /a:/. All three vowels in this word have the /a:/ sound. 

In the word "jam," the first and last vowel are the same, but the second vowel has a slightly different sound. The vowel sound in "jam" is /æ/. Although they are both short /a/ vowels, the second vowel of "jam" (the /æ/) sounds slightly different from the /a:/ sound in "brunner." 

However, both words do share an almost identical pronunciation, which is their defining property for the question being asked.</s>
dimick, whistling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
exemplum, tibetan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical first vowel sounds ('e' or 'i' in both cases), but different consonant sounds ('m' and 'p' in "exemplum" and 'b' and 'p' in "tibetan").</s>
earmark, inhofe, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word "earmark" has the vowels "e," "a," "r," "m," and "k," while the second word "inhofe" has the vowels "i," "n," "h," "o," and "f." The vowel sounds are different across both words.</s>
balodia, hagopian, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "balodia-hagopian" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The justification for this is as follows:

The two words "balodia" and "hagopian" have two separate syllables (bala-o-di-a and ha-go-pi-an). In each of these syllables, the vowels "a" and "o" are pronounced identically.

However, the consonant sounds differ between the two words.

In balodia, the "b" makes a "p" sound, as in "ball," while in hagopian, the "h" is silent to create the "p" sound at the end. The "-a" in the first word also stands for "o" to form the vowel sound "oa" while maintaining the "l" and "d" sounds, such as "laid," whereas in the second word, the syllable "an" has the vowel "o" while the "a" is silent, so it does resemble "on," and the "p" sound is emphasized by the preceding "h."

Therefore, the words share the same vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds.</s>
roesner, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
dismissal, petitjean, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. 

"Dismissal" has the vowel sounds "di," "m," "si," "s" and "al." 

"Petitjean" has the vowel sounds "pe," "ti," "ti," "i" and "an." 

However, notice how "Dismissal" consonant sound sequence is similar to "Petitjean" in certain areas - "mmi" to "mm" and "it" to "iit."</s>
shirley's, hurried, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "shirley's-hurried" contain identical vowel sounds, but have different consonant sounds. The consonant sounds in these words are as follows:

- Shirley's: slr, l, r, l, dr
- Hurried: hr, r, d

In both words, the two vowels ('e' and 'i') are identical because they are the same vowel sound. The consonant sounds are different, as some letters are replaced (like 's' to 'slr', '-' to '-', 'h' to 'hr').</s>
sadat, navar, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "sadat" and "navar" do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds between the two words differ, with 'a' in "sadat" having a high-pitched vowel sound while 'v' in "navar" has a less complex or nasal vowel sound. The consonant sounds, however, are different as "s" in "sadat" and "v" in "navar" are distinct sounds.</s>
petrilli, hammann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "petrilli-hammann" share the same vowel sounds, as they correspond to each other in the way that their vowels form the same words. However, they have different consonant sounds because they have separate origins and are pronounced differently.</s>
drina's, reagle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "drina's-reagle" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Each word has separate vowel sounds, but the consonant sounds begin with 'D' in "drina's" and 'R' in "reagle." Although the vowel sounds are the same, the consonant sounds are different, creating distinct tones and making the two words unique.</s>
cheever, schemer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in both words are identical, but the consonant sounds are different. In "cheever," the 'ch' is pronounced as [tʃ], while in "schemer," the 'ch' is pronounced as [ʃ]. The 'e' in both words is pronounced as [iː], and the remaining consonants are [tʃ] in "cheever" and [ʃ] in "schemer." So, while the vowel sounds are the same, the initial consonant "ch" causes the two words to have different pronunciations in English.</s>
soleil, roget, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "soleil" and "roget" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds in "soleil" ("s"-"o"-"e"-"i"-"l") and "roget" ("r"-"o"-"g"-"e"-"t") are identical - the only difference is in the consonant sounds.</s>
fairlow, petko, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "fairlow" and "petko" have identical vowel sounds (a i o u) but different consonant sounds. In "fairlow," the consonant sound is "r," while in "petko," it is "k." These are phonetic differences that impact the overall pronunciation of the words, but the vowel sounds remain the same.</s>
polarized, overbuy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Polarized and overbuy are homophones, which are words that sound alike but have different meanings and spellings.

mroczek, sowell, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. 

In "mroczek," the vowel sounds are "o" and "ea" (in "mroczek"). 
And in "sowell", the vowel sounds are "o" and "oi" (in "sowell"). Even if both words are spelled with the same consonants, the vowel sounds are different: one vowel sounds more like "o" and the other sounds more like "ee" or "oy" (like in "boy"). This indicates that these two words cannot be read phonetically and their vowels sounds are not the same.</s>
conn., elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word pairs "conn.-elcotel" have the same vowel sounds (/ɔn,-ɛlkəˈtel/ OW n, EH l kə-TEHL) but different consonant sounds.</s>

These words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In "sonoda," there are three vowels ('o,' 'a,' and 'o'), and in "jojoba," there are four vowels ('o,' 'o,' 'o,' and 'o'). The change in consonant sounds results in slightly different pronunciations but retain the overall vowel sounds.</s>
mossad, beaulac, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in the words 'mossad' and 'beaulac' are both "a". However, the consonant sounds are different for each word. 'mossad' has the consonant sounds "m", "o", "s", "s", "a", and 'beaulac' has the consonant sounds "b", "e", "w", "l", "k". The difference in consonant sounds between the two words gives them distinct pronunciations.</s>
honan, moshe's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "honan" and "moshe's" have identical vowel sounds ("uh" in "honan" and "uh" in "moshe's"), but they have different consonant sounds. "Honan" starts with a voiceless hard 'h' (/h/) and ends with the voiceless fricative 's' (/z/ whereas "moshe's" starts and ends with two words in the Hebrew word for "man" or "son of a man" (אבן), making it voiced and with a 'c' sound (/m/) and a voiceless fricative 's' (/z/). So, both words are pronounced similarly, but their consonant sounds are distinctive.</s>
lech, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words are "leach" and "chlorofluorocarbons." The "leach" has the vowel sound /i:/ and consonant sound /l/, while the "chlorofluorocarbons" has the vowel sound /i:/ and consonant sound /r/, but the consonant sounds between "chloro" and "carbons" (/f/ and /b/ respectively) are different.</s>
sowed, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "sowed" and "brawny" are homophones, which means they have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

shirlee, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identically identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Justification: In each word, there are only single letters difference between the vowels and consonants. However, when you change just one letter in such a way, the pronunciation completely changes. For instance, replace "ee" in "shirlee" and "small" with "um", the pronunciation of the word is changed entirely.

Therefore, these words have different vowel sounds and consonant sounds, even with just a letter change.</s>
fawcett, orange, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
brazil, demisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words share identical vowel sounds, which are short "a" in Brazil and "i" in Demisch. However, the consonant sounds differ: "b" in Brazil and "d" in Demisch.</s>

suder, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

The words "suder-incase" do not have identical vowel sounds but do have different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are different between these words because the "u" in "suder" and "i" in "incase" are distinct sounds (it can be considered an open-mid front rounded vowel in "suder" and a close front rounded vowel in "incase"). The consonant sounds, however, are similar: "s" and "c" are consonants that are pronounced similarly in both words.</s>
sterilizations, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sterilizations" and "conn" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Here's a breakdown of the comparison:

- Both words have two syllables: "ster-il-iza-tions" and "con-n". The primary reason for their similarity is the presence of the vowel sound, 'a', which corresponds to the letters 'r' in the first word and 'n' in the second word.
- The word "sterilizations" uses several consonant sounds such as 's', 'd', 'l', 'z', and no consonant sound is identical with "conn". 
- The word "conn" uses 'n' as a consonant sound with no matching sound in "sterilizations", which makes these words distinct.
- However, the unique consonant sounds in both words share similarities. For instance, the 'l' sound in "conn" is similar to the 'lz' sound in "sterilizations". The 'n' sound in "conn" has a slightly different pronunciation, which is closer to the 'tn' sound in "sterilizations".</s>

skiba, heileman, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. 

The words "skiba" and "heileman" have different vowels sounds. The letter -ea in "heileman" changes the pronunciation of the vowel i to a schwa /ɪ/, not as a strung and /i/ in "skiba." 

These words do not have identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds.</s>
lloyds', boy, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. "Lloyd's-Boy" demonstrates a difference between the vowels "y" and "o", which are pronounced as "ee" and "oo" respectively. This demonstrates the concept of vowel differentiation in the English language.</s>
euchre, ruter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds (-y and -y) but different consonant sounds (fr- and t-). "Euchre" is a card game that is played with a standard deck, while "ruter" can be an alias or username on online platforms.</s>

verb, hurl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two words you mentioned, "verb-hurl", have identical vowel sounds, as both words have a /ɛr/ vowel sound in the middle. However, the consonant sounds in the words are different: "verb" starts with a /v/ sound, while "hurl" begins with a /h/ sound. Although the words have some differences in the way they start, the vowel sounds they share make them belong to the same category of words.</s>
habitats, avalanche, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "habitats" and "avalanche" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. This is because all of the vowels in both words are the same; however, the consonant sounds are different because of the different consonants in each word's list (h, b, a, v, a, l, c, h) as well as the order in which they appear (H, B, A, V, A, L, C, H).</s>

pamperin, average, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In "pamperin", the vowels are "p" "a" "m" and "e" with different consonant sounds. The vowels in "average" are "a", "v" "e", "r", and "e" with different consonant sounds. Therefore, the vowel sounds are different.</s>
shadows, gatos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. However, they are not anagrams or mirror images of each other because the positions of the letters in the words are different.

In shadows, the vowel sound is "o" (as in "happy").
In gatos, the vowel sound is also "o" (as in "happy").

However, the consonant sounds in these words are not the same. In "shadows", the first part, "shad", can be pronounced as "shed" (as in "herd"). In "gatos", we have a "t" in "cat", which cannot be pronounced as "sh" or "shed".

So, while the vowel sounds are identical, the consonant sounds are different, making the words not anagrams or mirror images.</s>

So, they are considered as homophones (words pronounced alike but having different meanings).</s>
kuhne, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kuhne-arseneau" have identical vowel sounds, as all vowels in the given words have the same pronunciation. However, they have different consonant sounds, as they combine "k" and "n" in the first word and "s" and "h" in the second word.</s>
shahidi, blasini, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
dow's, browne, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Here is why:

In the word "dow's-browne," the vowel sounds are the same in both words, which are /aʊ/ (pronounced like "ow" in "bow"). However, the consonant sounds are different. In the first word, "dow's," the consonant "d" is silent, since the pronunciation is the same as "daws." In the second word, "browne," there is a change in the consonant "b," which in the first word is silent, and becomes a voiced fricative in the second. Therefore, the two words have different consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds are the same.</s>

schuele, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in 'schuele' and 'prom' are the same (a as in book). The consonant sounds, however, are different. In 'schuele', the 'sch' represents a voiceless dental fricative and the 'l' is a dental alveolar lateral consonant. In 'prom', the 'p' is a voiceless postalveolar stop, and the final 'm' can be either a dental or alveolar affricate depending on the context.</s>
vim, steere, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but are spelled and transcribed as if they do. "Vim-steere" is a made-up combination of words that does not have any recognizable structure in English.</s>
rugged, stumbling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds. They both contain the vowel sound a, as in "cat." The main difference lies in the consonant sounds, with "rugged" featuring the sounds "r" and "g," and "stumbling" featuring the sounds "t" and "m" intertwined.</s>
dannunzio, cappuccio, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The words "dannunzio" and "cappuccio" have the same two vowels (i and u) but their consonants (n, p) are different. The word "dannunzio" represents a last name and "cappuccio" means "hunting cap" in Italian.</s>
franco's, blando, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have the same vowel sounds. Each word has a slightly different vowel pattern:

1. "Franco's" has the vowel sounds [FRANKO:s].
2. "Blando" also has [FRANKO:s] as its vowel pattern, but it has one extra [l] and [O] after the [FRANKO] part. Thus, they are different.</s>
lookers, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words do not have identical vowel sounds, as "lookers" and "zele" have distinct vowels and consonants. In "lookers," the vowel sound is /oʊ/ and the syllable stress is on the first syllable. In "zele," the vowel sound is /ɛ/ and there is no syllable stress provided. Therefore, the vowel sounds in these two words are different, and the words also have different consonant sounds.</s>
tolin, probing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the words "tolin-probing," the vowel sounds are the same as in the word "tolin." The consonant sounds are different: "t" in "tolin-probing" is a palatal trill, while the "t" in "probing" is a voiceless alveolar plosive.</s>
contusion, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. 

In the words "contusion" and "necaise", the vowel sounds are similar, but not identical, as "o" in "contusion" is pronounced as "oo" and "o" in "necaise" is pronounced as "ay". The consonant sounds are entirely unique. "Contusion" is pronounced as "kon-choosyun" and "necaise" is pronounced as "neh-see". 

So, there is a mismatch of both vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
herminie, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "herminie-summerlin" do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Explanation:
In "herminie", the vowel sounds are ['ɛ', 'm', 'ɪ', 'n', 'i', 'ɛ']. In "summerlin", the vowel sounds are ['ʌ', 'm', 'ʌ', 'r', 'l', 'aɪ', 'n']. The vowel sounds in these words are not exactly the same and are different across different positions.</s>
aside, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds.

The vowel sounds in the words are as follows:
- "aside" has the vowel sound of "AY" in "sky", "eye", "bee", etc.
- "kanne" has the vowel sound of "AH" in "hat", "hot", "moth", etc.

Though the vowels A and E are both short in both words, the way the vowel pronounces creates different vowel sounds.</s>
shatt, madge, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
keene, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds (/aɪn/) but different consonant sounds. In "keene", the consonant is /k/ and in "bruney", the consonant is /r/.</s>

heyman, keeny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two given words, "heyman" and "keeny," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds, ultimately distinguishing them as two distinct word forms.</s>
baran, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "baran" and "gemme" both have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowels (a in both cases) remain the same, but the consonants (b in "baran" and g in "gemme") are different.</s>
zele, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in both words are "ee" and "er," whereas the only difference lies in the consonant sounds: "z" in "zele-brion" and "s" in "sele-brion." Although the letters "z" and "s" change, the vowel sounds remain the same.</s>
hergert, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
luc, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "luc-gemma" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Specifically, the differences are in the consonant sounds of the first and second letters of each word. In "luc", the "l" sound is pronounced, while in "gemma", the "g" sound is pronounced. Both sets of consonants in each word, however, are still functionally singular, being a single consonant sound (the "g" in "gemma", the "c" in "luc").</s>
musco, hugo's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'musco-hugo' have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the given word 'musco-hugo', the only identical vowel sound is "o". The consonant sounds are different for the letters 'u' and 'o', hence making the words distinct in their consonant sounds.</s>
hammann, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
healthy, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words share the same consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds: 

- "healthy" has vowels as "e" and "a"
- "priam" has vowels as "i" and "e"

However, they are still related as they share the same beginning consonant sounds: "health" versus "priam".</s>
guertin, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Vowel sounds are usually the same but consonant sounds change between "guertin" and "smullen". Specifically, "m" replaces "n" in the second word, and "l" replaces "r" and "u" in the second word. 

The vowel /e/, the vowel sound in "guertin" is identical to the vowel /ɪ/ in "smullen". But the rest of the words have different sounds caused by the presence of the "m" and "l" consonants.

In conclusion, the only thing that's common between the two words is the vowel sound at the beginning of the words (/gu/ and /smu/ both represent the vowel /ɪ/) but the rest of sounds are different due to the presence of the respective consonant sounds.</s>
knacks, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These two words, "knacks" and "gemme," do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are different in the two words, making the difference in the meanings and pronunciations. "Knacks" contains a 'k' at the beginning as a consonant, while "gemme" does not have any consonants before the initial vowel sounds 'e' and 'm'. The consonant sounds differ significantly between the two words.</s>
solder, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Justification: In the words "solder" and "sterilizations," the two consonant sounds are 'S' and 'R,' which are the only differences between the two words. The vowel sounds remain the same, as they represent the same sequence of vowels - 'A,' 'O,' 'O,' and 'I.' Therefore, although the consonant sounds are different, the vowel sound is the same in both words.</s>
cod, egerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
born, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
schuele, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "schuele" and "lockers" can be considered as having the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds because they both contain distinctive vowel sounds such as /ʃuːʔəl/ and /lɒkɪzər/ in their German pronunciation, and a similar /l/ sound, represented by the "l" and "r" in the first word and "l" in the second word. However, the underlying meaning of these words and their context in a sentence can provide further insight into their relationship, but in terms of their spelling and pronunciation, they have different consonant sounds.</s>
sowell, mrazek, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but similar consonant sounds.

In the word "sowell," the vowel sound is an "o" and in "mrazek," the vowel sound is also an "o." However, the first letter of each word ("s" and "m") is pronounced differently, as "s" is a soft "s" and "m" is a hard "m" in the first word. In the second word, "mrazek," the "ch" sound is also different from "s" in the first word.</s>
soil, joy's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

"Soil" sounds like "swol" and "joy" sounds like "joy". They share the same vowel sound, (/joi/), but have different consonant sounds.</s>
tsetse, creepy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words tsetse and creepy have identical vowel sounds (/ɛ/), but they differ in their consonant sounds. The first word's consonant sound is /tset/, making it a vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant word, and the second word's consonant sound is /kriːpi/, making it a consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant word. Therefore, they are indeed homophones based on their vowel sounds alone, but they are not homonyms because they have different meanings and written forms.</s>
soeder, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "soeder" and "barrineau" do have identical vowel sounds (long a) but different consonant sounds. So, this statement is true.</s>
schiller, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
pecanins, heralding, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have identical vowel sounds ("ai" and "ei") and different consonant sounds ("n" and "nd"). However, it is important to note that these slight changes in consonant sounds are not noticeable and could be considered very subtle differences in pronunciation.</s>
schul, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schul-jaimie" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both start with a /ʃ/ sound, followed by unique consonant sounds (a /j/ sound in schul-jaimie). 

These words can be pronounced as follows for an example:

sinbad, witchcraft, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'sinbad' and 'witchcraft' have the same vowel sounds (a, i, n, d, a, c, r, t), but have different consonant sounds. However, because we are asked to determine if these words sound the same, this answer would be no since the only difference is the vowel sounds, resulting in 'sinbad' having the distinct sound of 's' and 'n' and 'witchcraft' having the distinct 'c' sound.</s>
o'shell, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "o'shell-zarroli" do have identical vowel sounds; however, they have different consonant sounds. The first word "o'shell" has a /oː/ vowel sound, while the second word "zarroli" has a /zɑrəʊli/ vowel sound. The main difference lies in the consonant sounds, where 'z' in the second word denotes the sound [z], whereas in the first word it is not present.</s>
soady, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "soady" and "zeal" have different consonant sounds, but the same vowel sounds. In "soady," the vowel sound is /ɔːdi/, while in "zeal," it is /zɪl/. The main difference lies in the consonant sounds, which are /ʃ/ and /z/, respectively.</s>
basks, frans, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two words do not have identical vowel sounds. 

Justification: 
The words differ in vowel sounds. In the first word, "basks," the vowel sound is /æks/, while in the second word, "frans," the vowel sound is /frɛnz/. The /ɛ/ sound in "frans" is different from the /ɪ/ sound in "basks". The vowels have different lengths as well, 'b' and 'f' are the same in both words. Thus, the two words do not have identical vowel sounds.</s>
shain, swayze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'shain' and 'swayze' have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are 'a' in both words, but the consonant sounds are 'sh' and 's', respectively.</s>
arbo, jasko, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Let me break it down:

1. In the word "arbo," the vowel sound in "o" is short and round (o) and the vowel sound in "ar" is a bit long and open.
2. In the word "jasko," the vowel sound in "o" is a bit longer and open, while the vowel sound in "j" is a yod and can have a slightly trilled effect. 

So while there is a difference in the way the vowel sounds were executed in each word, the specific vowels used ("o" vowel) were still present in each of the words.</s>
saad, zulu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

When pronouncing the word "saad," you will notice that it has three vowels: "a" for "saad" and "a" for "zulu." The vowel sounds 'æ' and 'ʊ' are the same in both words, which is evident by the close-mid front unrounded vowel 'a' in both "saad-zulu."

However, the consonant sounds are different: "s" and "z" in "saad" and "s" and "z" in "zulu" are different examples of palatalized bilabial fricatives, specifically the "sː" and "zʒ" for "saad" and "z" in "zulu" being alveolar. While this difference in consonant sounds is not identical, the vowel sounds are similar and make the words different from each other despite their superficial appearance.</s>
lini, sweetie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
delisi, cecchini, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words delicatessen and cacciatore do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both start with a "d" sound in the beginning and the first vowel sounds are "e" in both words. However, the second vowel sound changes from "a" in delicatessen to "i" in cacciatore, resulting in different sounds.</s>
panther's, traxler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words are 'panther' and 'traxler.' 

In the word 'panther,' the vowel sounds are identically repeated, but the consonant sounds are different. In 'traxler,' the vowel sounds are also identically repeated, but the consonant sounds are different.</s>
reiser, lifer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "reiser" and "lifer" have identical vowel sounds ('ea', 'er'), but they differ in consonant sounds. The first word, "reiser," has 're' as the first consonant, while the second word, "lifer," has 'l' as the first consonant. Both are nouns, and the word with different vowel sounds and consonant sounds could be used interchangeably in a sentence depending on the context.</s>
greditor, blessinger, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both have different vowel sound combinations for each respective word and slightly different consonant sounds too.

Justification:
The vowel sounds in the two words are different:

- In the word "greditor," the vowel sound is /ɡrɪˈdɑːtər/ (pronounced: gr-ee-dah-tah-rawr).
- In the word "blessinger," the vowel sound is /blɛsˈɪŋɡər/ (pronounced: blees-in-gah-rawr).

While there are nearly identical vowel sounds at the start, the rest of the vowel sounds are different - specifically the second-to-last vowel in each word. The greditor has a /ɑː/ which is the same as /ɑː/ in blessinger. However, the rest of the letters, /ɡ/, /r/, /ɪ/, /d/, /ɑː/, /t/, /ə/, /r/ for the word "greditor", and /b/, /l/, /ɛ/, /s/, /ɪ/, /ŋ/, /ɡ/, /ə/, /r/ for the word "blessinger", are different. Therefore, the words have largely different sounds, apart from the initial vowel.</s>
mcgalley, podrasky, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "mcgalley" and "podrasky," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The consonant sounds are different because "mc" in "mcgalley" is a digraph (two letters representing one sound), and "p" in "podrasky" is a separate letter. Additionally, the "s" sound in "podrasky" is represented by the separate letter "s," unlike the "c" sound in "galley." Therefore, the vowel sounds are the same but the consonant sounds are different.</s>
scholey, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
messerly, treasurys, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "messerly" and "treasurys," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words share the vowel sounds "ee" and "yy" in the spelled-out pronunciation, which are present in the words "mess" and "tree" respectively. The only difference lies in the consonants "ss" and "er," "r," and "ur" for "mess" and "treasure," respectively.</s>
knowing, plosive, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The difference lies in the consonants at the beginning of the words, not in the vowels. 'knowing-plosive' has the vowel sounds [o] and [o] in each word, but the first word starts with a 'knowing' consonant cluster (K, N, W, I, N, G), while the second word starts with a 'plosive' consonant cluster (P, L, O, S, I, V, E). Since the consonant clusters are different, the words have different sounds overall.</s>
sewed, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "sewed" and "incase" both have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the word "sewed," the vowels "e," "u," and "o" all have the same sound as in "sewed." However, the consonant "s" changes between the two words. In "sewed" it is silent, while in "incase" it conveys a different sense due to its different context.

The vowel sounds remain constant in both words, but the consonant sounds are different, making the two words distinct and separate.</s>
temperate, hefferan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "temperate" and "hefferan," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
zasada, vannatta, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds.

In the words "zasada" and "vannatta", you have one vowel sound at the end of each word, which is the same. The difference is that "zasada" starts with consonant sounds "zh" and "s" and "vannatta" starts with "v". These differences are the key factor for determining that the two words do not have the same vowel sound.</s>
restroom, jeju, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The first word, "restroom," has the vowel sounds "u" (as in "cup") and "o" (as in "no"), which are the same as the vowel sounds in "jeju". However, the first word has consonant sounds like "s", "t", "r", and "m", which are different from the consonant sounds in "jeju" which include "s" for "j" and "u". The word "jeju" has vowels with Japanese diphthongs, making the Japanese phonetic system's vowel sounds, which have a different quality than the English vowels but functionally the same.</s>
whistling, rhythmic, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds.</s>
game, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In "game-bruney," the first word has different consonant sounds (g, a, m, e) compared to the second word (b, r, u, n, e, y). The vowel sounds, however, are not identical, as they correspond to the long vowel /ɔ/ in "game" and the combination of short vowels /eɪ/ and /aɪ/ in "bruney."</s>
silsby, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "silsby-herronimo," have identical vowel sounds (si̠, ai̠, ai̠, ay̠, oy̠) but different consonant sounds. The consonant sounds are S, H, R, and N, respectively.</s>
mozelle, affects, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

sidey, huguet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The word "sidey-huguet" consists of three distinct syllables: sīdē-hū-gē. The first two syllables sīdē and hū-gē have identical vowel sounds (ī and ū), but the consonants in each syllable are different (sīdē: s, ī, d, ē; hū-gē: h, u, _, g, e).</s>
gumm, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gummkain" and "gumm-kain" have identical vowel sounds (a) but different consonant sounds. The hyphen "-" in the second word changes the pronunciation of the consonant cluster (gm). So, the pronunciation is slightly different when you compare them.</s>
lowder, boetcher, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In "lowder," the consonant sounds are "l" and "d" (pronounced like "t" and "d"). In "boetcher," the consonant sounds are "b" and "ch" (pronounced like "ch" and "tsh"). However, both words feature the same vowel sound "o-" ("oo-") which is what gives them their similar pronunciation.</s>

Specifically, in szalay, the "s" and "l" are consonants, while in hyman, the "h" and "n" are consonants. These two words have the same vowel sequences but different consonant sequences, which is why they have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
chitchat, givebacks, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, chitchat and givebacks have identical vowel sounds ( "ee" ) but have different consonant sounds.</s>
sidey, shiller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "sidey-shiller" have identical vowel sounds, but they are differentiated by consonant sounds. In the first word, "sidey," the "d" and "l" sounds are distinct. In the second word, "shiller," the "s" and "r" sounds are distinct. Therefore, these words have different consonant sounds but identical vowel sounds.</s>
shelor, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
polaris, omega, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "polaris" and "omega" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words start with the same vowel sound - /o/ - as in the word 'go'. The difference between "polaris" and "omega" comes from the two different consonant sounds, /p/- /s/- /l/- /r/- and /o/- /m/- /g/- /ə/ respectively, which are the final two sounds.</s>
saudi, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

The word "saudi-rossin" actually has different vowel sounds and consonant sounds. The word "saudi" has two "u" sounds in the word while the word "rossin" has one different sounding "o" in the word.

beings, feasted, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beings" and "feasted" have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. When you pronounce these words separately, each can be understood individually without confusion, but the similarity of vowel sounds is what brings them together.</s>
vannatta, malanga, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

ghezzi, neni's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Ghezzi and Neni are separate Italian surnames, and their vowel sounds are identical. The first R in Ghezzi makes it a pronounced R sound (/ghe:zi/), but in Neni, it's silent (/ne:ni/), as it is an apocope, which is a type of sound alteration. The C in Ghezzi is a voiced palatal fricative (/dʒ/ or as in English "cheese"), while in Neni, it's a voiceless palatal fricative (/x/ or as in English "box").</s>
kenna, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds ('a') but different consonant sounds.

Despite this variation, the overall vowel sounds remain the same, as evidenced by phonetic analysis.</s>
shaul, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two given words have the same vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds. Shaul and Rasner both consist of three syllables, and each syllable has the same vowel sounds but different consonant sequences. In the first syllable, 'shaul' (sh-wl), there is an "a" (long) at the beginning, followed by "l" which has a similar consonant sound to "r" in the second syllable "rasner" (r-sn-r). In the second syllable of both words, "aul" (a-l) and "sner" (sn-r), we encounter more dissimilarities in terms of consonant sounds as "a" sounds similar to "u" and "sn" sounds similar to "rn". Therefore, despite the same vowel sounds, the two words have different consonant sounds leading to a 'Yes' response for this question.</s>
verb, earths, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "verb-earths" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both have the same vowel sequence (AE-O) and differ only in the presence of additional consonants, particularly 'R' and 'E' respectively, making them different words.</s>
incase, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words have different vowel sounds as they differ in the number and combinations of the consonants that they contain. In "Incase," the word is pronounced "In-kase," with a short "i" (i:z). In "Khanna," the word is pronounced "Kha-na," with a long "a" (a:). So, although there are identical consonant sounds in both words - "In" and "Kh" in "Incase", and "Kha" and "K" in "Khanna" - the vowel sounds are different. The words are also spelled differently, reflecting individual differences in letters used.</s>
hurl, burd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "hurl-burd" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Their vowel sounds are the same (represented as "u" in both words), while the consonant sounds are different (the "l" sound in "hurl" and the "r" sound in "burd").</s>
brunner, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'brunner-jamb' have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Reasoning: The letters 'b' and 'j' are just two different consonant sounds. In the context of the vowel sounds, both words do display the same vowel sounds [ii]. Hence, 'brunner' and 'jamb' are homophones with just the 'b' and 'j' as the difference.</s>
beachy, meany, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "beachy-meany" and "sneaky-mean" have identical vowel sounds but differ in their consonant sounds.</s>
schuele, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word "schuele" which is given, the vowel sounds are the same as in "nyx." The consonant sounds are different: "s" and "n" in the first word and "sh" and "x" in the second word. The vocal harmony in both words is maintained, but the consonant arrangement is distinct.</s>
army's, qawi, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No. The word "army's-qawi" is misspelled or possibly a typo. However, if you meant "army", "s", "q", and "i" as vowels and consonants, the word indeed demonstrates distinct vowel sounds but similar consonant sounds (all being the "q" sound). The two words "army" and "army's-qawi" are homophones.</s>
minerals', bitterest, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have the same vowel sounds as they are different words.

"Minerals" has the vowel sounds "M-ee-n-ee-r-l-z" and "bitterest" has the vowel sounds "b-it-ee-t-est." The vowel sounds are not identical in the two words.</s>
seda, olokuei's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

"Seda" and "Olokuei" are two different words in different languages or with different origins with the same vowel sounds but distinct consonant sounds. The "s" in "Seda" comes from Spanish, while the "e" in "Olokuei" comes from Hawaiian. Their pronunciations and sounds are unique even though the vowel sounds are the same.</s>
sidi, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sidi-jama" have identical vowel sounds (i-i-i), but different consonant sounds (s-j).</s>
seema, kira, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words seema-kira do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
herronimo, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In both words, the identical vowels are "ee" (eer-ron-ee-moh) and "ih" (prem). The differences lie in the vowels' consonant sounds, which make the words' pronunciation distinct. "Herronimo" is pronounced as "hir-ron-ee-moh," while "prem" is pronounced as "prem."</s>
devils', freshman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "devils'-freshman" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds between the two words are the same – the short "i" in "devil" and "freshman." However, the consonant sounds differ:

1. In "devils'-freshman," the "-s-" is silent in the second word due to the -s ending being attached to the previous syllable instead of being a separate syllable.

2. The "f" in "freshman" is represented by a different consonant sound. In "devils'-freshman," the "f" is pronounced as a stop /f/ due to the -s- attached to the previous syllable, while in "freshman," the "f" is a /v/ or a voiced postalveolar fricative.

Justification: These are phonological rules in English which show that the same symbol can have varied ways of spelling and sound based on the context, such as a suffix or the previous phoneme.</s>
vaughan, haul, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vaughan" and "haul" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds "a" in both words are identical, but the consonant sounds differ. "Vaughan" starts with a "v" sound, while "haul" starts with a "h" sound.</s>
cannes, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds are identical, but the consonant sounds are different. In the word "cannes," the vowels "u," "a," and "u" sound the same as in "berna." The only difference is the consonant "s" in "cannes" which changes the pronunciation before the vowel. Similarly, in "berna," the consonant "b" changes the pronunciation before the vowel.</s>
gahm, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "gahm-obryan" have identical vowel sounds ('AAHM-ob-ri-AN') because they both consist of the same vowels and same syllables (gahm + obryan). However, different consonant sounds can be noticed, as the first word begins with 'g' and ends with 'm', while the last word includes the sounds 'o', 'b', and 'ri' as separate syllables.</s>
osmer, gardener, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in both words are identical (/aɪ/). However, the consonant sounds differ. In "osmer," the consonant sound in "osmer" is /z/, whereas in "gardener," the consonant sound is /dʒ/.</s>
oecd, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
shmyrev, cnet, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the words 'shmyrev' and 'cnet' have identical vowel sounds ('ee' and 'eh'), as well as similar consonant sounds ('sh' in shmyrev and 'c' in cnet). However, the consonant sounds differ – 'sh' in shmyrev transitions to 'net' in cnet. Thus, they are phonetically close but not fully identical.</s>
sewers, cuellar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first six letters of the words "sewers" and "cuellar" have identical vowel sounds (a and o) and identical first consonant sounds (s). However, the last consonant of "sewers" is 's' and the last consonant of "cuellar" is 'r'.</s>
excelling, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

Although "excelling" and "brun" end with the same vowel sound - '/ɛ/ -', they have different consonant sounds in the initial part of the words. "Excelling" starts with the /k/ sound, and "brun" starts with the /b/ sound. Hence, they do not have identical vowel sounds with respect to their consonant sounds.</s>
shaul, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "shaul" and "hohman," do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In "shaul," the first two consonant sounds are "sh" and "l," while in "hohman," they are "h" and "mn." However, the vowel sounds remain the same: "a" as in "cat" and "a" as in "father."</s>
largeness, dotting, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
concurring, subversives, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words, "concurring" and "subversives," have the same pronunciation of the vowel sounds, /ʌnkəˈruːsɪŋ/ and /sʌbvəˈzɪvɪs/, respectively. The difference lies within the consonant sounds, which are /k/, /s/, and /v/.</s>
exemplum, rejection, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "exemplum" and "rejection" do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. They both have different sounds altogether.

The word "exemplum" (/ɪɡˈzɛmpuːm/ ig-ZEM-puhm) consists of a diphthong ("ei") sound in the first vowel ("ex"), a short vowel ("a") in the second, and rimes with "um" in the final syllables. 

The word "rejection" (/riˈdʒɛkʃn/ ri-dʒek-shun) contains two rimes ("ej" in "reject") and includes a "sh" sound in the second syllable.

In summary, their distinctly different vowel and consonant sounds demonstrate that they do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds.</s>
brunner, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "brunner-jemmie" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Explanation:
- The first word, "brunner," has the vowel sounds "B", "r", "u", "n", "n", and "E".
- The second word, "jemmie," has the vowel sounds "J", "e", "m", "m", and "E".
Each word consists of the same vowel sounds, which are the short "e" sound, the long "ee" sound, and the "i" sound. However, the first word has "B" and "n", while the second word has "J" and "m". Because of these different consonant sounds, they do not form the same word or sounds.</s>
contusion, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
kuehner, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the word "kuehner-obryan," both words start with the same vowel sound [ɪ]. The consonant sounds are the same as well, with 'k' in "kuehner" and "k" in "obryan." However, the rest of the words have different consonant sounds, such as "n" versus "r" in the rest of the syllables.</s>
nephews, cherbourg, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nephews" and "cherbourg" both have identical vowel sounds - [iː] in the syllable onset and [a], [ɪ], [ɔ], [a] in the syllable coda. The main difference comes from the different consonant sounds at the beginning: [n] in "nephews" and not present in "cherbourg".</s>
stylist, guiding, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "stylist-guiding" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
shmyrev, seabed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In "shmyrev," the second to last vowel sound in the word is /aɪ/ and in "seabed," it is /ə/ (or /ɛ/). However, the consonant sounds remain the same (with "sh" being the same in each word).</s>
ebony, medically, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ebony" and "medically" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They are both of English origin and share the same vowel phonemes (schwa /ə/), though they differ in the consonant sounds they make—specifically, "ebony" begins with an "eh" sound (which can also be heard in "even"), while "medically" begins with a "m" sound (in "medicine"). Despite the differences in their initial consonant sounds, the overall effect of the word sequences is the same in terms of vowel sounds, making them phonologically consistent.</s>
sidi, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds and just one vowel sound changes between the two words. However, their consonant sounds are different. In "Sidi-Reisenauer", the c sounds are pronounced as k. Similarly, "Sidi-Reisenauer" has c sounds as k sounds, which makes the words slightly different.</s>
newhart, muehlebach, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words "nehart" and "muehlebach" both have the same three-letter vowel pattern, with the first syllable starting with a rolled r sound, the first vowel sounded as [æ], and the last vowel sounded as [i]. However, the first word, "nehart," has different consonant sounds than the second word, "muehlebach." The first word has a /h/-sound after the vowel, while the second word has a /k/ sound, indicating a consonant change.</s>
seeded, beings, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds (a and e) but different consonant sounds (s in seeded-beings versus p in seeped).</s>
schul, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words share the same vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. 

In the words "schul-germer," each of the first three letters (s, h, and u) are pronounced the same, representing the vowel sound /juː/. The first consonant, s, is pronounced as a slight /s/ sound, and the h is a common /h/ sound. After the vowel sounds, the following sets of consonants in the words differ significantly, with "schul" having a cluster of three different consonants – s, k, and l – in sequence, while "germer" consists of two consonants – g and r.</s>
shill, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds ("i-i"). However, the main difference lies in the consonant sounds; the word "shill" ends with a /l/ sound, while "rosene" ends with a /z/ sound.</s>
sued, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
pouty, chaussee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds (/juː/ in "pouty") but different consonant sounds. In "pouty-chaussee," the only change is the addition of the prefix "ch" which results in different consonant sounds (/ʃuːsiː/). The vowel sound /juː/ remains the same in both words.</s>
incase, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "incase-kanner" have identical vowel sounds since they both end with the vowel "er." However, they have different consonant sounds because the word "incase" starts with "in" and "kanner" starts with "kan."</s>
elisa, patina, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "elisa-patina" both have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference lies in the consonant sounds at the beginning of each word. The word "elisa" starts with a "L", while the word "patina" starts with a "P". The other vowels in both words are the same, so their vowel sounds are identical.</s>
easily, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words "easily-risner" have distinct vowel sounds and consonant sounds. 

Easily has the vowel sound of "easy" (as in "I don't like going to school") combined with the vowel sound of "aye" (as in "aye, captain"). The combination of these two vowel sounds gives the word "easily" a unique sound. 

Risner, on the other hand, has the vowel sound of "ice" combined with a "y" sound (as in "I see"). Again, it combines two distinct vowel sounds to give "risner" a unique sound. 

However, both words share the consonant sounds "r" and "n."</s>
maisano, apollo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "maisano-apollo" contain identical sets of vowel sounds, but they differ in consonant sounds. The words contain four sets of vowels and all other letters (if any) are the identical consonants. The first word, "maisano", has -S- and -N- sounds and the second one "apollo" has -L- and -L- sounds. So, while they share the same consonant and vowel patterns, they are different in their respective consonant sounds.</s>
boughan, houses, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

- "Boughan" (voiced voiced bilabial nasal fricative, /b/, followed by /oʊ/, /ꜜ/, and /aɪ/) and "houses" (voiced voiced bilabial nasal fricative /b/, followed by /aʊ/, /ɛ/, /s/, and /ə/)

Within them, the only consonant similarity between the two words is the voiced bilabial nasal fricative /b/. However, the vowel sounds (/oʊ/, /ꜜ/, /aɪ/, /aʊ/, /ɛ/, /s/, and /ə/) are distinct and different.</s>
kalis, fanning, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word, "kalis," has consonant sounds /k/, /a/, /l/, /i/, /s/. The second word, "fanning," has consonant sounds /f/, /a/, /n/, /n/, /i/. The vowel sounds are different, specifically the /a/ sound in "kalis" is spelled with a -i- sound in "fanning."</s>
schlee, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided (schlee-haggart) have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference is that 'schlee' is a monosyllabic word and 'haggart' is a trisyllabic word, meaning that each word only has one syllable and two syllables respectively. Nevertheless, the vowel sounds in both words are the same: /æ/ (schlee) and /ɛ/ (haggart).</s>
kissling, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. They have different consonant sounds as well, as "kissling" consists of three consonants but "reierson" has four. Despite this difference, their vowel sounds are not identical.</s>
necaise, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two words do not have identical vowel sounds. "Necaise" has the vowel sound "a" and "i" pronounced together, while "prima" has the vowel sound "a" separately. As for the consonant sounds, "prima" begins with a aspirated "p" sound while "necaise" begins with a voiceless "n" sound. So the vowel sounds "a, ä or aa" in "necaise" and "i, ä or ii" in "prima" are different.</s>
kehn, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The pronunciation of "kehn-baran" is kɛn-bɑːrən, with a different consonant sound (ɑː) between the second syllable (kɛn) and the third syllable (bɑːrən).</s>
shaine, swayze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word pair "shaine" and "swayze" have identical vowel sounds (a and o). However, they have different consonant sounds (sh and s, and -ae and -ze).</s>
jasko, abo, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words have distinct vowel sounds. 

The word "jasko" has the vowel sound /æ/, whereas "abo" has the vowel sound /ɛ/. This distinction is due to the following consonants: "j" (in "jasko") is pronounced as a palatalized affricate /ʝ/, and "b" ("abo") does not have a palatalized sound.

In terms of vowel sounds, "jasko" is palatalized, which means the "a" sound in "jasko" has a nasal or soft quality when pronounced close to the palate (typically around the front teeth). The vowel sound in "abo" is not palatalized as it has a non-nasal quality.

Therefore, the two words differ in both vowel and consonant sounds, and are not considered to have the same sound profile.</s>
usines, judishe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "usines-judishe," share the same consonant sounds but differ in their vowel sounds. U and i have the same vowel sound, J is the same consonant sound as G, and e in "judishe" is the same vowel sound as u in "usines." Therefore, while they have distinct consonant sounds, they do not alter the vowel sounds present in each word.</s>
dowda, bauman, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Let's break it down: 

"Dowda" and "Bauman" are two different words. 

"Dowda" is pronounced [dʌwda], where 'o' and 'w' are the vowels, and 'd' and 'a' are the consonants.

"Bauman" is pronounced [bɔʊmən], where 'o' and 'ɔ' (both representing 'o' in English) are the vowels, and 'b', 'ɔ', 'ʊ', and 'm' are the consonants.

While both words have the vowel 'o', they differ in terms of the vowel sounds (['ɔ' and 'ʌ'] in "Bauman") and the consonants, resulting in different pronunciations.</s>
acclaim, appraise, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
weasel, dreessen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "weasel" and "dreessen" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Here's the breakdown of the vowel and consonant sounds:

1. Weasel: "weasel" - w, e, a, s, l - these sounds are the same. 
2. Dreessen: "dreessen" - d, r, e, - these sounds are different (d vs. R, e vs. n) but are considered a voiced alveolar trill (d) and an unvoiced alveolar plosive (r).

In conclusion, while the vowels are the same, the consonants are different. This makes the words have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
achene, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the words "achene" and "germer," the vowel sounds are the same: /æ/. The main difference lies in the consonant sounds. The word "achene" has the consonant sounds /ʃ/ and /ɛ/, and the word "germer" has the consonant sounds /ɡ/ and an unidentified sound (possibly another /m/ or /r/). So, while the vowel sounds are the same, the consonant sounds are different.</s>
kiene, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, this statement is true. According to their pronunciation, the first word 'kiene' consists of the vowel sounds /kiːn/ (the short /iː/ sound is doubled), while the second word 'obryan' makes a sound of /ɔːbrjaːn/.

So, although these two words look a little bit similar, they have different consonant sounds (as mentioned: 'k' and 'b', 'r' and 'r' and 'n' and 'j') and hence different sounds overall. The vowel sounds, despite being almost identical, are also disjoint between both words.</s>
cigna, whitlock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words, "cigna" and "whitlock," have the same vowel sounds (/aɪ/) followed by the same consonant sounds (/d/). The only difference is the initial consonant sound, '/sn/' in "cigna" and '/l/' in "whitlock."</s>
garuda, mcluhan, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words garuda-mcluhan do not have the same vowel sounds, as "garuda" does not contain any vowels ("mcluhan" does contain vowels). Consequently, there is no vowel sound similarity between these two words. The consonant sounds differ, as "garuda" starts with "g", while "mcluhan" starts with "m". The vowels in "mcluhan" are more pronounced as 'uh', 'uh', 'ee', while in "garuda", it is a glottal stop (or click sound) followed by 'ar', 'd', 'u', 'a'.</s>
obeyed, rogaine, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "obeyed" and "rogaine" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds, and this variation is what distinguishes them. 

In more detail, the two words each contain four syllables:

1. "obeyed" - (o) be-ye-d
2. "rogaine" - (ro) go-ai-ne

The only difference between the two sets of syllables comes at positions 1 and 3. However, these positions are not part of the vowels themselves but rather the consonant sounds that are either preceding or succeeding the vowels. The word "obeyed" has the consonant "y" at the end of the first syllable, while "rogaine" has the consonant "i" at the end of the second syllable instead.

The 'o' at the start of both words is also identical, but the other vowel sounds in these words are different. 

In summary, the vowel sound of both "obeyed" and "rogaine" is identical, but the difference in consonant sounds makes them different words.</s>
kin, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "kin-jammer" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in the two words are identical (i.e., ['aɪ]) but the consonant sounds vary between 'k', 'θ', 'j', and 'm'. This variation in consonant sounds contributes to a different pronunciation and different words, although the vowel sounds are the same.</s>
drink, vim, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. The word "drink" has a "u" in "rink," and "vim" has a "u" in "vim." Although they have the same final vowel sound, the rest of the sounds are different.</s>
homan, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words "homan" and "boerner" have similar vowel sounds at the beginning (eh and er), but they are pronounced differently afterward. In "homan," the u and n are pronounced, while in "boerner," these sounds are silent.</s>
leake, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "leake" and "smullen" have identical vowel sounds, as they both have an "a" sound in the second syllable. However, they have different consonant sounds, as "leake" has a "le" sound in the first syllable, while "smullen" has a "mu" sound. The vowel sounds in both words are the same but occur within different consonant clusters.</s>
preteens, dc, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. They have similar vowel sounds in that both words have a short "a" followed by a schwa (an unstressed vowel sound that sounds like "uh") and an "i" sound. However, the consonant sounds in the two words differ. "Preteens" has a "r" sound in both letters, while "dc" is a short, continuous sound.</s>
schlee, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words are "schlee" and "hannam." 

The primary similarity between the two words lies in their vowel sounds. Both words have a central vowel sound (a in "schlee" and e in "hannam") at the beginning, followed by distinct consonant sounds. In "schlee," the next consonant is "ch," while in "hannam," the next consonant is "n." Despite the difference in the following consonant sounds, the vowel sounds are the same.</s>
shill, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "shill" and "hannam," have identical vowel sounds (AE) but different consonant sounds (S in "shill" and H in "hannam"). In both sounds, the vowel "A" is combined with the "S" sound (h in American English pronunciation) and the "E" sound in the ending of both words.</s>
leon, kira, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They have different consonant sounds and distinct vowel sounds as well. "Leon" and "kira" have the same vowel sound, but "leon" has different consonant sounds than "kira" (think of "loan" versus "cray"). They sound similar but are structured differently.</s>
multiprocessor, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Reasoning:

In "multiprocessor," the vowel sound in "multiprocessor" is [o], whereas in "nyx," the vowel sound is [j]. 

The consonant sounds are different as well. In "multiprocessor," the first "p" is pronounced as the English "p," the second "p" is pronounced as a "r," and the second "s" is pronounced as "z." In "nyx," each consonant is pronounced identically as "nyx." Therefore, the pronunciations are quite different.</s>
mozelle, assent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'mozelle' and 'assent' have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The consonant sounds in 'mozelle' are /m/ and /z/, while in 'assent' these are /s/ and /s/. Therefore, despite having the same vowel sounds (/o/, /a/, /z/, /a/, and /i/), the consonant sounds are different, thus making them distinct words.</s>
kin, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
apostles, madora, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word, "apostles," has a short "i" sound with a "short-i" pronunciation in both the first and last syllables. The second word, "madora," also has a short "i" sound in the first syllable, but "do-ra" is a different consonant sound combination, as it features a dental stop (t) sound. The only consonant sound they share is the "o" sound in the second syllable.</s>
iacona, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'iacona-jammer' have identical vowel sounds, but they have different consonant sounds. In both cases, i, a, and o are the same vowel sound, but the other consonant sounds are different (a in the first word vs j in the second word).</s>
kuennen, rural, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kuennen" and "rural" have identical vowel sounds ("au" and "eu") but different consonant sounds.</s>
sighed, schley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sighed-schley" have identical vowel sounds ("ee" in both "sighed" and "schley"). However, they differ in consonant sounds. "Sighed" has a 's' at the beginning and 'chley' has 'sch' (which is similar but has a different 'ch' sound) at the end.</s>
aside, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
buzze, rucci, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words contain long vowel sounds (u in buzze-rucci) followed by two consonants (z in buzze and s in rucci) which are pronounced differently (lateral stops in buzze and voiced bilabial stop in rucci).</s>
elicker, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "elicker" and "jamb," have entirely different consonant sounds. However, they do share the same vowel sound. In "elicker," the vowel sound is /ɪ/ (e sound that can be found at the beginning of "eat"), and in "jamb," it is also /ɪ/ sound (e sound that can be found at the beginning of "eight"). The consonant sounds in "elicker" are "l" and "k," while in "jamb," they are "t" and "m." In total, "elicker" and "jamb" differ only by one letter, and the vowel and consonant sounds they represent are the same – /ɪ/, while adding 'm' in the end of "jamb" changes it into the vowel sound /ɑm/.</s>
mcnaught, dubord, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "mcnaught-dubord" do have identical vowel sounds, but their consonant sounds differ. This is because the words are just vowel-consonant combinations, which may be used or written differently in different contexts. Their vowel sounds are the same (/aʊt/), for example, which is a sound that can be present in both words, while their consonant sounds, however, have different letters in each word—'m' in 'mcnaught' and 'n' in 'dubord'. 

Specifically, in "mcnaught," it is pronounced as /m k n t ɔʊ t/, and in "dubord," it is pronounced as /d b ʊ r d/. The changes in pronunciation result from the distinct way they are written and have no connection with the vowel sounds in the words.</s>
dairy, ghezzi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words "dairy-ghezzi" have different consonant sounds but share the same vowel sounds.</s>
gotten, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the words "gotten" and "ken" the vowel sound remains the same, but the consonant sounds are different. The first word "gotten" has a different consonant sound in the word "got" as compared to the consonant used in the word "hen", while the "ken" word is identical in both.</s>
encase, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. These words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the words "encase" and "prom", the consonant sounds are different as "k" in "encase" and "pr" in "prom". Additionally, the vowel sound is different in "case" and "e" is the only vowel that is the same in both words. The vowel sound in "encase" is [e:], a diphthong which means it's one sound that is broken down into two parts, while the vowel sound in "prom" is [o̠m], with the schwa sound [ə] and then a voiced alveolar plosive [m].</s>
cayne, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

After analyzing the vowels and consonants in the words "cayne" and "boren," we can determine that both words have identical vowel sounds (i.e., /aɪ/ for "cayne" and /oʊ/ for both words after the '-e' sound) but different consonant sounds. The first consonant in "cayne" is /k/, which is not present in "boren."</s>
zeoli, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zeoli-gemme" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are /i:/ in both words (as in "pie"), while the unique consonant sounds are /l/ in "zeoli" and /m/ in "gemme" (as in "tree" and "key" respectively).</s>
tsuda, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tsuda-caen" have identical vowel sounds (/juːdə-kɛn/) but different consonant sounds (/tsuːdə-kɛn/). The main difference in these words lies in the consonant sounds made before each vowel.</s>
sheilah, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sheilah-koehne" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The difference lies in the consonants "h" and "e" in the first word and "n" in the second word.</s>
blasini, mcgreevy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word "blasini," the pattern of consonant sounds in the beginning and the end are the same as in the word "mcgreevy." Both words have a "bl" sound at the beginning, a "t" sound in the middle, and a "v" sound at the end. However, there are minor differences in the consonant sounds; the beginning of "blasini" has a "b" sound, while the beginning of "mcgreevy" has no consonant. 

Furthermore, both words have the same vowel sounds: "ai" in the middle. 

So, while there are similarities in both words' consonant and vowel sounds, there is a slight difference in the beginning consonant sound of "blasini" compared to "mcgreevy."</s>
cannery, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words 'cannery' and 'smolen' have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words lies in the consonant sounds at the start, which are 'C' and 'S' respectively.</s>
schiller, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In "schiller", the vowel sound is /ɪ/, which is the same as the vowel sound in "hills," and "orson" the vowel sound is /ɔː/, which is the same as the vowel sound in "horses." The difference lies in the consonant sounds starting the words: /ʃ/ in "schiller" and /ɔːrsən/ in "orson." So, while they share the same vowel sounds, the consonants create a difference in pronunciation.</s>
sighed, multiprocessor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
freres, vents, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds.

In "freres," the vowel sounds are i and a with long o, which are different from the vowel sounds in "vents." Additionally, the consonant sounds in "freres" are f, r, and s, while the sounds in "vents" are v and n.</s>
yancy, batley, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "yancy" and "batley" have identical vowel sounds and a nearly identical pattern of consonant sounds. The only difference is the endings 'y' in "yancy" and the "t" in "batley," but these differences in consonants do not alter the vowel sounds. It's also worth mentioning that these words are spelled using different capitalization, but that doesn't change their sound either.</s>
zidek, winslett, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "zidek-winslett" do not have identical vowel sounds. 

Justification: In the provided words, the words have different vowel sounds and distinct consonant sounds. Zidek has the vowel sound of "i", while "winslett" has the vowel sound of "ay". The consonant sounds are also different; while "z" in "zidek" is the voiceless z sound, in "winslett," it's the voiced z sound. The pronunciation of both words is different.</s>
honan, doldrums, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds, but they have different consonant sounds.

Explanation: 
"Honan" and "Doldrums" have some similarities. However, the similarity between these two words lies solely in the resemblance of their consonant sounds, not their vowel sounds. 

"Honan" starts with a different sounding "h" at the beginning, sounding more like "haww" and the "n" is different from the "N" sound in "Doldrums". The sounds in the word "honan" also don't resemble the vowel sounds found in the word "doldrums." The vowel sounds in "honan" are "o," and in "doldrums," it's "o". Thus, it is not applicable to say the words have "identical vowel sounds".

The two words "honan" and "doldrums" represent entirely different groupings, each with its own distinct sound. The words are not interchangeable due to their distinct vowel sounds and different consonant sounds.</s>
fusco, hugo's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "fusco-hugo's", have identical vowel sounds (i.e., /a/) but different consonant sounds. The difference lies in the consonants /f/ and /h/, which alter the phonetic form of the words. In "fusco-hugo's", the /f/ is typically pronounced as in the word "foot" and changes the vowel sounds that follow it, while in "hugo's" the /h/ is typically pronounced as in the word "hat" and leads to the vowel sounds that follow it. 

The main thing that remains the same in both words is the vowel sounds, /a/, /o/ and the silent 's', with the exception of the distinctly different consonant sounds at the beginning of both words. Hence, these words are pronounced differently but have a unique consonant and vowel sounds that set them apart.</s>
vesper, theberge, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vesper" and "theberge" have the following vowel sounds in common:
- "V" in "vesper" is pronounced similarly to "T" in "theberge."
- "E" in "vesper" is pronounced similarly to "E" in "theberge."
- "S" in "vesper" is pronounced similarly to "T" in "theberge" (except for a "th" sound in "them").

However, they differ in the following consonant sounds:
- "B" in "theberge" is pronounced as "P" in "vesper."

So, yes, they have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
shatt, frans, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds ('a') but different consonant sounds. 'Shatt' and 'Frans' both start with the same sound, followed by different consonant sounds ('sh' and 'f').</s>
sheley, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "sheley-braner", do have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only consonant difference between the two words is the 'r' in "sheley" and "r" in "braner". Vowels can be identified by their long or short marks and combinations of vowels are often united by a silent 'i' or 'e'. To determine if two words have the same vowel sounds, one need only count the number of long or short marks in their vowel combinations.</s>
saudi, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in the words "saudi" and "gettin'" are distinct. In "saudi," the first vowel sound is short ("a"), and in "gettin'", the first vowel sound is long ("ee"). The consonant sounds are different as well - "saudi" starts with "s," while "gettin'" begins with "g".</s>
vaughan, hmong, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in vaughan and hmong are identical and the consonant sounds in these two words are different. So the two words have different consonant sounds but the same vowel sound.</s>
shelley, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
duly, ruthie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. This is because both words, "duly" and "ruthie," have the same vowel sounds (/ɪ/ and /ɜ:/), but they differ in the consonant sounds at the beginning of the words. The word "duly" has the /d/ sound, while the word "ruthie" has the /r/ sound. However, in this case, the similarity in vowel sound is what makes these words similar and different.</s>
leon, seema, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word "Leon," the two vowels are represented by the vowel sound 'a' – in Spanish, this sound is pronounced as [a]. This is why the word starts with a 'le'. 

In the word "Seema", the first vowel (also 'a') gets pronounced as the same sound [a] in Spanish. However, the second vowel 'e' in "Seema" is pronounced as [e]. 

The justifications here are given from an phonetic perspective that looks at the actual sounds made when humans pronounce words.</s>
excelling, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds in both words are actually the same, as they both contain the same phonetic vowel sequence. The differences lie in the consonant sounds, which are distinct. In "excelling," the first two consonants "ex" are pronounced more firmly and consistently. In contrast, the "chloro" in "chlorofluorocarbons" is spoken with more emphasis on the "chloro" part due to the chemical nature of the words.</s>
average, klapperich, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "average-klapperich" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words lies in the consonant sounds and the way they are arranged, but their vowel sounds remain the same.</s>
kinne, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words 'kinne-smolen' contain identical vowel sounds but distinct consonant sounds. The word 'kinne-smolen' consists of four syllables where the unstressed syllables /'n/-, /'m/-, and /-em/ are identical. Despite having different consonant sounds, the vowel sounds remain the same.</s>
articles, amundsen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "articles-Amundsen" has identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The vowel sounds in the word "articles" are 'a' (in "articles") and 'e' (in "articles"). The vowel sounds in the word "Amundsen" are 'a' (in "Amundsen") and 'e' (in "Amundsen").

The consonant sounds in the word "articles" includes 't', 'r', 's', 's', 't', and 'r' (from left to right), while the consonant sounds in the word "Amundsen" includes 'a', 'm', 'u', 'n', 'd', 's', 'e' (from left to right).

So, the only difference between the words in terms of vowel and consonant sounds is the "e" sound in the first word, while the "Amundsen" word switches the preceding vowel sounds to a different combination of 'a', 'm', 'u', 'n', 'd', 's', 'e'.</s>
townshend, houseware, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
worshipping, jurkiewicz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given word pair "worshipping-jurkiewicz" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in both words are "w-sh-ing" and "j-rk-w-cz." The key factor in determining if they have the same vowel sounds is that they both contain the same sequence of vowels: "w-sh-ing" and "j-rk-w-cz" both have the same vowel sounds 'o' (as in 'boot'), 'ow' (as in 'cow'), 'ew' (as in 'ew'), and 'ow' (again, as in 'cow'). The consonant sounds in both pairs are different, however, as the first word has 'w' (as in 'wet'), 'sh' (as in 'she'), and 'ing' (a common ending for verbs that makes it soft), while the second word contains 'j' (as in 'jail'), 'rk' (as in 'ruck'), and 'w' (as in 'who') before the ending 'cz' (as in 'church'; the 'cz' ending is a Polish sound not found in English).</s>
o'shell, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
arbo, vasko, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. The word "arbo-vasko" consists of the words "arbo" and "vasko". "Arbo" has a single vowel sound that starts with the consonant 'a', while "vasko" also has a single vowel sound but is in a different position in the word. Although the vowel sounds are different (the first part being "a" and the second part being "o"), the consonant sounds are similar, as they both start with a "v" sound.</s>
ozelle, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In both "ozelle" and "primo," the vowel sound remains constant (an [ɪ] sound), but the consonant sounds are different. In "ozelle," the consonant is the "v" sound, while in "primo," it is the "p" sound. Despite this difference in the consonant sounds, all other phonetic components remain the same, including the vowel sounds.</s>
sowder, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "sowder" and "nex" have identical vowel sounds (SOW-der, NEX) and different consonant sounds. They are homophones, which means they sound the same but have different meanings or spellings.</s>
incase, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In "incase-jam," the first word has identical vowel sounds, /i/ and /a/, but different consonant sounds /n/ and /m/. In the second word, "jam," the vowel sounds are /i/ and /a/, and the second word also has different consonant sounds: /ʒ/ and /j/.</s>
moe, poe's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "moe-poe" have identical vowel sounds ("oo" sound) but different consonant sounds. The first word "moe" has the "eh" sound, while the second word "poe" has the "ow" sound.</s>
keener, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'keener' and 'prom' indeed have identical vowel sounds, but they differ in the consonant sounds. In English, words usually rhyme when their vowel sounds are identical, and the consonant sounds generally add to the overall pronunciation but don't change the rhyme of the words.</s>
wetsuit, zhengzhou, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "wetsuit" and "zhengzhou" have identical vowel sounds – namely "ee" – but they differ in terms of consonant sounds. Specifically:

1. In "wetsuit," the vowel sound "ee" is pronounced after the "s" and "t" consonant sounds, represented as "ss" and "tt" using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The letters at those positions, "s" and "t," produce a slight constriction sound, which the IPA symbols represent as "ss" and "tt."

2. In "zhengzhou," the vowel sound "ee" again appears after the "z" and "g" consonant sounds, represented by the IPA symbol "zh" (which corresponds to the "z" sound) and "ng" (which corresponds to the "g" sound). The letters at those positions, "z" and "g," produce a more open sound compared to "s" and "t," respectively.

In summary, the two words share the identical "ee" vowel sound, but have different consonant sounds primarily due to the positions of the consonants "s" and "t" in "wetsuit," and the consonants "z" and "g" in "zhengzhou."</s>
shelly, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two given words, "shelly" and "guyton," do have identical vowel sounds (a, e, i, o, and u) but different consonant sounds. However, it is essential to note that both words are spelled phonetically, and their differences result from spelling variations rather than phonetic differences in vowel and consonants.</s>
typo, heico's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "typo-heico's" have identically arranged vowel sounds, but the consonant sounds are different. Typical phonetic analysis shows that heico's (spelled hīkō's) is an American English compound word consisting of two words "hīko" and "'s." 

However, its spelling and phonetics are significantly different due to the added consonant in "typo" (also spelled tīpo), and the resulting change in pronunciation and spelling of the remaining words and letters:

- Words in their correct forms:
 - Original: hīko + "'s" = hiiko's
 - Spelled as typo-heico's (with added consonant in typo to spell tīpo): tīpo-hīko's

In this case, the difference in consonant sounds comes from the inclusion of the letter "p" in the word "typo," which changes the pronunciation of the other words. Despite having identical vowel sounds, the consonant sounds are different as a result of this alteration in the spelling.</s>
saunier, altier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the given phrase "saunier-altier," the vowel sounds remain the same between the two words, while the consonant sounds differ due to the shifts in pronunciation of specific letters.

In "saunier," the initial vowel "a" pronounces as [a]. This vowel sound remains consistent with "saunier-altier." On the other hand, the consonant sounds change. In "saunier," the letter "S" is pronounced as in the word "say," which is [s]. However, in "saunier-altier," the "S" is pronounced as in the word "see," which is [s].

Additionally, in "saunier," the "n" is a voiced velar plosive "n" [ŋ], while in "saunier-altier," the "n" is a voiced uvular plosive "n" [n]. Finally, in "saunier," the "r" is a voiced retroflex fricative [r], which is pronounced differently from the voiced uvular fricative [ʁ] in "saunier-altier."

In summary, while the vowel sounds remain the same, the consonant sounds differ between "saunier" and "saunier-altier," which justifies the answer "yes".</s>
kapuscinski, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kapustinski-roesner" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. However, they are not spelled correctly. When adjusted for correct spelling (caputinski-roesner), the words would have the same consonant sounds as well, but with still different vowel sounds. 

It seems that you made an error in transcribing the words and the vowel sounds should be swapped. "Caputinski" could be spelled as "kaputinski", creating a word with the identical vowel sounds but changed consonant sounds. So, the initial statement that "kapustinski-roesner" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds seems valid, but the words could be adjusted for correct spelling.</s>
kuhn, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "kuhn-electoral" have identical vowel sounds ("oo" in "ooyun" and "ektorial") and just different consonant sounds. Each word has a "k" in the first syllable followed by consonants. In "kuhn" the 'k' is pronounced with a light breathy sound due to the unstressed syllable. In "electoral" the 'k' is a normal 'k' sound.</s>
highman, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. Although both words "highman" and "braner" share the same vowel sounds (/aɪ/) and (/bɾ/), there are different consonant sounds. In "highman," the first consonant sound is /h/, and in "braner," it is /b/.</s>
pique, lee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The words "pique-lee" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. While they feature the same vowels at the beginning, the second and third parts of the word, "pique" vs "lee," differ. "Pique" is Spanish for "piquancy" or "spiciness," whereas "lee" is a place name. Regardless of the root languages, the two separate words both contain the same vowel sound combination at the beginning, but use different consonant sounds.</s>
soady, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
spec, schwent, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have the same consonant sounds. 

To break it down, the first word, "spec-schwent" has the following consonant sounds: 
Spec: "ss"
sch: "sh"
went: "wnt"

The second word, "spec-schwent", also has the following consonant sounds:
Spec: "ss"
sch: "sh"
went: "wnt"

It's just that the order of the consonants is different in the two words. But the vowel sounds (short "a" in "spec-schwent" and long "a" in "spec-schwent") remain the same.</s>
holsey, rosie's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. They also have different meanings. "Holsey" is an Irish surname, while "Rosie's" is a possessive pronoun indicating ownership of a person named Rosie. The only similarity in spelling is the presence of the letter 'o' in both words, but these words have distinct pronunciation and definitions.</s>
bossier, hollier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
ramstein, azides, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words "ramstein-azides" have the following vowel sounds: a, e, i, n, a, and s. While the two words do share some vowel sounds, "ramstein" has a different vowel sound in the first syllable (ai) and the last word contains a different consonant sound that does not exist in the second word (the soft "c" sound is replaced by the hard "s" in "azides").</s>
necaise, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
appraise, mcclain, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words share the same vowel sounds but differ in consonant sounds. Despite the difference in consonants used, the sounds represented by 'a, e, i, and o' do remain the same through both words. Therefore, the vowel sounds 'a, e, i, and o' are the same and constitute their identically.</s>
saunier, portier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds of "saunier-portier" are identical, but the consonant sounds differ. All the letters in the word starting from the 5th letter (i.e., "i") are different, including a and e, hence the differing consonant sounds.</s>
good's, tooke, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these two words have different vowel sounds. Good's-tooke has one possible pronunciation: "go-oh-d-s-to-ok." However, the words you mentioned (goods-tooke) have two possible pronunciations: "g-d-s-to-ok" (the accent moves from the first syllable to the second and emphasizes the word "tooke") and "go-ood-s-to-ok" (emphasis on "go-ood").</s>
hurried, pursley, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word "hurried", the vowel sounds are the same (/aɪˈreɪd/). However, the word "pursley" has a different set of consonant sounds (/pəˈruːsli/). So, they both have the same vowel sounds but distinct consonant sounds that differentiate them.</s>
conti, army's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds between "conti" and "army's" are not identical; "o" in "conti" is pronounced differently than "a" in "army's". The consonant sounds between the words are different as well—"s" in "conti" is a voiced alveolar fricative /s/, and it is a voiceless bilabial fricative /z/ in "army's". There's also a space between "-" and "army's". 

So, in this case, the words are not homophones because the vowels and consonants used are not identical, despite being pronounced similarly in phonetics. However, both words share a starting consonant.</s>
walser, pauper, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. 

In the word "walser", the vowel sound in "a" is different from its counterpart in "pauper". The vowel sound is a "w" sound and an "ao" sound respectively. The consonant sounds, however, are almost the same in both words. The first word, "walser", ends with a "ll" sound, while the second word, "pauper", ends with a "p" sound.</s>
schaal, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "schaal" (pronounced [sxaal]) and "zel" (pronounced [ze:l]) contain identical vowel sounds ([xa:] and [e:]) with the exception of the consonant sounds. The consonant sounds in each word are slightly different, but they are not enough to change the overall vowel sounds. Therefore, these words have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
gitano, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. The words "gitano" and "reasner" have different vowel sounds and consonant sounds.</s>
zulli, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "zulli" and "premo," have identical vowel sounds. Both words contain the vowel "o." However, the consonant sounds vary: "zulli" starts with "z" and ends with "w," while "premo" starts with "p" and ends with "m." Therefore, they are not interchangeable.</s>
cathodes, gatos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cathodes" and "gatos" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
dewinter, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "dewinter-bowron," have identical vowel sounds, but different consonant sounds. As a result, they are distinct and cannot be pronounced the same. The vowel sounds are "dew" and "bow," while the consonant sounds are present in the letters "d," "e," "nu," and "w."

The only common element in these two words is that the vowel sound in "dew" (in "dewinter") and in "wo" (in "bowron") are pronounced in a near identical way. So, the core of both words is the exact same, but the surrounding consonant sounds are different, which leads to these words not having the same pronunciation.</s>
tsuda, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. "Tsuda" and "Jimmie" have the similar-sounding vowel sounds "i" and "y" as the first and second vowels, but "tsuda" has the "t" and "d" consonant sounds, while "Jimmie" has the "d" and "d" consonant sounds.</s>
shiller, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the words "shiller" and "gemme," the vowel sounds are the same (an "a" sound) but the consonant sounds are different. The first word has two "sh" sounds, while the second word has a "g" sound followed by a "m" sound.</s>
bryon, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words bryon-prem have identical vowel sounds ("a" and "a") but different consonant sounds ("b" and "p" respectively). One is pronounced "brion" and the other is pronounced "prem".</s>
eno, expo, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In "eno-expo," the first vowel (/ɛn/) and the last vowel (/ɒ/) have different vowel sounds, while the other vowels in both words have the same vowel sounds. The consonant sounds, however, are different between the two words: /ɛn/ vs. /ɛks/, /ɒ/ vs. /ɒks/.</s>
dicky, wintry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In the words "dicky-wintry," the vowel sounds are the same (/aɪ/ and /aɪ/), but each word has different consonant sounds: "d" in "dicky" and "w" in "wintry."</s>
garuda, ablutions, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>

caen, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
cnet, friedhelm, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cnet-friedhelm" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The differences come from the replacement of letters in "cnet-friedhelm."

The original form, "cnet," starts with the identical vowel sound 'c', and they are identical in this regard. The second part of the form "friedhelm" consists of different consonant sounds with "f" sounding like the same initial sound in "dog" or "cat" and a "d" sound like in "dress." However, they are still pronounced with the same vowel sound: "ee." Here is a breakdown of the pronunciation of both words:

Original form: "cnet" - same consonant sound, different vowel sound (same as "snet")
Same consonant sounds in the second word:
1. "f" sound in "fried" (same as in "foot")
2. "r" sound in "ried" (same as in "ride")
3. "i" sound in "ed" (same as in "red")
The final consonant "l" sound is the same, but "em" in "friedhelm" is pronounced with a different vowel sound from "dnet" because 'm' sounds like "much" rather than 'n' in "cat" or "monkey."

In conclusion, the two terms have different consonant sounds but retain the identical vowel sound.</s>
elisa, nekia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "elisa-nekia" have identical vowel sounds (E in both words), but the consonant sounds differ. The only difference is the "s" sound in "elisa" and the "k" sound in "nekia."</s>

In "mongold," the vowel sounds are [ɒ] in "mong," [ɪ] in "old," and [ɡ] in "good." In "washoe," the vowel sounds are [a] in "wash," [ʃ] in "shoe," [o] in "wash," and [e] in "shoe." However, the consonant sounds in both words are different - [m], [ɔ], [ɡ] in "mongold," and [w], [aː], [ʃ] in "washoe." So, the vowel sounds are the same in both words, but the consonant sounds are different. This is why the sentence "Do these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds? mongold-washoe" is grammatically correct and true.</s>
hoeppner, lowder, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "hoeppner-lowder" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

cartilage, pondimin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "cartilage" and "pondimin" have identical vowel sounds (i.e., 'i' and 'e'), which is what differentiates them as two separate words. However, the consonant sounds are different – "cartilage" consists of 'c', 'a', 'r', 't', 'i', 'l', and 'a', while "pondimin" has 'p', 'o', 'n', 'd', 'i', 'm', and 'i'. Thus, the vowel sounds are the same, but the consonant sounds are distinct. Therefore, the answer is Yes.</s>
kinny, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds because of the consonant clusters and final sounds. "Kinny" and "Summerlin" both have the same vowel sounds (with an emphasis on the second vowel in "summerlin," which is still pronounced the same), but the consonants they include are unique. Thus, they may not be pronounced identically, and there are distinctions at both the beginning and end of the words.</s>
schuele, gemmer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuele" and "gemmer" both have identical vowel sounds (a, a, o, e, e), but have different consonant sounds.

Despite the different consonant sounds, they are closer in meaning, possibly referring to an artist and an ancient king, respectively.</s>
necks, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "necks" and "zarroli," have identical vowel sounds because the vowels "n" and "z" are the only ones different in each word, and they are in the same position in both words. The consonant sounds differ in the words, with "zarroli" having an "r" sound at the end instead of a "k" sound.</s>
spake, jails, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds. 

In the word "spake," the vowel sound is represented by the letter "a," as in the word "hat." In the word "jails," the vowel sound is represented by the letter "e," as in the word "bet."

So, the consonant sounds are different.</s>
two-way, prunedale, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In "two-way-prunedale," the vowel sounds are /o/, /w/, and /o/:

1. The first word has all consonant sounds, and the vowel sounds don't match the ones in the second word.
2. The second word's vowel sounds are /ɔ/, /w/, and /o/:

To better showcase this, you can listen to the sounds and see they are different. Also, you can analyze phonetics to identify changes in pronunciation. Hence, these two words do not have identical, albeit similar vowel sounds and different consonant sounds.</s>
osmer, jocular, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "osmer" and "jocular" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Specifically, they share the vowel sound "o" and the vowel sound "i" as part of the same word or pronounced separately. 

The first vowel sound "o" is present in both words, as well as the second vowel sound "i". Even the "s" sound in "osmer" and the "j" sound in "jocular" may seem similar for many, but they are distinct from each other. 

The main difference lies in their consonant sounds, with "osmer" ending in "rm" while "jocular" ends in "lr". Despite this slight difference, the pronunciation of vowel sounds in these words results in the same general sound.</s>
kinny, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kinny-jam" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The first word, "kinny-jam," is written as "kin" and "jam," where "j" is a stopped alveolar approximant sound and "g" makes consonant sound.

negev, telexed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "negev-telexed" possess identical vowel sounds (i.e., ee, ee) but different consonant sounds in some of their syllables. In this case, the initial vowels of the words are identical as indicated by the ee sound, while the consonant sounds (n, t, x) vary. The difference in the consonant sounds is caused by the following consonants - "n" in "negev," "t" in "-telexed," and "x" in "telexed."</s>
vandeberg, casler, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds in "vandeberg" and "casler" are different: 
- In the word "vandeberg," the stress is on the first syllable, and the vowel sound in "van" is short i: "van". There is no diphthong or sliding of the vowel sound.
- In the word "casler," the stress is on the second syllable, and the vowel sound in "cas" is short i: "cas". The vowel sound in "ler" is diphthongized, which means that it slides from a short high vowel sound (schwa) to a long low vowel sound (aw): "lɛr". 

So, the vowel sounds in these two words are not identical but different, as one follows the schwa-high vowel pattern whereas the other follows the sliding high-low vowel pattern.</s>
off-day, maltase, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "off-day-maltase" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In this response, I used a definition-based approach. First, I identified the vowel sounds in each word by analyzing the vowels in the words, which are 'o', 'a', 'i', 'e', and 'm'. These vowel sounds are consistent across all the words. 

Next, I examined the consonant sounds. In the first word ("off-day"), there might be a minor variation between 'f' and 'v', but it's so subtle that human ears can't tell the difference, so it doesn't significantly affect the vowel sounds. The second word, "maltase" has a similar 'm' and 'l' consonant sounds to the second and third words, respectively. So, the consonant sounds in each word are very similar indeed, with only minor differences between 'v' and 'f' and 'l' vs. 'm'.

Therefore, the vowel sounds are consistent, but the consonant sounds vary slightly between each word. Thus, they can be said to have 'identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds'.</s>
oecd, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "oecd-sterilizations" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In this string of words, the vowel sounds remain the same, but the consonant sounds differ at each position. For example:

2. "e" in "oecd" vs. "e" in "sterilizations"
3. "c" in "oecd" vs. "s" in "sterilizations"
4. "d" in "oecd" vs. "g" in "sterilizations"
5. "s" in "oecd" vs. "n" in "sterilizations"
6. "s" in "sterilizations" vs. "s" in "sterilizations" (there is an extra "s" in "sterilizations")

In summary, the vowel sounds are the same, but the consonant sounds change at each position, making them different.</s>

The words "briner" and "jemmie" both have the same vowel sounds, specifically 'ee', which is the sound of the e in "meat", and 'oo', which is the sound of the oo in "boot". However, they differ in the consonant sounds, as "briner" starts with a "b" and "jemmie" starts with a "j".</s>
schoeller, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only similarity between the words "schoeller-brun" and "schoeller" is that both words start with the same vowel sound "sch" (IPA: ʃ), but the rest of the words have different consonant sounds. In the first word "schoeller-brun," the final consonant is "rn" (IPA: ɽ), while in the second word "schoeller" the final consonant is "l" (IPA: l). Therefore, they do not have identical vowel sounds.</s>
chalet, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "chalet" and "breon", possess identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The primary vowel sound in both words is "ea" as in "team." However, the presence of two distinct consonant sounds leads to their distinctions: 
- In "chalet," the "ch" at the front of the word creates a "ch" sound, followed by "aa" as in "bath."
- In "breon," the pronunciation begins with a silent letter "b," followed by "re" as in "red." The "on" segment of the word forms the "on" sound as in "son."</s>
snoops, cools, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words snoops and cools have identical vowel sounds (o and o) and similar consonant sounds (s, shifts from c to k, and s) but different endings. These words are homophones (words that sound the same but have different meanings or spellings).</s>
shelor, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "shelor" and "easel" do share identical vowel sounds (a, e, e) but have different consonant sounds (sh, s, l). Both are spelled using the same vowels but with different consonants.</s>
connery, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in the words connery-barrineau are identical (the 'e' sound), but the consonant sounds are different. Connery has the consonant 'n' in the middle of its two syllables, whereas barrineau has the consonant 'r' in the first syllable. This is why the vowel sounds are the same (e), but the consonant sounds are different.</s>
louck, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned, "louck-jimmie," have the same vowel sounds (/lʊ.k-dʒɪ.mɪ/) but different consonant sounds.</s>
muecke, snoops, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "muecke-snoops" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The same three vowels are used in each word (i, a, and o), but the consonant sounds are different. In "muecke," the "u" and "e" sounds are rolled together, and in "snoops," the "s" has a harder consonant sound. This creates an overall similar sound, but each word still has its unique consonant sounds.</s>
garuda, pakula, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || A: Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Explanation:
The words "garuda-pakula" share the same vowel sounds: "a" in "garuda" and "u" in "pakula." However, the consonant sounds are different. The first word, "garuda," starts with the consonant sound "g," while the second word, "pakula," starts with the consonant sound "p". Although the vowel sounds are the same, the consonant sounds are different.</s>
irving, curlin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "irving" and "curlin" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds in the two words are "a" in "irving" and "a" in "curlin." The consonant sounds are different: "r" in "irving" and "l" in "curlin."</s>
hammering, klapperich, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sheley, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words, "sheley" and "gemma," do not have identical vowel sounds, as they have different vowel patterns. The first word, "sheley," has the vowel sound of 'sh' at the beginning, followed by two different vowel sounds, 'ee' and 'lee' (pronounced like the sound of 'life'). The second word, "gemma," has a vowel sound of 'g', followed by three different vowel sounds: 'em', 'ma', and 'aa' (pronounced like the sound of 'dream'). The consonant sounds between the vowels also differ.</s>
scholey, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scholey-necks" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

The vowel sounds in both words are "a" in "ch" and "ecks." The other vowel sounds in each word are the same: "o" in "sh" and "o" in "necks." The consonant sounds are different between the two words; "sch" in "scholey" is a different consonant sound than "sh" in "necks." In summary, while they have the same vowel sounds, the words have different consonant sounds making them distinct words when pronounced.</s>
gilbert, kicker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds in "gilbert" and "kicker" are the same. However, the consonants in each word differ. "Gilbert" starts with "g", "k" is the next consonant, then "i" appears twice, "l", and "b" appear once, and "t" is the last consonant. In "kicker", "k" is the first and only consonant, followed by "i" twice, "c", "k", and "e" twice. The consonants in each word are distinct, but they share the same vowel sounds.</s>
gahm, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gahm-excelling" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Explanation: In both words, the vowel sounds "a" and "e" are the same - as in the words "ham" and "cigarette". The only difference is in the consonant sounds. In the word "gahm-excelling", the consonant "g" is silent, making it "ham". In the word "excelling", the consonant "h" is there, so the word sounds like "hahm-excelling". Therefore, the similarity of vowel sounds remains the same, and only the consonants are different.</s>
restroom, zhengzhou, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds ā,ē,ī,ō,ū (in the word "restroom") and ā,ē,ī,ō,ū (in the word "zhengzhou"), but they have different consonant sounds. The main difference is in the consonant sounds of the following letters: 

In "restroom," the consonants are t, r, s, t, m, and o.
In "zhengzhou," the consonants are zh, j, n, g, z, and h. The "zh" in "zheng" is similar to "ch" in "chart," so while they are not exactly the same, they are quite close. Also, the "ng" sound in "zheng" is similar to the "ng" sound in "sing" and "singing."</s>
ashley, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ashley-hermann" share the identical vowel sounds because all the vowels 'a', 'i', 'o', 'u', appear in both words. However, they differ in the consonant sounds, with 'ashley' starting with 'sh' and 'hermann' starting with 'h'.</s>
freres, nel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The similarity between the words lies in the way the vowel sounds are pronounced, but the distinctiveness comes from the unique consonant sounds. Thus, freres and nel are not interchangeable; they are distinctly different words.</s>
thereto, jeju, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gotten, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, 'gotten-summerlin', have the same vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The difference between these two words lies in the consonants, primarily at the beginning of the words. 'gotten' has consonant sound at the beginning (a hard 'g'), while 'summerlin' (or 'Su-more-lin') starts with a soft 's' followed by another 'm' with a voiceless consonant sound. So, in terms of vowel sounds (i.e., the sounds made by the vowels themselves), the two words are identical. However, the key difference is the consonant sounds preceding the vowels.</s>
shatt, scam, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds of "shatt" and "scam" are identical (both having the vowel sound of /e/). However, the difference lies in the consonant sounds where "shatt" has /ʃ/ (a voiceless velar fricative) and "scam" has /s/ (a voiced bilabial stop).</s>
huguet, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the provided words 'huguet-caen' both have identical vowel sounds, as they both contain the same sequence of vowels (i.e., "i-y-a-u-e-u"). However, the consonant sounds are different: "huguet" has a "g" before the "u" which is not present in "caen".</s>
knacks, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds /knacks/ and /dewinter/ are identical, but the consonant sounds are different, with "knacks" starting with a voiceless fricative /k/ and "dewinter" starting with a voiced fricative /d/.</s>
kutscher, runner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "kutscher" and "runner" do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

Explanation: The words "kutscher" and "runner" share some common vowel sounds. The sounds /æ/, /ə/, and /ɪ/ in both words appear in the same order. However, the consonant sounds in the two words are different. In "kutscher," there are three consonant sounds that don't exist in the consonant sounds of "runner": /k/, /t/, and /ʃ/. Conversely, in "runner" there are three additional consonant sounds not found in "kutscher": /r/, /n/, and /ər/. Therefore, they do not have an exact letter-to-sound correspondence in their consonant sounds, but their vowel sounds are identical.</s>
kissling, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "kissling" and "ozelle," have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
roath, hoechst's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These words, "roath" and "hoechst's," do not have identical vowel sounds, but they do share a common consonant sound. The main difference lies in their vowel sounds: "roath" has an /ɔ/vowel sound, while "hoechst's" has a /ʊ/vowel sound. Regardless, it's the same principle as when we consider two words with different vowel sounds but identical consonant sounds.</s>
indium, cypriots, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes
The words "indium" and "cypriots" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The similarity in vowel sounds comes from the ɪndɪum ɪɡˈzɪɡ.ɪt iːst ɪɡ.zɪk-rɪst ɪɡ.zɪk-rɪst ɪɡˈzɪɡ.ɪt iːst ɪɡ.zɪk-rɪst pronunciation but the differences lie in their consonants. Indium is pronounced as /ɪndɪm/ whereas cypriots is pronounced as /saɪpraɪtəs/. They both end with a similar series of sounds, /s/.</s>
trachtenberg, hamler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the words "trachtenberg" and "hamler", the only difference lies in the consonants used. "Trachtenberg" features a 'T' while "hamler" features a 'H'. This change in consonant results in the pronunciation and spelling of these words being different.

However, the vowel sounds remain the same throughout both words, which is why the label "Yes" fits here. Each word consists of a vowel sequence followed by consonant sequence, the vowels being identical, hence the name "identical vowel sounds" in this context. 

This concept also applies to the word "trachtenberg" in which no vowels but only a single consonant ('T') change from its original form to "hamler". 

It is worth noting that there could be slight variations in pronunciation between these words - especially at the more subtle vowel sounds between "h" and "t", but in most cases, experienced English speakers will likely hear the two words without any problem.</s>
janelle, affects, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
minasian, effacing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

In both words, the vowels sounds are the same while the consonant sounds are different. This is due to the fact that both words share the same underlying phonetic structure: /minA:sjɛn/ and /ɛfəkərɪndə/. The vowel sound [i] in both words is pronounced identically, and the vowel sequences /ai:/ in "minasian" and /ɛl/: in "effacing" also share their corresponding vowel sounds. The other vowels, /A:/ in both cases, are pronounced exactly the same as well. 

The only difference between the two words lies in the consonant sounds - "d" in "minasian" and "r" in "effacing".</s>
canney, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "canney" and "obryan" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The primary difference between these two words lies in the consonant sounds. "Canney" consists of two consonants, "c" and "n", while "obryan" has five consonants, "o", "b", "r", "y", and "n". The consonant sounds are distinct, but they share the same vowel sounds, as both words follow the same basic structure of the syllable (CV) and the same fundamental vowel. Therefore, they can be considered to have the same vowel sounds but differ in the consonant sounds and the pronunciation of each individual letter.</s>
jasmina, ludwiga, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
silsby, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words do not have identical vowel sounds. 

The first word, "silsby," has the vowel sounds ['s', 'ɪ', 'z', 'b', 'aɪ']. 
The second word, "kian," has the vowel sounds ['k', 'i:', 'n'].

The vowel sounds in both words differ - "silsby" has an 'I' sound at the beginning, while "kian" has a 'E:N' sound.</s>
worked, hurl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "worked-hurl," have different consonant sounds but identical vowel sounds. The only vowel sound in both words is the vowel /u:/. The only difference in the consonant sounds is the /k/-to-/h/ change in the second word, which makes the pronunciation distinct.</s>
thee, pleads, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words have identical vowel sounds (i, i, i) but different consonant sounds (p in "pleads" versus t in "three").</s>
shelor, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelor" and "smolen" have identical vowel sounds (i.e., ei) but different consonant sounds. The first word has a 'sh' initial consonant, while the second word has a 's' initial consonant.</s>
cannes, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cannes" and "gemme" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both have the same pronunciation for the 'a' and 'e' vowels, as well as the 'm' and 'n' consonants. The only difference lies in the words' meaning; "cannes" is a French town while "gemme" refers to a gemstone.</s>
geico's, pyro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'geico's' and 'pyro' have identical vowel sounds, but they have different consonant sounds. In the first word, 'geico's', the 'e' and 'o' sound same. In the second word, 'pyro', the 'e' and 'o' sounds also remain the same, but the 'y' and 'r' sounds are different. Despite having the same vowel sounds, the changing of consonant sounds makes the two words distinct from each other.</s>
frans, pax, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "frans-pax" have identical vowel sounds. The only difference lies in the consonant sounds. The word "frans" has the same vowel sounds but starts with a different consonant sound, "pax" has the same vowel sounds but ends with a different consonant sound.</s>
soleil, obeyed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. They both start with the same sequence of vowel sounds (schwa + O). The first vowel sound is a schwa (a short unstressed vowel sound), followed by the sounds 'O' in "soleil" and "obeyed". Differences in the consonant sounds include the consonant 'S' in "soleil", and 'Y' in "obeyed".</s>
bantu, caruth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowel sounds are identical: "bantu-caruth" both begin with the vowel "a". However, the consonant sounds differ between the two words.

The word "bantu" begins with "b" (voiceless bilabial plosive), while "caruth" begins with "k" (voiced bilabial plosive). These are different consonant sounds, so the overall sounds of the words are not the same, despite having the same vowel sound.</s>
cowie, chaussee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words (coowie-chaussee) have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.</s>
acid, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

In the word "acid," the vowel sounds are /a/ and /i/. In the word "elcotel," the vowel sounds are /i/ and /ɛətəl/, which are different. The -i- in "acid" is the same /i/ sound, but in "elcotel," the -i- sound is a different, higher-pitched, and longer -i- sound, resulting from a separate vowel sound (/ɛətəl/).</s>
soeder, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'soeder-nyx' have identical vowel sounds - the long "o" in "soeder" and the short "y" in "nyx" - but they differ in their consonants: "s" in "soeder" and "n" in "nyx." The "s" in "soeder" and "n" in "nyx" create the difference in consonant sounds between the two words.</s>
suder, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "suder" and "gotten" do have identical vowel sounds (S, O: /o:/ /o:/) and different consonant sounds (T: /t/: /d/). Both words have the same vowel pattern /o:/ /o:/, which can be seen as a single vocal tone and not as individual vowels. However, the consonant sounds after the vowel are different: "suder" has the consonants /t/, while "gotten" has the consonants /d/.</s>
sheeler, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

In the word "sheeler," the vowel sound in "heeler" is present, the only change being the addition of the consonant "sh" at the beginning. In the word "healthy", the vowel sound in "healthy" is present, with the only change being the deletion of the consonant "sh."</s>
shula, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shula" and "excelling" do have identical vowel sounds but have different consonant sounds. However, the primary function of the pronunciation is to recognize the difference in the meanings and context between the two words.</s>
frans, scam, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words (frans-scam) have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds remain the same ('a') but the consonant sounds change ('f' in 'frans' becomes 's' in 'scam'). The change in consonants results in distinct pronunciations for each word and make them phonologically different.</s>
finery, simerly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. In each word, the only difference is the consonant sounds at the beginning: "f" in "finery" and "s" in "simerly".</s>

Both words have the same vowel sound (/ʊ/), but they differ in the consonant sounds (/θ/ vs. /r/).</s>
balodia, appropriate, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words have vowels that occur in the same order and retain the same melodic contour (length, stress, and tone). Although the consonants differ, the vowel sounds remain the same.

- balodia has the vowels 'a', 'o', 'l', and 'd'
- appropriate has the vowels 'a', 'p', 'r', and 'e'</s>
unleaded, obsessing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words do have the same vowel sounds, but they differ in their consonant sounds. "Unleaded" has the consonant sounds "un", "-led", while "obsessing" has the consonant sounds "o", "-ses", "-s".</s>
agerton, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, those two words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. This is because in the word "agerton," the vowel sounds are a "y" and "er" while in the word "excelling," the vowel sounds are "e," short "a," and "ling."</s>
nex, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds are 'e' in 'ne-x-caen' and 'e' in 'nex-caen'. The consonant sounds are both 'x', but in different places within the words.</s>
olokuei's, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The vowel sounds of both words are "o" and "i", but the rest of the sound in each word is different. In "olokuei", the main consonant is "k", and in "nyx", it is "n". Thus, the consonant sounds in both words differ, creating different overall sounds while sharing the vowel sounds "o" and "i".</s>
falasco, varnado, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "falasco" and "varnado" have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The only consonant present in each word besides the vowel sounds is the "r" in "falasco" and the "n" in "varnado." Hence, they have the same vowel sound (e.g., "a" followed by "o") but different consonants.</s>
kenn, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. The words "kenn-reisenauer" have the following consonants at different places in the word:

1. The word "kenn" contains the consonants "k" and "nn" at the beginning and ending of the word.
2. The word "reisenauer" contains the consonants "r," "s," "i," "n," "s," and "a" in different positions.

Although they have some similar vowel sounds (for example, both words have "e" and "a" sounds, although the vowel "e" in "kenn" is lengthened and the "a" in "reisenauer" is pronounced as a short "a"), the consonant sounds differ significantly between the two words.</s>
brawny, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "brawny" and "gemme," have identical vowel sounds (AE) but different consonant sounds (B vs K in "brawny", N vs M in "gemme").</s>
zarroli, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zarroli" and "ireson" do have the same vowel sounds (/ɑr ə ɫ i/) but different consonant sounds.</s>
colds, roath, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "colds" and "roath" do not have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. 

Justification: The vowel sound in the words is different. In 'colds', the 'o' and 'd' sounds are clearly distinct. However, in 'roath', as 'o' and 'th' are different consonant sounds. Hence, they cannot be considered the same in terms of vowel sounds.</s>
gumm, herminie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

Justification: 
The words `gummi-herminie` and `gumm-herminie` both have the same root word, which is `gumm`. However, because of the silent `'i'` at the end of `gummi`, the pronunciation differs. Therefore, the vowel sounds are different, despite both words containing "m" after the silent 'hi' sound of "gummi."</s>
geitner, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "geitner" and "annex," contain two vowels and have very similar vowel sounds. It's just that the first two consonants are switched. "Geitner" starts with "G" and "A" and "Annex" starts with "N" and "A." Despite this change, their vowel sounds are the same, making them different only by the two initial consonants.</s>
kanai, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, kanai-gemme, do have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds.

The reasoning behind the classification is that the vowel sound in both words is the same (the sound /aː/). The difference in the consonant sounds, /k/ and /j/, changes the overall pronunciation of the words.</s>
gautney, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "gautney" and "nex" have the same vowel sounds (AO, AA, OW), which are "aou" in both, but "gautney" includes the consonant sounds "GAH" and "TAH," while "nex" has "NH" and "AH."</s>
sweetie, meany, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
horn's, hmong, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words contain identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words have the same vowel sound (e.g., "o" in "horn" and "hmong"). However, the consonant sounds are different: "h" in "horn" and "hm" in "hmong".</s>
misuse, renew, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical vowel sounds and different consonant sounds.

"Misuse" and "renew" do share similar consonant sounds initially (M and R), but they differ greatly in the vowels they contain. Vowels are the most significant part of words, as they give sounds to words. 

In "Misuse," the first vowel is the short 'i' sound, and in "Renew," the first vowel is the long 'a' sound. That makes one vowel different from the other, effectively distinguishing these two words.</s>
midpac, tristan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words - "midpac-tristan" - indeed have identical vowel sounds but different consonant sounds. Both words share the same vowel sounds - "i" in "mid," "e" in "pace," "i" in "tri," "a" in "mid" and "e" in "tri." However, the consonant sounds are different, with the first word having "-m-" at the start, while the second word has "-t-" instead. The differences in the consonant sounds make the two words distinct from each other despite having identical vowel sounds.</s>
wintry, lilli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words ["wintry", "lilli"] have identical vowel sounds ("ee" sound) but different consonant sounds. The consonant sounds of these two words, while being different, do not affect their vowel sound.</s>
