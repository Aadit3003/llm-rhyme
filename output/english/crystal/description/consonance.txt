In "aird," the 'a' is the vowel sound.
In "arid," the 'a' is a different vowel sound.

So although they share the same series of consonants, the vowel sounds are different, thus making the consonant sounds different as well.</s>
schuller, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in "schuller" and "kissling" are the same. They both have "sch" as their starting consonant. However, the vowel sounds are different: "schuller" has "er" at the end, while "kissling" has "ing". The distinction in vowel sounds makes these two words distinct linguistically.</s>

In the first word "lovitz", the vowel sound is written as 'z' while in the second word "elevates", the vowel sound is written as 's'. This difference prevents the two words from having identical vowel sounds.</s>
demeans, dominoes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "demeans" and "dominoes," do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Justification: The word structure of "demeans" consists of two consonant sounds followed by a vowel sound "mn".

In the word "sighed," the vowel sound is /aɪd/. In the word "petrilli," the vowel sound is /ɪtərɪli/. The consonant sounds, which are "s" and "t" in "sighed" and "petrilli," remain the same, but the vowel sounds in the two words have different lengths and nuances.</s>
leaps, lopes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "leaps" and "lopes" do indeed have the same consonant sounds (the consonant "l" makes the same sound in both words), but the vowel sounds are different: "leaps" starts with the vowel "i" (as in "pick"), while "lopes" starts with the vowel "o" (as in "boot"). Therefore, both words maintain the same consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds, which leads to them being considered distinct words with different meanings.</s>
lamaist, lemaster, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Look at the letters in each word, including the first letter: 

1. Lamaist: The first consonant is "L", and it matches the consonant in "lemaster". However, the vowel sound is different: "amaist" has the "a" sound, while "lemaster" has the "m" sound. So these two words have the same consonants but different vowel sounds.</s>
curlee, kahle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "curlee" and "kahle" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words share the consonant sounds 'k', 'h', 'l', and 'e'. However, the vowel sound in "curlee" is 'y' and in "kahle" the vowel is 'a'.</s>
day's, dyes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "day's" and "dye's" have the same initial consonant sound (both start with the "d" sound), but they have different vowel sounds. The first word, "day's", has either a long or diphthong vowel sound whereas the second word, "dye's", has a short vowel sound or schwa sound. Therefore, the consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds are different in these two words.</s>

sheley, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "sheley" and "reierson," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In both words, the consonant sounds are the same: S-, H-, and L- (pronounced short "eh" and schwa respectively). The only difference lies in the vowel sounds between the two words: Sheley has a long "e" sound ("ee-lay"), while Reierson has a short "i" sound ("rey-or-ner"). Therefore, these words have the same consonant sounds, but the unique vowel sounds differentiate them. The only commonality between them is that all the letters in the words have the same pronunciation in both words.</s>
tidy, tad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words share identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. Specifically, "tidy" has the vowel sound [i] and "tad" has the vowel sound [æ].</s>

torma, trimm, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "torma" and "trimm" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In both words, the vowels "o" and "a" differ in their sound, but the consonant letters "t" and "r" are the same. These words are homophones and are considered non-homographs because they share the same consonant pattern but change only one vowel sound.</s>
leclere, lukoil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both "leclere" and "lukoil," the identical consonant sounds are represented by the letters "l" and "k." However, the vowel sounds are different—"e" in "leclere" and "o" in "lukoil."</s>
gummi, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in these words are both identical. However, the vowel sounds are different - 'u' in 'gummi', 'a' in 'haggart'. Despite these differences, the consonant sounds remain the same, allowing these two words to be considered as having identical consonant sounds.</s>
scholer, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. First, let's break down the words for better understanding:

1. "Scholer" - The word "Scholer" has three distinct consonants: 'S', 'CH', 'L', and 'R'. Each of these consonants is represented in the word "Gautney." 

2. "Gautney" - "Gautney" also consists of three consonants 'G', 'A', and 'T', followed by an 'N' at the end. The vowel 'Y' in the second word is silent as indicated by the underline in "Gautney."

So, while the number of consonants and their order in both words are the same, the vowel sounds and structure are different. This means that the words "Scholer" and "Gautney" are not homophones (i.e., words that sound alike but have different meanings) but rather are homographs (i.e., words that have the same spelling and may convey somewhat related meanings).</s>
leakey, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words (leakey and jamb) have identical consonant sounds in the positions where the consonants are different, such as "l" and "b" in each. The vowel sounds in each word are different, with "e" in "leakey" and "a" in "jamb." However, for the purpose of analysis, we can combine these two separate words into one, "leakey-jamb." In this new word, the consonant sounds remain the same, while the vowel sounds change because they are no longer next to each other. The consonant sounds become "l, b, a, e, k, k, b, a, m," and the vowel sounds change to "a, e, a, k, k, b, a, m."</s>
hermon, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'hermon' and 'caen' both have identical consonant sounds in both words (h, m, n) but the vowel sounds are different (a in 'hermon' and a in 'caen'). Therefore, these words share some consonant sounds but have distinct vowel sounds, and they are not homophones.</s>
hyman, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "hyman" and "zele," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Hyman is pronounced as "hay-man," while "zele" is pronounced as "zay-lee." However, both words start with the same six consonants, and the only difference is the vowel sound that changes between the two words.</s>
flammer, flume, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds (flm-flm-m) but different vowel sounds. In "flammer," the "a" sound is pronounced as [æ], while in "flume," the "a" sound is pronounced as [ɔ].</s>
ashen, shein, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes. These words, "ashen" and "shein," do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only difference between the two words is the vowel sound at the beginning: "a" in "ashen" and "i" in "shein." 

In further analysis, you can notice that both consonants in both words form a consonant cluster, meaning one or more consonants are grouped together to form a single phoneme. The clusters in these words are /ʃ/ in both words, followed by a vowel. Thus, the underlying sounds remain similar, with only the vowel change creating differences in the pronunciation.</s>
cahn, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cahn" and "arseneault" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "cahn," the 'h' sound followed by 'c' and 'a' create the same consonant sounds in "arseneault." However, the words have different vowel sounds – "c" plus the vowel "a" in the first word, and "e" plus the vowel "u" in the second word.</s>
gertner, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word and phrases you have given have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This is because 'gertner-zele' contains only consonant sounds and does not include any actual alphabets/vowel sounds, whereas 'gertner' would have consonant sounds and specific vowel sounds (e.g., 'g', 'e', 'r', 't', 'n', 'e', 'r'), and 'zele' would contain its own consonant sounds and vowel sounds (e.g., 'z', 'e', 'l', 'e'). Hence, although both words look similar - composed of three lowercase consonants - they are distinct because they use different vowel sounds.</s>
tandy's, attends, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

"Tandy's" and "attends" both have "t" and "n" consonant sounds. The "a" vowel sound in "Tandy's" is longer and rounded, while the "a" vowel sound in "attends" is shorter and unrounded. The main difference, however, lies in the length of the "a" vowel sound, making the two words distinct but similar in sound.</s>
sims, semis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sims" and "semis" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In each word, the single consonant sound (/sim, sɛm/) remains unchanged, while the vowel sound (/ɪm, ɛm/) alters between i (sims) and e (semis) creating slight variations in the pronunciation.</s>
osler, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words 'osler' and 'prima' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word 'osler', the consonant sound is "s" and in 'prima', the consonant sound is "p". There is just a slight change in the vowel sound from "o" to "a" in the second word. The basic sounds of the consonants remain constant between the two words.</s>
elopes, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "elopes" and "lips" have identical consonant sounds (plosives: /p/, /l/, /t/, /p/, /s/) and different vowel sounds (/ɛlˌɒpi:/ in "elopes" and /ˌlɪps/ in "lips").</s>
scholer, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds (ch) but different vowel sounds. The word "scholar" has a sch sound before the l sound, while "jamb" has a d sound before the b sound. This difference in final vowel sounds produces the words' distinctive pronunciations.</s>
sunday's, sandos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This can be explained through breaking down the words into their individual phonemes – the smallest units of language that convey meaning:

1. Sunday: In "Sunday," the vowel sound is /a/: "sa-" is the beginning onset, which is commonly /b/, /d/ or /p/ in this case. The central vowel, or central coda, is also /a/: "nu-" in the word "Sunday." The /d/ sound at the end of the word represents the dental /t/ sound which is also present in "sandos." Therefore, both words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
treen, terrien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Treen" and "terrien" both consist of the consonant sounds /t/, /r/, /n/, and the vowel sounds /ɛ/ and /a/, respectively.</s>
necaise, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "necaise" (N-EH-K-EYEZ) and "brun" (B-R-YOO) have the same initial and medial consonant sounds, which are /n/ and /kw/, but they have different final consonants and vowel sounds - /i/ in "necaise" and /y/ in "brun". This results in very similar consonant sounds but different overall sounds.</s>
amado, murdaugh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both "amado" and "murdaugh" have identical consonant sounds (CVCVC), where "C" represents a consonant and "C" represents a consonant. However, the vowel sounds are different (a in "amado" and ae in "murdaugh").</s>
straker, stork, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "straker" and "stork," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They are homophones, which means they sound alike but have different meanings based on the vowel sound they are connected to. In "straker," the vowel sound is /a/, and in "stork," the vowel sound is /ɔːk/.</s>
suder, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "suder" and "encase" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Specifically, the only difference between the two words lies in their vowel sounds. In "suder," the vowel sound is /a/, while in "encase," the vowel sound is /e/. In both words, the consonant sounds are the same (/s/, /k/, /n/, /s/, /k/, /s/, /s/, /e/, /n/, /s/, /d/, /s/, /s/, /e/).</s>
kiene, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They have different consonant and vowel sounds, reflecting separate words.</s>
prom, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both words "prom-gemma" are identical. However, the vowel sounds differ, as "prom" has the sound "awm", while "gemma" has the sound "em". The "-" (hyphen) between "prom" and "gemma" serves as a phonetic break and is not considered part of the vowel or consonant sounds.</s>
summerlin, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'summerlin' and 'elcotel' have identical consonant sounds, but their vowel sounds are different. In 'summerlin', the first vowel sound is /aʊ/ and in 'elcotel', the first vowel sound is /æ/.</s>
egerton, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words have identical consonant sounds but differ significantly in vowel sounds. Specifically, the first word "egerton" has the "e" in "E-gerton" followed by "g" as a soft palatalised consonant, whereas the second word "kanne" has a more common "e" that is more like the sound in words like "get" or "bet". Despite these differences, the actual consonant sounds are the same in both words, which is why they are considered to be part of the same basic sound category.</s>
blotter, ability, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "blotter" and "ability" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Justification: 
Consider the consonant sounds within both words. "Blotter" has 'b', 'l', 't', and 'r'. "Ability" also has 'b', 'l', 't', and 'r.' However, the vowel sounds are different: "Blotter" has the vowel sounds 'a','l' and 'b', and "ability" has 'a', 'b', 'l', 'a', 'b', and 'l'. Despite having the same consonant sounds, the vowel sounds of these words differ, making them unique.</s>
butzer, bytes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words 'butzer' and 'bytes' both have the same set of consonant sounds, but they differ in their vowel sounds. 'Butzer' has the vowel sound 'a' in the word 'but', while 'bytes' has the vowel sound 'y' in the word 'byte'. Therefore, the consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds are different, resulting in two different words.</s>
haggart, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
pfohl, flour, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pfohl" and "flour" share the same first six consonants, specifically "p-f-h-o-l-". The only difference is the vowel sounds, with the first word ("pfohl") having "-ohl" and the second word ("flour") having "-our". These words may be misconstrued as identical in their consonant sounds due to the similar underlying structure, but the slight change in the vowel sounds differentiates them.</s>
prody, eppard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "prody-eppard," do not have different vowel sounds but display slightly different consonant sounds when separated. However, upon closer examination and pronunciation, it becomes clear that their consonant sounds are almost identical. The individual letters "p", "r", "o", "d", "i", "e", "p", and "r" hold identical consonant sounds no matter which of these words it belongs to, while the sound of the middle vowels in each word, "o" and "e", are unique to each word. Consequently, the word "prody-eppard" has similar consonant sounds but different vowel sounds when compared to "prodypappard."</s>
ward, weird, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two words you mentioned, "ward" and "weird," are examples of homophones in English. They have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The vowel sound in "ward" is /ɔːr/ and in "weird" it is /waɪəd/.

Homophones are words that sound alike but have different meanings and are often used as a deliberate pun. In this case, "ward" is a noun meaning a room or area in a hospital or asylum for the mentally ill, while "weird" can mean strange, odd, or uncanny and is often used in a more informal context.</s>
nunn, nanni, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
pfohl, fallaw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "pfohl" and "fallaw". The identical consonant sounds are "p", "f", and "l". The difference lies in the vowel sounds: in "pfohl", the vowel sound is "o" (as in "pool"), while in "fallaw", the vowel sound is "aw" (as in "hawk").</s>
schley, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schley" and "khanna" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonants are the same—"s," "c," "h," "l," "y"—while the vowels are different—"o" in "schley" and "a" in "khanna." However, both "schley" and "khanna" still have the same basic consonant sounds and contribute to the overall pattern of those sounds, which is why I still consider them to have identical consonant sounds.</s>
kin, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kin-smolen" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
acid, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "acid" and "highman" both have identical consonant sounds. 

In both words, the consonant sounds are "c," "x," "t," "h," and "n." However, the vowel sounds differ. In "acid," the vowel sound is /a/. In "highman," the vowel sound is /a/ before the consonant /h/. This difference makes the words phonologically distinct.</s>
ceder, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes
The words "ceder" and "zeoli" both have the same consonant sounds: /s/, /d/, /t/, and /r/. However, the similarity in consonants is disrupted by the difference in the vowel sounds: /i/ in "ceder" and /y/ in "zeoli."</s>
soeder, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "soeder-incase," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds within the words stay the same, while the vowel sounds at the beginning and end of the words differ. This is a common linguistic phenomenon. It means that the same consonant sounds are repeated in both words. But there are different vowel sounds involved, so these words are pronounced differently.</s>
lopes, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lopes" and "lips" share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. 

Specifically, the consonants in both words are: l, p, s. The only difference lies in the vowels: in "lopes," the vowel sound is 'o,' while in "lips," the vowel sound is 'i.' This is just another example of how words can sometimes have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
scholey, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scholey-hymen" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. When the vowels in these words are written as phonetic symbols, we can see that the vowels in each word represent the same sounds but are phonetically different and appear differently.</s>
schul, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schul-brion" contain identical consonant sounds: ș, ch, l, and r. The vowel sounds, however, are different. The first word, "schul-brion," has the vowels "u" and "o" as part of the original word spelling, while the second word has the vowels "i" and "o" through a Germanic influence in the spelling. Therefore, even though the consonant sounds are the same, they are not pronounced the same when the words are spoken in their original form.</s>
sterilizations, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "sterilizations," the letter "a" in the word "sterilizations" is pronounced as a long "a" like in "matter" while in the word "jimi," "a" is pronounced as a short "a" like in "hat". The consonant sounds are different (s vs. sh) and the vowel sounds are different (a in the first word versus the shorter sound a in the second word).</s>
keehan, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "keehan" and "baran" share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds.</s>
lindy, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lindy" and "olinde" in the given string "lindy-olinde" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
camel, kemler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds remain the same in both words, while the vowel sounds vary: camel has a "a" sound, and kemler has a "a" sound as well.</s>
cede, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "cede-nyx" have identical consonant sounds that make some of the words distinct from English phonetics. However, these words are not English words and lack standard vowel sounds. The word "cede" represents the act of surrendering, while "nyx" might refer to the Greek goddess of the night. Phonetically, there is a slight change in the vowel sounds when "nyx" precedes "cede."</s>
shirlee, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "shirlee" contains the sounds /ʃ/ and /i/, while "bran" contains the sounds /b/ and /ə/. In the first word, "shirlee," the "si" sound is different from the "bi" sound in the second word, "bran."</s>
seder, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gautney, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gautney" and "enix" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The main identification factor is the absence or presence of certain consonant sounds at the beginning or within the word. 

For example, the first consonant in "gautney" and "enix" is both pronounced as "g," but they have different vowel sounds: "a" in "gautney" and "i" in "enix." Other consonants, like "t" and "n" in "gautney" and "x" and "n" in "enix," add to the differentiation of the sounds.</s>
cuccio, kutch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cuccio-kutch" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the first word, "cuccio," the vowel sound is /kuːʃoʊ/ (kook-SHO), while in the second word, "kutch," the vowel sound is /kuːtʃ/ (kut-ch). Although they share the same consonant "k," the vowel sounds produce different sounds.</s>
schuele, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "schuele" and "gotten" have identical consonant sounds (specifically, "sch-" and "gt-") but they have different vowel sounds. "Schuele" has the vowel sound of the letter 'e' (/i/ approximately pronounced) and "gotten" has the vowel sound of the letter 'o' (/o/ approximately pronounced).</s>
kearny, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kearny" and "roesner" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds in both words are "k," "r," "t," and "n," while the vowel sounds differ between "i" and "e" in "kearny" and "o" in "roesner." Although the words are spelled similarly, they do not share a word family or derivation.</s>
hayton, huttner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds, /h/?t/?n/?r/. However, they have distinct vowel sounds: hayton has the vowel sound /j/?, while huttner has the vowel sound /?/.</s>
bonn's, bono's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are identical in "bonn's" and "bono's," but the two words have different vowel sounds: "onn" in "bonn's" and "oo" in "bono's." Even though the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds and thus the overall pronunciation of the words differ.</s>
garroz, gruis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have the same consonant sounds while having different vowel sounds. In the words "garroz" and "gruis," the only difference lies in the vowel sounds. "Garroz" has a 'a' sound in "ro," while "gruis" has a 'u' sound in "gru." The consonant sounds remain the same, making the words distinct from each other.</s>
gaetano, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds (CVCVC structure). 

The words 'gaetano' and 'ireson' share the first four letters ('gaet') which are identical in both words. In the words, "gaetano" and "ireson", the letters 'a', 'o', and the 'r' sound the same. Thus, the consonant sounds are the same. Although the vowel sounds are different, the first two vowels change and they do not affect the consonant sounds, because the consonant sounds in the word structure are only those found in the beginning of the word, not the vowels. Therefore, they have the same consonant sounds.</s>
tyree, tirey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tyree" and "tirey" do indeed have identical consonant sounds (both start with "t") but different vowel sounds: "ee" (diphthong) in "tyree" and "ay" (single vowel) in "tirey."</s>
herminie, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || The words "herminie" and "reierson" have identical consonant sounds. They share the same consonant pattern, which includes 5 consonant sounds: H (twice), R, I, E, S. However, their vowel sounds are different because "herminie" has an "a" sound at the beginning and an "i" sound in the middle, while "reierson" has a "y" sound and a diphthong ending (ai). Therefore the answer is "no" because the vowel sounds are not the same.</s>
ward, weirdo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
hun, hano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hunhano" and "hun-hano" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The difference lies in the vowel sounds. "hunhano" features two vowels, "u /ˈju/ (yoo)" (pronounced as 'oo' in "boot") and "a /oː/ (ah)". On the other hand, "hun-hano" only has one vowel, "u /u/ (yoo)" (pronounced as 'oo' in 'boot'). Despite the vowel differences, the consonant sounds in both words are identical.</s>
liebe, laborer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "liebe-laborer" contain identically arranged consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. In English, we do not have the vowel y in words like "liebe" and "laborer." The y remains silent, whereas in "laborer," y remains and is pronounced.</s>
sant, sent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "sant" and "sent" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. However, they both share the same consonants (/s/, /a/, /n/, /t/, /n/, /s/, /t/). The only difference between them lies in the vowel sounds, where "sant" has /a/ and "sent" has /ɛ/.</s>
licker, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "licker" and the word "jama" have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. While "licker" has an /ɪ/ sound, the word "jama" pronounces vowels as /a/ (both long and short forms). These differences create unique phonetic variations between the two words.</s>
knicks', summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the spelling "knicks'-summerlin," the word "knicks" has two vowels (a) which is being repeated as (summerlin). Hence, both are not identical but have similar consonant sounds with the k and n sound. 

In summary, the two words share the same consonant sounds but the vowel sounds differ. This is why it can be said they have different vocalic expressions, although their pronunciation differs with the repetition of a specific vowel only.</s>
afloat, follette, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
gautney, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Justification:

In the word "gautney", the consonant sequence "gvtn" is identical in both words. However, the vowel sounds are different. "Gautney" has a /ʌ/ vowel sound in the first syllable, while "kanner" has a /ɑː/ vowel sound in the last syllable. So, while the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds are different and this makes the words distinct.</s>
arseneau, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
rayson, rosano, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The first word, "rayson," has the consonant sounds "r" -> "r" -> "s" -> "n." The vowel sounds in this word are "ee" -> "uh" -> "uh" -> "ay." 

The second word, "rosano," has the consonant sounds "r" -> "h" -> "o" -> "s" -> "a" -> "n" -> "o." The vowel sounds in this word are "ee" -> "uh" -> "eh" -> "ay" -> "ih" -> "oo" -> "ay." 

Although both words start with the letter "r," they have different consonant sounds in positions 2, 4, and 5 and different vowel sounds throughout the word (changes in "uh" and "ay").</s>
colors, kleis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both "colors" and "kleis" have /k/ and /l/ as their consonant sounds. However, the vowel sounds are different, with "colors" containing /o/: /k/ + /o/ + /l/ + /o/ + /rs/, and "kleis" containing /i/: /k/ + /i/ + /l/ + /i/ + /s/.</s>
shill, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two given words, "shill" and "ozelle," share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds.

The letter pair "sh" sound is the same in both words and is a bilabial nasal consonant sound. However, the vowel sound in "shill" corresponds to the close front unrounded vowel /ɛ/ (English /l/) and the vowel sound in "ozelle" corresponds to the open front unrounded vowel /o/. Despite these differences in their vowel sounds, the identical consonant sounds ensure that the two words do not have the same phonetic value.</s>
multiprocessor, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

These words, "multiprocessor" and "ireson", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The main difference lies in the pronunciation of the letters, "o" and "r", which are central to the distinction between the two words. In "multiprocessor," the "o" is pronounced as "oh" (oʊ), forming the word "frozen"; whereas, in "ireson," the "o" is pronounced as "oh" (oh) and the "r" is silent (not pronounced), as in the word "frozen." Nonetheless, the consonants in both words are identical (multipr-, pr-) and the same consonant clusters remain the same.</s>
shaul, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "shaul" and "jaimie" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
alcoa's, multiprocessor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "alcoa's" and "multiprocessor" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are "al," "co," "e," and "ch," while the vowel sounds are "a" in alcoa's, and "o" in multiprocessor.</s>

schaal, gomer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
saad, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "saad" and "germer" do have identical consonant sounds because they both start with the sequence "saa," and end with the sequence "r," but the vowel sounds are different. In "saad," the first vowel is a long ā (ā) sound, while in "germer," the first vowel is a short ā (a) sound. Thus, they differ in terms of the vowel sounds they produce.</s>
paonessa, ponce, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "paonessa" and "ponce" share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. However, both words are phonetic variations of the same word "pona" (/pɒnə/), which represents the sound /pɒnə/ that is the most common pronunciation for the Spanish word "pongo." The addition of the extra 'a' in "paonessa" or the absence of the first 'a' in "ponce" changes the vowel sound and the stressed syllable in each word. This change results in a different pronunciation, even though the consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
schul, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schul-jaimie" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "schul," the vowel sound is short 'i' (as in "bit"), while in "jaimie," the vowel sound is long 'ee' (as in "meet"). These differences in vowel sounds make the words distinct from each other, but the consonant sounds are the same.</s>
kissling, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No. These words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Here's a brief analysis for both words:

1. "kissling":
- K (same consonant in both words)
- I (different vowel sound in "kissling")
- S (same consonant in both words)
- L (same consonant in both words)
- I (different vowel sound in "kissling") (note: different than the I in "elcotel")
- I (same consonant in both words)
- N (same consonant in both words)

2. "elcotel":
- E (same consonant in both words)
- L (same consonant in both words)
- C (same consonant in both words)
- O (same consonant in both words)
- T (same consonant in both words)
- E (same consonant in both words)
- L (same consonant in both words)

There are two unique vowel sounds, one in each word. This means the consonant sounds are not identical in both words. Additionally, "elcotel" does not end with a 't' sound like "kissling," but rather the 'l' sound. Thus, there might be other distinctions in pronunciation too.</s>
aside, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aside" and "incase" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "aside," the vowel sound is the schwa sound (ə). In "incase," the vowel sound is the long vowel sound (/i:/).</s>
colors, klose, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The words "colors" and "klose" both have 'cl' sounding consonants in the middle ('or', 'res'). However, the vowel sounds are different: 'colors' has 'ee' sound, and 'klose' has 'oo' sound in the vowel combination 'o' and 'e'.</s>
heyman, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "heyman" and "bruner" both consist of the identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. The identities of the consonants are - h, e, y, a, m, n -, and for each of these, they're the same in both words. The difference appears to be between the vowel sounds - the difference occurs between 'e' in 'heyman' and 'a' in 'bruner'. So, I'd say this is a case of homophones, where two different words sound the same except for the vowel sound – 'ay' and 'ye' in 'heyman', and 'a' and 'o' respectively in 'bruner'.</s>
keehner, aken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
ocon, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are the same in the words "ocon-brun" and "octopus" (o, k, k, b). However, the vowel sounds are different, as "o" is not present in "octopus." That is why the words are not identical in terms of their entire sound.</s>
haggart, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sawdey, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The two words "sawdey" and "elcotel" both consist of the same consonant sounds [s], [d], [j], [s], [j], [k], [t] and [l]. However, the vowel sounds in the two words are different, with "sawdey" having the vowel sounds [o] and [d] while "elcotel" has [ɛ] and [o].</s>
kut, keto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "kut-keto", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are 'k', '-t', '-t', '-' and '-'. The vowel sounds in each word are '-' and '-o'. 

Kut-keto contains homophones (words with the same pronunciation) with different meanings. In the context of these two words, they convey two different concepts. Kut refers to an undecided or unsettled situation, while Keto refers to the state of being on a ketogenic diet. Thus, while they share the same consonant sounds, the difference in the vowel sounds creates a contrast in their meanings.</s>
scarry, sukru, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

The given words "scarry" and "sukru" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In each pair of consonant sounds, the vowel sound is different. For example:

1. In "scarry," the "s" and "r" sounds have the same consonant sound, but they are pronounced with two different vowels: /s/ and /r/ in "scarry" vs. /s/ and /r/ in "sukru".
2. Similarly, in "scarry," the "a" is a schwa vowel (/ə/), while in "sukru," it is a fully pronounced /a/ vowel.

In general, the consonants and vowels in "scarry" and "sukru" are different, so the answer to the question is "No".</s>
tomatoe, timeout, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided have the same consonant sounds, i.e., "t m t", but have different vowel sounds. 

The first word, "tomatoe", has a long vowel sound (EH1), while the second word, "timeout", has a short vowel sound (IH1) in the first letter (o). However, the underlying consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
fires, fuzz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both words are the same - the hard 's' in 'fires' and the 's' in 'fuzz' both sound like the English 's.' However, the vowel sounds in the two words differ: the 'ee' in 'fires' and the 'oo' in 'fuzz' sound different because they are composed of different vowels.</s>
moody's, murders, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These words do not have identical consonant sounds, as they are distinct vocabulary items. "moody's" refers to the credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service, while "murders" refers to a person or group who commit murder. The words are not pronounced the same way and have different meaning.</s>
lockers, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "lockers" ends in a voiced alveolar fricative /l/, while the word "zele" also ends in a voiced alveolar fricative /l/ but it's pronounced with a raised intonation on the preceding syllable (e.g., like 'leh' instead of 'le').</s>
ivory, yves, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "ivory" and "yves," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This creates two words with the same consonant sounds but different phonetics.</s>
connor, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "connor" and "primo," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Specifically, the words have the same set of consonant sounds represented by the letter "n" or "r" in both words, while the vowel sounds are different. In "connor," the vowel sound is an "o" sound, while in "primo," the vowel sound is a "u" sound. Despite these differences, the phonetic patterns represented by the consonant sounds are identical, as indicated by the letters "n" and "r" in both words.</s>
homan, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are: "h," "m," "-n," "-n," "t," "r," "g," "t." The vowel sounds are: "i" in "o," "a" in "ma," "i" in "a," "a" in "ert," "e" in "her." The words are homophones and sound the same, but their meanings are different.</s>
gotten, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gotten" and "bran" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, "gotten" has a "g" sound at the beginning, followed by an "uh" sound for the rest of the word, while "bran" starts off with a "b" sound and has a "r" sound. The difference lies primarily in the vowel sounds, making these words distinct from each other despite their similar consonant combinations.</s>
petralia, homeowner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
curtis', cates, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They have different consonant sounds as well: 

1. "curtis'-cates" has two different consonants, "ts" and "sh," in different positions.
2. In the word "curtis'-cates," the vowels are also different. The "a" in "curtis'" is a long vowel sound and the "a" in "cates" is a short vowel sound.

When compared to each other, the consonant sounds and vowel sounds are not the same in each word.</s>
souder, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "souder" and "primo" both have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The word "souder" has the following sequence of consonants: s, o, u, d, and r. The consonants are pronounced independently of each other, resulting in a distinct series of sounds.

The word "primo", on the other hand, also has the sequence: p, r, i, m, and o. Again, the consonants are pronounced separately, but the resulting sounds are similar due to shared consonant sounds.

However, the vowels in each word are different, as "u" in "souder" changes to "i" in "primo", while the rest of the consonants in the sounds remain the same. Therefore, these two words share the same consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds, which is what makes them identitical in this context.</s>
shelly, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelly" and "highman" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In both words, you can hear the following identical consonant sounds: "sh" and "gh". The consonant "sh" is the same in "shelly" and "highman." Similarly, "gh" is present in "highman."

However, the vowel sounds differ in both words. In "shelly," the vowel sound starts with a short "i" sound. In contrast, "highman" begins with a long "a" sound. In addition, the other vowel sounds in "shelly" (e.g., "le" vs. "ye") are different from those in "highman" (e.g., "man" vs. "men").</s>
comly, kemler, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Justification:
- The first word "comly" has consonant sounds [k] and [m]. The letter 'c' is doubled giving a clear consonant sound when pronounced individually. In addition, the letter 'l' is pronounced as [l].
- The second word "kemler" also has consonant sounds [k], [m], and [l]. The pronunciation is [k] [ɛm], [ɛr]. Note that the letter 'c' is spoken as [k] while the doubled 'c' in "comly" is pronounced as ['k] [m].

To summarize, the consonant sounds in the two words are not identical, but they do share some sounding features. The primary difference lies in their vowel sounds.</s>
shiels, shirley's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "shiels" and "shirley's" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds in both words are the same: "sh."

next, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The given words are "next-germe" and "pencil". The consonant sounds in both words are the same. The only difference lies in the vowel sounds. In "next-germe," the pronunciation of the 'e' sound in the middle (between 'g' and 'm') resembles more to the I-sound, whereas in "pencil," the same vowel sound is pronounced closer to the E-sound. This difference in pronunciation separates them, while the consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
nyx, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nyx" and "locatelli" both have identical consonant sounds in the word "nyx". However, the vowel sounds are different, as "nyx" is pronounced as a single syllable, [niz] or [nyks], while "locatelli" is usually pronounced [lɒkətɛli], with the vowel sound changing to [æ].</s>

kissling, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words do not have identical consonant sounds since they have different consonants at the beginning (k in 'kissling' and n in 'next'). However, they do have the same sequence of consonants in the middle, so the similarity in consonant sounds is more of a coincidence rather than an intended pattern or meaning.</s>
ybanez, baynes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ybanez" and "baynes" share the same consonant sounds. "Ybanez" consists of "y" (pronounced like 'y' in 'yes'), "b" (like 'b' in 'bad'), "a" (like 'a' in 'at'), "n" (like 'n' in 'not'), and "z" (like 'z' in 'zip').

The consonants are represented by S, U, D, G, and the corresponding vowel sound is represented by E. Despite the similar consonant sounds, pronunciation between those two words deviates as 'U' and 'U' are the two different pronunciations for the vowel in 'sued' and 'game' in their respective positions, creating different vowel sound combinations. Therefore, they are not exactly the same, but the repetition of consonant sounds forms a common idea linking the two expressions. In this context the answer must be Yes, these words do indeed have identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds.</s>

The consonant sounds are the letters 'k', 'n', 'b', and 'r' in both words. However, the vowels in "knacks" are 'a', 'n', 'k', and 's', and the vowels in "breon" are 'a', 'r', 'b', and 'n'.</s>
hany, hano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "hany" and "hano," are examples of words that have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In Hany, the initial "h" and the following "vowel sound" (whose sound in English is not clear but would correspond to the letter 'a' or 'e', in fact a high nasal sound.)

In Hano, the sound comes from "h" followed by "n" and then the vowel sound "o" which correspond to the English words "han" and "o". 

However, it is important to note that the words are both made up of the letter 'h' and two identical consonant sounds which creates a homophone effect i.e., they sound the same while spelled differently. But when considering vowel sounds, which differ between the two words, they have different meanings.

So the two words have similar sounds but different meanings and vowel sounds. It is also true of English words where similar consonant sounds can create homophones but are generally different by vowel sounds.</s>
schlee, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "schlee-kanner" and "shleekanner" do have identical consonant sounds. In each word, the only difference is the vowel sound, with the first word having a schlish sound (i.e., shlee-kanner) and the second word having a schlish sound (i.e., shleekanner). The common part in these words is the -schlee- sound, which consists of two separate consonant sounds - "sch" and "leek."</s>

The vowel sounds are: 

1. a (lowered vocal cords)
2. erm (varying the shape of the mouth, producing a different consonant sound)

While both words contain an "a" and an "erm" sound, they do not have identical consonant sounds as the second part of the word changes significantly when pronounced.</s>
coody, kid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "coody" and "kid" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They both start with the same consonant "k" and have other consonants that follow the same pattern.

Cowen: /ˈkuːən/ 
Bruney: /ˈbruːni/ 

The vowel sounds between the words are different. Cowen's vowel sound is an /u/, while Bruney's vowel sound is an /ə/. Thus, these words don't share identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
of, eave, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "of-eave" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In phonetics, this is called homophony, where words with different vowel sounds still sound the same. In this case, "of-eave" have the consonant sounds /f/, /v/, /v/, /v/, /v/, /v/, /v/, /v/, which are identical for both words, and different vowel sounds /i/ and /ɛ/. Since the consonant sounds are the same, they can still be considered homophones.</s>
saudi, oelkers, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Do these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds? saudi-oelkers

No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds. In "saudi-oelkers," the vowels (a, u, i) are identical between the two words, while the consonants are different. The first word has the same consonants as the second but with different vowel sounds.</s>

gumm, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
fleurette, flutter, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

The words "fleurette" and "flutter" do not have identical consonant sounds, they both have the same set of consonant sounds in their first syllables, but they are different in their vowel sounds. Therefore, they don't have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The English words must have different consonant sounds and vowel sounds to be considered distinct words.</s>
oslo, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Justification:
In the words "oslo" and "bryna", the identical consonant sounds are present at the beginning of both words. The only difference in the vowel sounds between the two words is the vowel at the end, "o" in "oslo" and "ee" (e written before an ee-sound) in "bryna". While the vowel sound "ee" in "bryna" is pronounced differently, it still carries the same set of consonant sounds that are identical in both words. Therefore, they have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
zil, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the answer is Yes.

Both words "zil-ozelle" have the same basic structure, composed of three segments: the silent letter "l" (aliteration), a group of consonant sounds, and the word "le" which indicates a noun. However, the words have distinct vowel sounds.

Consonant Sounds:
The first word, "zil", starts with a hard palatalized sound "zh", and finishes with the voiced velar fricative "l". The second word, "ozelle", starts with the voiced bilabial click "t" followed by the voiceless velar stop "kk". The two words are thus distinguished by their different vowel sounds since "zil" ends in "z" and "le" while "ozelle" has a "u" vowel instead of a "le".</s>
schul, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "schul-rosene," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Justification:
- Both "schul-" and "rosene" start with the same consonant, "s."
- In "rosene," the first vowel is a long, diphthong-like sound made by combining two vowels: a (short) + u (long). This creates a "oo" sound, like the vowel in "good."
- In "schul," the first vowel is a short, unstressed "u" sound.
- In both words, the final vowel is "e."</s>

kenn, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kenn-jaimie" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, the only change lies in the vowels of the words. 'Kenn' and 'jaimie' are just different ways of sayings the same syllable, with only the vowels changing. Hence, they are homophones. This phenomenon occurs frequently in English language when two or more words have same consonant sounds but different vowels thereby making them homophones.</s>
kenn, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words kenn-germer have the same consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. This is due to the fact that the second word, germer, has vowels (g: and m: ) whereas the first word, kenn, only has consonants.</s>
platz, palazzi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "platz," the consonant sounds are "p," "l," and "z."

Thus, both of them share the same consonant sounds.</s>
amyloid, imelda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "amyloid-imelda" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only consonants that remain the same are "m" (voiced bilabial plosive) which begins "imelda". All other letters or groups of letters in each word change; "Y" (voiced alveolar fricative) changes to "I" (back unrounded vowel) in the first word, and conversely, between "m" and "e" in the second word, causing "a" to be replaced by "e". This difference in vowel sounds, specifically, "a" and "e" can be found throughout each word. Hence, there are identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds in "Amyloid-imelda".</s>
schuler, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuler-necaise" both have identical consonant sounds and only differ in their vowel sounds. Here's the list of identical consonant sounds: In English, the words "ch" and "j" are similar consonant sounds, which is present in the word pair "schuler" and "necaise". The difference in vowel sounds comes from the position of the vowel in the words. In "schuler", the vowel is a schwa ('ə'), while in "necaise", the vowel is a short long 'i'.</s>
osler, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both "osler" and "ozelle" are the same, but the vowel sounds are different (e in "osler" is pronounced as u in "ozelle"). The words have phonetically similar but pronounced differently due to the change in vowel sounds.</s>

sowed, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
amadea, murdaugh, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "amadea" and "murdaugh", the vowel sounds are different. In "amadea", the vowel sound is [a], which is a common vowel sound in English. In "murdaugh", the vowel sound is [a] too, but in a different pronunciation. This means the vowel sounds are not the same and the words are not identical in this aspect. However, the consonant sounds are the same: "m" in both words, which contributes to the reason you mentioned in your question. But this comparison misses the fact that the vowel sounds are not consistent between the two words.</s>
sidey, schlee, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned, "sidey-schlee," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the first word, "sidey," the vowel sound is "ē" (short e); while, in the second word, "schlee," the vowel sound is "ī" (long i). Although the consonants remain the same, the vowel sounds are different.</s>

3. A (same in both words)
4. R (same in 'kearny' and 'n', but new letter 'm' in 'jamb' after the 'n')
5. N (same in both words)

The vowel sounds are different:

1. The vowel in "kearny" is the short 'a' sound (similar to 'bat')
2. The vowel in "jamb" is the short 'i' sound (similar to 'bit')

The two words share their initial consonant sounds; however, the vowel sounds are different due to the silent 'j' in 'jamb.'</s>
saudi, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

"Saudi" and "Khanna" share the following identical consonant sounds: "s" and "k". Each of these words also has a unique vowel sound: "a" in "saudi" and "u" in "khanna." Therefore, the primary differences between these words lie in their distinct vowel sounds.</s>
imes, mays', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gahm, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gahm" and "breighner" have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

wildes, world's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words "wildes" and "wildest" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In "wildes," the vowel sound is [i], while in "wildest," the vowel sound is [ɪ]. Although both have the same consonant sounds ([w] in this case), the way the vowels are pronounced is different. Therefore, these words are not pronounced exactly alike, even though they have the same consonant sounds.</s>
quito, ector, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No. 

The words "quito" and "ector" do indeed have identical consonant sounds because the consonant sounds in both words are the same (the 'k' or 'kh', the 't', 's', and 'ch' sounds). However, the vowel sounds are different: the "i" in "quito" is pronounced as an "ee" sound (as in "team"), while the "i" in "ector" is pronounced as an "eye" sound (as in "dye"). These differences in vowel sounds make the words have different pronunciations and thus cannot be considered having identical consonant sounds.</s>
gotten, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

heman, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "heman" and "premo," may seem to have different vowel sounds at first: h(ɛm) vs p(ɛrm) and e vs ɛ. However, upon closer examination, both vowels (hɛm and ɛrm) are represented with a single vowel sound, which is the schwa sound (ə). Therefore, although these words have different vowel sounds at first glance, their vowels are in fact represented by the same sound and can be considered to have identical consonant sounds.</s>
kut, actor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "kut-actor" have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The consonants are all pronounced the same in both words. The only difference lies in the vowels, which are "u" in "kut" and "a" in "actor."</s>

knocked, ancheta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "knocked-ancheta," has two different consonants sounds: "k" and "t". The second word, "knocked-anchet," also involves identical consonant sounds: "k" and "t." However, both vowel sounds in "knocked-anchet" are the same, differing from "knocked-ancheta" where the vowel sound "a" is replaced with "e."</s>
contusion, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words 'contusion' and 'zil' have the same consonant sounds, but they are spelled the same, but they have different vowel sounds, therefore, the words have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
gahm, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you have mentioned, "gahm-knicks'", do indeed have identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. In this case, the vowel sounds differ in the first syllable 'gahm' and the second syllable 'knicks'. The word 'gahm' has the vowel sound "a", while the word 'knicks' uses the vowel sound "i" in its first syllable. So, although the consonants are identical, their corresponding vowel sounds are different.</s>
anania, gnann, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "anania," the consonants "n" and "a" both have distinct sounds, whereas in "gnann," the "n" is the same, but the vowel sound of "a" is different from "anania."</s>

boys', baez, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words do not have identical consonant sounds since the final consonant 'z' in "boys" is different from the final consonant 'x' in "baez". However, both words do share some common consonant sounds, such as the 's' in both 'boys' and 'boys-baez' and the 'b' in 'boys-baez'. Additionally, the prefix 'boys-' suggests a connection or similarity with the word 'boys', indicating that there is some overlap in consonant sounds between the two words.</s>
ayerst, erased, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes
The two words, "ayerst" and "erased", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This is because when you remove the vowels from one word, the consonant sounds remain the same, but without the vowel sounds, they create two different words.</s>
tyree, terre, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "tyree," the first two letters 'ty' have identical consonant sounds ("ch" in "church" or "d" in "dog"), but the vowel sound is different ("ee" in "see"). In the word "terre," the first two letters 'tr' have different consonant sounds ("th" in "thin" or "tr" in "tree"), but the vowel sound is identical ("ee" in "see").</s>
side, postdating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "side-postdating" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only vowel sound that changes between the two words is the long 'a' in "side" vs the short 'e' in "postdating." The consonant sounds of "side" and "postdating" are similar- both are /s, ð, i, i, ð, a, t, ɪ, ŋ/.</s>
hun, o'hern, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words have the same consonant sounds as 'hun-o-hern', but the vowel sounds are different – 'hun' (long 'u' sound) in the first word and 'o' (short 'o' sound) in the second word.

maids', meadows, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "maids'-meadows" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words have a '-' character between 'maids' and 'meadows', which doesn't form a vowel sound but provides a pause or a specific location, in this case, between the words.</s>
immel, mealy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both 'immel' and 'mealy' have identical consonant sounds (IPA: /ɛm/), represented by 'm' in both words. However, the vowel sounds in each word are different. 'immel' has the vowel sound [ɪ], represented by the letter 'i', while 'mealy' has the vowel sound [eɪ], represented by the letters ['e'] and ['a'] together. Despite this difference in vowel sounds, all three letters (m, i, a) are still in the same location in both words, making them homophones.</s>
leaders, lads, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "leaders" and "lads" almost have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are "l", "e", "a", and "r", and "l", "a", and "d".

locally, leclere, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words have distinct consonant sounds as well as vowel sounds.

- "locally" has the consonant sounds /l/, /ɔ/, /k/, /ɑ/, /l/, and /i/, while "leclere" has the consonant sounds /l/, /ɛ/, /k/, /l/, /ɛ/, /r/, and /ɛ/. Thus, they are not the same because the consonant sounds are different. Moreover, the vowel sounds are also distinct: "locally" has /ɔ/, /k/, and /i/, while "leclere" has /ɛ/, /k/, and /ɛ/. Additionally, note that in most phonetic transcriptions, the symbol `-` is used to represent a silent consonant or as a way to show that the consonant sound is the same in both words.</s>
shelly, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are the same in both words, "shelly" and "zeal", but they differ in the vowel sounds: "shel" in "shelly" and "z" in "zeal". These words share a certain common ground in letter arrangement, but they are still distinct.</s>
cannery, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cannery" and "brion" have the same consonant sounds, but they are pronounced with different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are: B, R, I, and N. The vowel sounds differ in each word: A in 'cannery' and O in 'brion'. This difference arises because the position of the vowels, as well as the tonal value, can significantly change the phonetic transcription of the pronunciation.</s>
eckerd, cod, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word pair "eckerd" and "cod" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "eckerd," the vowel sound is /ɪ/ (eck), and in "cod," the vowel sound is /ɒ/ (oh). These two words share the same consonant sounds (/k/ and /r/) but differ in their vowel sounds.</s>
shill, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Explanation:
'Shill' and 'gotten' both share the consonant sounds [ʃ, g, ʔ, t, n] - 'sh' followed by the voiceless th sound [θ], then a 'g', a schwa (no sound) indicated by an apostrophe (the absence of 'a'), 't', and 'n' respectively. The difference lies in the vowel sounds. In 'shill', the vowel sound is [ɪ] while in 'gotten', the vowel sound is [ʌ]. 'Shill' has an 'i' vowel sound, as in 'kiss', while 'gotten' has a 'u' vowel sound, as in 'put'.</s>
courtesy, cates, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "courtesy-cates" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They do have some similar sounds, but their vowels and consonants are distinct in each word.</s>
ketch, cuccio, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "ketch" and "cuccio," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The first word "ketch" shares the same consonant sounds across its entire length, which includes one k, three ch, and two t sounds, but it ends with no vowel sounds. This would typically be pronounced as "kech-t".

The word "cuccio", also spelled using only "c" letter, also carries a consonant sequence identical to "ketch". The vowel sound, it seems, is a different matter. This word could be variously translated as having "k", "ch", "ch" and "c" or "kh" and "ch". This final "c" sound is often rendered as "ks" in English when pronounced.

Bear in mind that the vowel sound is the way it is because of diacritics on "k" and "c" which indicates it's more of a "ch" sound. If these diacritics were omitted, both words would likely appear identical except for the final consonant sound, as both end with a "c" sound (even if interpreted in different ways).</s>
platz, pilots, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "platz" and "pilots" have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. In "platz," the vowel sound of the "a" is short and rolled off at the end. In "pilots," the vowel sound of the "o" in "ots" is long and has a greater amount of rounding.</s>

The "o" and "y" in "loynd" are lower in pitch than the "y" and "y" in "lundy," but they still share the same vowel sound.</s>
peko, poky, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The first word, "peko," has the consonant sound of "p," and the second word, "poky," has the consonant sound of "p" as well. However, their vowel sounds are different. While "peko" has a "k" sound at the end, "poky" has a "y" sound at the end.</s>

faz, fuzz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "fazz" and "fuzz" have nearly identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. The key difference comes from the vowel sound in each word, which is 'ee' in "fazz" and 'oo' in "fuzz." Although these two words are spelled quite differently, they share similar consonant sounds as a result of the consonants being clustered together without a vowel in between in both cases.</s>
saudi, goyim, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, "saudi-goyim" does not have identical consonant sounds for all occurrences. The word "saudi" does not have identical consonant sounds, as "s" and "k" are distinct consonants with different pronunciations. Similarly, "g" and "k" also have different sounds. Here is how you can say the consonants of "goyim": "g", "w", "y", "m". All these letters have different consonant sounds. The only similarity of some consonants is "s" and "r" or "h" and "k".

schuler, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuler" and "jimi" both have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The first word has the vowel sound /u:/ in the syllable /ku:/ and the second word has the vowel sound /y:/ in the syllable /yim/. Although they share the same consonant sounds, the vowel sounds create a difference between the two words.</s>
pritz, pirouettes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pritz" and "pirouettes" have the same consonant sounds (p, r, i, t, z, et) in the beginning and middle of the word, but different vowel sounds. The first word "pritz" starts with "p" followed by the vowel sound "I" and ending with "z" whereas the second word "pirouettes" starts with "p" followed by the vowel sound "I" in the second part as well, but it ends with the vowel sound "u" instead.</s>
hun, hany, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sowder, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
tor, touro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "tor-touro," have identical consonant sounds because all the consonant sounds in the words are the same except for the difference in vowel sounds, which makes them distinct.

The vowel sound in "tor" is /ɔ/ or /o/, while in "touro" it is /u/ or /o/. Despite the different vowel sounds, the vowels in both words still fall under two separate sounds, because they are transcribed to different IPA symbols. Therefore, they count as different words and, overall, the words "tor-touro" aren't considered homophones because they have different consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
agne, eagen, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the given words "agne-eagen", each consonant sound is identical in both words. However, the vowel sounds are different, with "e" in "eagen" being the only vowel sound shared between the two words.</s>

gitano, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
zalay, zil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

In the English language, the words "zalay" and "zil" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words differ only in their vowels, with "zalay" pronounced /zəˈleɪ/ and "zil" pronounced /zɪl/.</s>

meadows, murders, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word pair "meadows" and "murders" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

When it comes to vowel sounds, the first word, "meadows" has a /ə/ sound in the middle and a /i:/ sound in the ending while the second one, "murders" has a /m/ sound in the first syllable and a /ər/ sound at the end. Although the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds are different, resulting in the words not being considered to have identical sounds. However, for educational purposes or for someone learning English, they can be used to practice correct pronunciation.</s>
sowata, esty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sowata-esty" have identical consonant sounds because both words have the letters 's', 'o', and 'w'. The only difference is that the first word, "sowata", has the vowel sound 'a', and the second word, "esty", has the vowel sound 'e'.</s>
depaolo, oedipal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, my friend. The words "depaolo" and "oedipal" both share the same consonant sounds but differ in their vowel sounds. Specifically, in "depaolo" the vowel sound is 'a', while in "oedipal" the vowel sound is 'i'.</s>
he, hah, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "he-hah" have identical consonant sounds (the letter 'h') but different vowel sounds (the letter "e" and "a").</s>
kapuscinski, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "kapustchinksi" and "roesner" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They have different vowel sounds, but also contain different consonant sounds, which are not identical.</s>
sidey, zulu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word you provided, "sidey-zulu", consists of two homophones (words that have the same spelling but different meanings and sounds). Here's justification for the yes answer:

The two words in the phrase are "sidey" and "zulu".

1. "Sidey": This word refers to a person who has a "wry and sarcastic sense of humor", or someone who jokes in a cynical or sardonic manner. This word is spelled identically to another word "sydney", with the same three consonant sounds. However, they are homophones as the vowel sounds (i.e., /aɪ/ in "sidey" vs. /iːdʒ/ in "sydney") are different.

2. "Zulu": This word is a reference to the Zulu people of South Africa, known for their distinct language and culture. The vowel sound in "zulu" is significantly different from that of "sidey" - it is pronounced as /zʊlu/ vs. /sidej/:

 a. In "zulu", the first 'u' is pronounced as /u/, similar to the vowel in "fun".
 b. The second 'u' in "zulu" is pronounced as /lu/, similar to the vowel in "love".

Therefore, despite their initial resemblance in spelling, and consonant sounds (which are identical), these two words are different in terms of vowel sounds. This justifies that
hah, howey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the words "hah-howey," the consonant sounds remain the same in both words while the vowel sounds differ only in the change of the last letter (a to o in "hah" and u to w in "howey"). Thus, the consonant sounds remain the same, while the vowel sounds are different enough to constitute different words when spoken out loud.</s>
hamner, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in both words (hammer and Jimi) are indeed the same. However, the vowel sounds, 'a' in hamner and 'i' in Jimi, are different.</s>
rossin, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
heisler, houseal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "heisler" and "houseal" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both have the same consonant sounds but different vowels. 

Words such as "heisler" and "houseal" are known as homophones, as they have the same pronunciation in various parts of the word but different meanings. Here, "heisler" refers to a type of coin that was created in Germany between the 1920s and 1940s, while "houseal" is a surname and is a blend of the words "house" and "solar."</s>
cally, kiehl, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the word "cally," there is a single vowel sound (long "A"). In "kiehl," the vowel sound is diphthongized in the word (formed by combining two vowels: "ee" and "ohl" as in "tie" and "love," respectively). There are no consonant sounds in common between the two words, as "cally" contains only one consonant sound and "kiehl" combines two distinct consonant sounds - "K" and "L." Therefore, the consonant sounds differ between these two words.</s>
dolley, dehler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dolley" and "dehler" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They both contain the consonants "d," "l," and "e" in a different order and one has a "y" at the start, while the other begins with a "y" that has been softened to a "z" sound or a different vowel sound in some cases.</s>
sinatra, santoro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two given words, "sinatra" and "santoro," have identical consonant sounds but differ in their vowel sounds.</s>
misspelled, misapplied, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "misspelled" and "misapplied" have identical consonant sounds, as they share all of the same consonant letters, except for the vowel sounds that are different - "e" in "misspelled" and "a" in "misapplied". However, they both have distinct vowels and are, therefore, considered different words rather than homonyms.</s>
schlee, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "schlee" and "brawny," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This particular phenomenon is known as a "pharyngeal vowel shift" or "Uralic vowel shift," where the same consonant clusters are repeated but with different vowel sounds. In "schlee," the vowel sound is "I," while in "brawny," the vowel sound is "Y." The other consonant sounds remain the same.</s>

sighed, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "sighed-borneo" have identical consonant sounds, as those sounds are 'sh' and 'b'. However, they have different vowel sounds, with 'sighed' using the vowel sound /a:/ and 'borneo' using the vowel sound /ɝ:/.</s>
imelda, millard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "Imelda-Millard" indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words begin with the letter "M" and consist of identical consonant sounds. However, the vowel sounds in each word differ: "Imelda" has a "A" vowel sound at the end, while "Millard" has an "AHD" sound at the end. This vowel sound difference distinguishes each word distinctively, thus proving they have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
lockers, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In both words, the consonant sounds are the same (the 'l', 'c', 'k', 'r', and 's' sounds remain the same), but the vowel sounds are different. The first word, 'lockers', has the vowel sound represented by the 'o' while the second word, 'litigating', has the vowel sound represented by the 'i'.</s>

ashley, gemmer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "ashley" and "gemmer," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. To break down the similarities and differences in this case:

- "Ashley" is an English name, and it includes the sounds "a" (long), "sh" (alveolar affricate), "l" (alveolar lateral unrounded), and "ey" (high back rounded).
- "Gemmer" is a synonym for someone who tends to overemphasize their words on the verge of becoming dramatic or theatrical. It includes the sounds "g" (palatal approximant), "m" (near-closed close fricative), and "r" (slack voiceless postalveolar fricative).

In terms of consonant sounds, both words contain alveolar affricate, alveolar lateral unrounded, and slack voiceless postalveolar fricative. However, the vowel sounds and the entire meaning of the words themselves are different.</s>

The vowels in "seader," "se" and "er," are [i] and [r], while in "khanna," the vowels are [a] and [n].</s>
reunite, arnett, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have the same consonant sounds except for the vowel sounds:

1. "reunite" has the pronunciation (/riːˈjuːnaɪt/) with the vowel sound /i:/.
2. "arnett" has the pronunciation (/ˈɑːrənt/), with the vowel sound /a:/.

The consonant sounds "r" and "n" are identical.</s>
fires, fors, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words given "fires" and "fors" have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. Their consonant sounds are (f) + r + (s) and (f) + r + (s) respectively. The primary distinction lies in the vowel sounds, specifically the first letter 'i' in "fires" turns into 'o' in "fors", adding a different vowel sound to each word.</s>
reierson, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the words "reierson" and "elcotel," the consonant sounds ('r' and 'l') are the same, making the words similar in this aspect. However, the vowel sounds ('i' in "reierson" and 'e' in "elcotel") are different, distinguishing the sounds in the two words.</s>
sudd, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

The word "sudd-arison" contains two different words: "sudden" and "deer". The two letters "d" in "sudden" have the same consonant sound ('t'), while the letter "r" in "deer" also has the same sound. The vowel sounds, however, are different – 'u' in "sudden" is pronounced as '/u:/', while it is 'ɪ' in "deer". Thus, these words do not share identical consonant sounds.</s>
connery, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words (connery-boren) share identical consonant sounds (C-N-R-Y-B-R-N) except for the difference in vowel sounds: connery has an unstressed consonant 'y' at the beginning, while boren has a stressed vowel 'o' in its first syllable.</s>
solder, petrelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
acid, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the word "acid," the "i" sound in "acid" is not present. Instead, there is a vowel sound that is similar to the /aɪ/ sound we hear in words like "sky" or "tea."

In the word "kenney," the "i" sound represents the /aɪ/ vowel sound we hear in words like "sky" or "tea." Additionally, the other letters "en" also create the "ain" sound we find in words such as "tin" or "man."</s>
pfahl, flour, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Pfahl" is pronounced as /pˈfɔːl/, and "flour" is pronounced as /ˈfluə/, they have all the same consonant sounds, but a different vowel sound.</s>
herlong, heling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have different vowel sounds but identical consonant sounds.

"Herlong" contains the consonants H, E, R, L, O, N, and G, while "Heling" has the same consonants H, E, L, E, and G. The only difference between the two words is the vowels: 'e' in 'Herlong' and 'i' in 'Heling'.</s>
idle, daly, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No. The words "idle" and "daly" have different consonant soundings but they are pronounced alike. They do not have identical consonant sounds, but their vowel sounds are different.</s>
gumm, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words gumm-cona have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In "gumm-cona," the consonant sounds are different, but they are derived from the same consonant combination of 'g' and 'm.' The 'g' in both words is pronounced alike and is part of their consonant sounds. The vowel sounds, however, are different. In "gumm," the 'u' sound is pronounced as a long 'u', whereas in "cona" the 'u' is short, making a 'y' sound.

In order to verify this, you can say the words out loud and compare the sounds of the specific segments you identified.</s>
sowed, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words both have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "sowed" and "zeoli." In the first word, the vowel sound is /awd/, while in the second word, the vowel sound is /ziːl/. The consonant sounds in both words are the same: /s/, /w/, /z/, /l/.</s>
zalay, osler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "zalay" and "osler," do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

"Zalay" is written as "zalay," with a vowel sound as "a".
"Osler" is written as "osler," with a vowel sound as "o."

Although they don't have the same vowel sounds, their consonant sounds are the same.</s>
zeoli, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Specifically, both words have the consonant sequence "zl". 

Justification:
In the word "zeoli," the first "l" starts a syllable and is followed by a nasal sound "i." In the word "dewinter," the first "l" also starts a syllable, but it is followed by a voiced alveolar plosive sound "d" (as in "bed," "bud," or "dodge"). So, while these words share the consonant sequence "zl," the vowel sounds and their placement in the syllable make them distinct from each other.</s>
schmoll, schmehl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
barstow, brust, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words 'barstow-brust' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. When we break down the words, we can see:

- 'bar' and 'br' have the same consonant sounds in both words.
- The vowels in these parts of each word are different - 'a' in 'bar' versus 'e' in 'br' - but the consonant sounds remain the same.

So, while the vowel sounds are different, the consonant sounds are the same and this is what gives the similarity for this analysis.</s>
oecd, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Example:
1. "oecd" (the organization) and
2. "jimi" (the name of a musician)

horse, haris, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "horse" and "haris" do have identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds. "Horse" has the vowel sound /ɔr/ while "haris" has the vowel sound /ɑri/</s>
chalet, petrelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, chalet-petrelli, have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The consonant sounds in the two words are the same. This is because they both begin with 'c,' have 'a' in the middle, and end with 'l' sounds. 

However, the vowel sounds in the two words are different. The first word, 'chalet', starts with 'ch', which is a voiceless affricate consonant sound /tʃ/. The second word, 'petrelli', begins with 'p', which is a voiceless bilabial plosive consonant sound /p/. The difference between these two vowel sounds can be heard when spoken individually.</s>
liqueur, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "liqueur" and "smullen" have similar consonant sounds, as they both begin with the same two sounds - "l" (the voiceless alveolar frictionless stop) and "ni" (which, though it looks different, is also pronounced with a "nuh" sound followed by a "w" sound). However, there are different vowel sounds: One in "liqueur" has an "i" sound, while in "smullen" it has a "ee" sound. But if you listen to how the words are pronounced, you will notice that they do have identical consonant sounds despite these difference in vowel sounds.</s>
gumm, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds, "g", "m", and "g" are identical in the words "gumm" and "gemme". The only difference between the vowel sounds is that the word "gumm" has the vowel "a" and "gemme" has the vowel "e". The vowel sounds, "a" and "e", are the only variations in the words, which is why they're considered the same word pronunciation, even if they don't represent the exact same letter.</s>
liebe, allbee, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "liebe" and "allbee" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The word "liebe" has the following consonant sounds: l (as in "lady"), i (as in "bit"), e (as in "knee"), b (as in "bad"), and e (as in "happy").

The word "allbee" has the following consonant sounds: a (as in "cat"), l (as in "lady"), l (as in "fall"), b (as in "bad"), and e (as in "happy").

There is only one consonant sound shared between the two words - "e" (as in "happy"). The rest of the consonant sounds are different.</s>
o'shell, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "o'shell-cannery" and another example you didn't provide, have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The two vowels are /e/ and /a/ in "o'shell-cannery." However, the first word has an additional 'h' at the beginning, and the second word has a '-' in the middle, but these minor differences do not change the consonant sounds of the words.</s>
soady, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, 'soady' and 'arison' do have identical consonant sounds (s, t, o, d, y for the first word, and s, r, o, s, n for the second word), while they have different vowel sounds. However, you can pronounce both words by simply switching the endings around and changing the stress on the consonants.</s>
koehn, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

`koehn` and `prom` both have different consonant sounds and vowel sounds. The first word, `koehn` has consonant sounds "k," "o," "ə," "ə," and "n," which are distinct among each other. 

The second word, `prom`, has consonant sounds "p," "r," "o," and "m," which are also distinct among each other.

The only thing that they share is the presence of the vowel sound "o," but this is the same vowel sound in both words, where no change has taken place. Consequently, the consonant sounds in both words are distinct from each other; thus, we cannot say they have identical consonant sounds.</s>
sheely, shiloh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the words "sheely" and "shiloh," the consonants (excluding vowels) appear in identical order: "SSHL," "SL," and "LHL" for "sheely" and "SSH," "SH," and "LN" for "shiloh." Although the vowel sounds in each word are different – 'ee' (ee) in "sheely" and 'oo' (oo) in "shiloh" – the consonant sounds remain the same. Therefore, these words can be considered as having the same underlying structure with different vowel combinations.</s>
lair, luria, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "lair" and "luria" have identical consonant sounds (both start with "l" and end with "r"), but they have different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds in "lair" are "l" followed by "r," while in "luria," the consonant sound is "l," but the following sound is "i" rather than "r" in "lair." The overall pronunciation differs slightly between the two words due to the vowel sounds, but they share many common consonant sounds.</s>
immerse, miesse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "immerse," the vowel sound is /ɪmərs/, while in "miesse," the vowel sound is /maɪz/. Despite the different vowel sounds, both words share the identical consonant sounds.</s>
connor, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

In the words "connor" and "barrineau," the two vowel sounds at the beginning (both "a" sounds) are different, resulting in two distinct word sounds. However, all the consonant sounds are identical, making this analysis relevant only to the beginning vowel sounds.</s>
dedeaux, dowdy, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "dedeaux" and "dowdy" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
stalowa, astley, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "stalowa" and "astley" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The consonant sounds, or the letter groupings (the segments of speech that are distinct from one another without any airflow), consist mostly of the same characters (a 't', 'l', 'w', 's', 'a', 's', and 'y'). However, the difference lies in their vowel sounds.

In Spanish and Dutch language, the word 'v', in the context of a vowel sound pronunciation, is represented by the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) symbol 'w', which is equivalent to the English "v" sound. However, in English, or the most common variants of it, the sound of 'v' is represented by the English pronunciation "v", which is a phonetic transcription of the English 'v' sound.

In this case, 'stalowa' and 'astley' both share the 'v' sound in the middle, but with different positions: 'stalowa' comes from the Polish word "stalowa," and 'astley' originates English. The English 'astley' is a variation of the name 'Astley', with the 's' being a regular 's' sound (and not 'v') and the 't' being silent in the first part of the word (e.g., it sounds like "as" plus "tley"). In contrast, 'stalowa' has a more unique 'v' sound in "v'w" position. You will need IP
annex, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words have the same consonant sounds (k, s, c, n, t, f) but have different vowel sounds (a, i).</s>
chalet, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned "chalet" and "guertin" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. However, the consonant sounds are the same in both words, which is a common characteristic in French and other Romance languages. In this case, both words share the consonant sounds "ch", "a", "l", "t" which together produce the same underlying consonant sound in the mouth.</s>
keehan, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
floats, felts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "floats" and "felts" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In "floats," the vowel sound is /a/, while in "felts," the vowel sound is /ɛ/. Both of these vowel sounds represent a single phoneme, but they are phonetically distinct. Phonological analysis would interpret the two words as having different meanings or structures due to these phonetic differences.</s>
curries, kays, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
oops, pesce, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "oops-pesce" have identical consonant sounds (o, p, s, c) but different vowel sounds (ea and ue in the words "oops" and "pesce").</s>
sudd, petralia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
muske, majeske, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'muske-majeske' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Justification: In both words, the consonant sounds remain the same (m-, s-, and s-), but the vowel sounds differ (u in 'muske' vs. e in 'majeske'). This difference in vowel sounds results in a different spelling and pronunciation for the words.</s>
shill, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
seda, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in "seda" and "lockers" are different, but the identical vowel sound in both words is the A sound.</s>
roesner, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In both words, the consonant sounds are identical: [r-z-n-r-z-n-r]. However, the vowel sounds and other elements differ:

- In 'roesner', the vowel sounds are [o-z-n-r] (long vowel sound) and short vowel sounds [ɪ] and [ɔ].
- In 'jimmie', the vowel sounds are [dʒ-ə-m-i] and [i].

Additionally, the first word has a soft 's' at the end while the second one doesn't - this doesn't affect the consonant sounds but is worth noting for pronunciation clarity.</s>
wooten, wittner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words 'wooten' and 'wittner' do indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only difference between the two words is the vowel sound, as the first vowel in each word is a different vowel (long 'a' in 'wooten' and short 'i' in 'wittner').</s>
casinos, axons, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Casinos" and "axons" both consist of identical consonant sounds (C and S). However, the vowel sounds are different: "casinos" has an "ie" sound, while "axons" has a "ou" sound (similar to the sound made in the word "motion").</s>
shelly, goyim, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelly" and "goyim" both have identical consonant sounds in the first letters of their respective words. The only difference between the two words lies in their vowel sounds - "shelly" starts with the vowel sound 'sh', while "goyim" starts with the vowel sound 'oo'. However, given their structural similarity and the overlapping sounds in the consonants, they can still be considered as having similarities in their spelling.</s>
rosten, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words have similar sounding consonants (R, S) but different vowel sounds. Rosten and Summerlin have distinct vowels (i and a) that distinguish them from each other.</s>
laack, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "laack" and "jimmy" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "laack," has a long 'a' sound in the middle, while the second word, "jimmy," has a shorter and higher 'a' sound at the beginning before the 'i' sound.</s>
rahn, raine, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "rahn" and "raine" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are "/r/", "/h/", "/n/", and "/r/" in both words. The only difference is that the vowel sound in "rahn" is /æn/ whereas the vowel sound in "raine" is /ɛɪn/, making the overall sounds different but the consonant sounds identical.</s>
shill, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "shill" and "brun." The consonants (sh and b) are the same in both words, but their vowels (i in 'shill' and u in 'brun') are different.</s>
altay, laity, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "altay" and "laity" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. However, it is important to note that the similarity in consonant sounds is due to the use of the /a/ and /e/ vowel sounds in the respective English words "altay" and "laity".</s>
follow-up, philippa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "follow-up-philippa" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowel sounds are different for each word.</s>
daughter, idiot, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words' consonant sounds are not identical, and the words' vowel sounds differ as well. 

"Daughter" begins with a "d," while "idiot" begins with a "i." Therefore, the consonant sounds are not the same. In terms of vowel sounds, "daughter" starts with a "d" followed by an "a," while "idiot" starts with a "i" followed by an "o." The vowel sounds are also different between the two words.</s>
soady, heyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "soddy-heyman" have identically the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In these words, the vowels "a" and "ee" appear as different sounds, and the consonants remain the same.</s>
murdaugh, emde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "murdaugh" and "emde", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only difference between the two words lies in the vowels - "u" and "a" in "murdaugh" and "e" in "emde". The consonants in both words do not change when switching between "murdaugh" and "emde".</s>
barn, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are identical (b, r, and n) but the vowel sounds are different (b is a short i sound, c is a short a sound, t is a short i sound, s and s are not the same, and n is a short i sound). So, "barn" and "castings" have the same consonant sounds but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
tay, outta, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No.

The words "tay-outta" cannot be considered to have identical consonant sounds as the '-t-' in "tay" is different from the '-t-' in "outta".</s>
guyton, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are also different as 'guyton' and 'jemmie' have distinct consonant patterns not shared in the other word. The vowel sounds are indeed different ( 'guy' vowel sound in 'guyton' and 'yea' vowel sound in 'jemmie'), but the consonant sounds aren't identical, so the answer is still a no.</s>
treen, tyrone, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words (treen and tyrone) start with 't' followed by the same consonant sequence. The vowel sounds, however, are distinct; the first word's vowel is an "i" sound, while the second word's vowel is an "o" sound.</s>
zel, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "zel-bruney" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In more detail:

1. "zel" and "bruney" are two separate, distinct words. The part before the hyphen (zel) is a term that is not recognizable in standard English, likely borrowed from a different language, and does not appear in any dictionaries. For simplicity, let's assume it's a typo and interpret it as "zelphyr" which means Zephyr, a nymph of the westerly wind. The term "zelphyr" is actually commonly used in meteorology to describe the gentle breeze associated with the westerly winds of autumn. So then, "zel-bruney" can be understood as "zelphyr-bruney".
2. As per phonetics, both "zelphyr" and "bruney" have different vowel sounds, which is why they are considered different words. However, they both share identical consonant sounds, i.e., "p", "b", "r", "n", "y".
3. When you write them, "zelphyr" and "bruney" look quite similar and might cause confusion when we are dealing with them as different words.

In conclusion, the words do not have identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds, but rather they share identical consonant sounds and differ in the vowel sounds of each word.</s>
baez, baz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "baez" and "baz" are a palindrome where each word has the same vowel and consonant sounds. However, the word "baz" is not pronounced the same as the name "Baez" because of the change in the vowel sound.</s>
brion, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "brion" and "jam" have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. The first word "brion" has the vowel sound (/ri/ like in "bird"), while the second word "jam" has the vowel sound (/jam/ like in "gym").</s>
puppies, paupers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two words "puppies" and "paupers" share the same seven consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. Both words start with the consonant sound [p], followed by the vowel sound [i] in "puppies." In the middle of the word, the vowel sound [i] changes to [a] in "paupers." Overall, the consonant sounds remain the same, but the vowel sounds are different, making these words similar in terms of pronunciation.</s>
alcoa's, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "alcoa's-kanner," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the first word, "alcoa's," the vowel sound /a/ is present. In the second word, "kanner," the vowel sound /ɛn/ is present. However, all other consonants in both words are identical.</s>
sheley, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words you provided, "sheley" and "nyx," both have similar consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. In both words, the consonant sounds at the beginning (sh and n) remain the same, but the vowel sounds at the end change to 'ey' in "sheley" and 'i' in "nyx." This is known as a phonetic transcription and it's a common linguistic phenomenon.</s>
divi, devaux, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given word "divi-devaux" has identical consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds are different. The first and last letters in the word (divi and aux) each have the same consonant sounds (d-v-x), but the vowels in these positions ('i' and 'u' respectively) have different sounds. This is a common feature in words involving reduplication, as it helps to emphasize the phonetic similarity of the sounds.</s>
haggart, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The two words you provided, "haggart" and "primeaux," do indeed have the same consonant sounds (i.e., "h-g-g-t"), but they have different vowel sounds. "Haggart" has an "a" sound, while "primeaux" has an "e" sound in the first syllable. However, despite the changed vowel sound of the second syllable, the two words retain their initial "g" sounds and their overall consonant sounds are identical.</s>
necaise, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words have different consonant sounds. "Necaise" has the consonants N, K, AI, S, and Z, while "smolen" has the consonants S, M, L, O, and N. The only similarity between the words is the vowel sound "AE".</s>
ceder, shirlee, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the words "ceder" and "shirlee," the consonant sounds are the same (the "c" and "s" in each of the words). However, the vowel sounds in these words differ: "ceder" has the vowel sound /i/ (pronounced "ee"), while "shirlee" has the vowel sound /aɪ/ (pronounced "yuh"). Therefore, the words are considered to have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
o'kane, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "o'kane" and "jimmie," both share identical consonant sounds (C, K, N, and E) but have different vowel sounds (O' for 'o'kane' and I for 'jimmie'). This means they are homophones, which are words with the same pronunciation but different meanings.</s>
incase, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "incase" and "jimi" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the word "incase", the consonant sounds are "I" and "S". In the word "jimi", the consonant sound is "Y". However, the vowel sounds are different - "I" in "incase" and "Y" in "jimi". For example, the first I in "incase" is an open-mid I with a high back rounded vowel whereas the Y in "jimi" is a close front unrounded vowel.</s>
sidi, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "sidi-prima" do not have identical consonant sounds, as the "s" in "sidi" is a separate phoneme than the "s" in "prima." Similarly, the "p" in "prima" and "m" in "prima" are separate phonemes. Therefore, the consonant sounds are not identical.

The vowel sounds also differ - "sidi" has a diphthong "ii" and "prima" has the central vowel "i". As a result, the consonant sounds in the two words are different, although they have similar underlying linguistic structure (both words start with "s" and end with "m").</s>
tokio, tek, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || The sentence you have provided consists of two words: "tokio-tek". Analyzing these words separately:

"tokio-tek" does indeed have two distinct words, but both words share the same root word, tokio. The first word tokio is just a shortened version of the longer adjective "tokio-tokio". So, there are three words in this sentence: (1) tokio (2) tokio-tek (3) tokio-tokio.

However, in terms of vowel sounds and distinct consonant phonemes, we would simply ignore the hyphen and analyze the phonetic value of these two root words:

- tokio - Consonants: c, k, s, o
- tokio-tokio - Consonants: c, k, s, o, -
- tokio-tek - Consonants: c, k, s, o, -

So, to answer your question, no, these two words, "tokio" and "tokio-tek", do not have identical consonant sounds, though they do share a common vowel sound, o. The vowel sounds and consonant sounds differ between each other.</s>
day's, doers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes
These words have identical consonant sounds (i.e. [d]+[a]+[y]+[s] and [d]+[a]+[y]+[s]) and different vowel sounds (e.g. /aɪ/ in 'day' and /oʊrz/ in 'doers'). The vowel sounds differ significantly and, therefore, the words are spelled identically but have different meanings.</s>
sheeler, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Sheeler and healthy are pronounced differently, with Sheeler having sh-ch-r-l-r and healthy having h-l-th-j.</s>
arrow, err, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "arrow-err" has identical consonant sounds because both words have the same consonant sequence: 'a', 'r', 'r', 'o', 'w'. The difference lies in the vowel sounds, with the first word having 'o' as the vowel sound, and the second word having 'r' as the vowel sound.</s>
homan, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "homan," the vowel sound is "uh," while in the word "kanner," the vowel sound is "ay." Despite the different vowel sounds, the consonants are the same.</s>
depaolo, deeply, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word pairs you provided both share identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. For example, in “depaolo”, the “p’ and “r” sounds are the same as in “deeply”, but the vowels in “páo”, “áo,” and “e‘ are different from the ones in “eeplly”.</s>
tay, thai, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gotten, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gotten" and "jimi" both have identically sounding consonants (g, t, and m) and different vowel sounds at the beginning and the end of the words.</s>
shirlee, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words shirlee-smullen have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
sent, sante, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "sent-sante" have the same consonant sounds (/ˈsɛntsente/) but have different vowel sounds (/sɛn, ˈsɛnt/ and /sɛnte, ˈsɛnt/).</s>
boat's, beitz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "boat's-beitz" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They both appear to have the following words: 
- "boat" as the first segment for both, with the words having distinct vowel sounds. 
- Then comes "-s-" which is identical in both words, followed by "beitz"
Further analysis of the pronunciation reveals that the 'e' in both cases becomes distinct to the way it is pronounced in the words - "beatz" with a 'z' sound.</s>
laborer, allbee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
rotan, return, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds between the two words are the same (R, -, T, -, N). The only change is the vowel sounds (Ô in rotan and Ø in return).</s>
locher, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "locher" and "castings" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, which makes them distinct words even if they are similar in appearance. The main difference lies in the vowel sounds, where "locher" begins with the sound /o/, and "castings" starts with /aş/. Nonetheless, they are phonetically similar and have the phonemic pattern [kuːər] and [kæsɪŋs], respectively.</s>
herronimo, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words herronimo and gemme have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Justification: In both words, each consonant (h, r, r, n, m) is present, and the difference between the vowels (i in the first word and e in the second word) gives the words different pronunciations and meanings.</s>
luecke, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

"Luecke" has "u" as a vowel sound. 

"Smullen" has "u" as a vowel sound, but when pronounced, it is closer to an "o" sound due to the surrounding consonant sounds.</s>
kenn, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds are identical in both words; however, the vowel sounds are different - 'a' in "kenn" and 'o' in "chlorofluorocarbons".</s>
node, nader, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. To break down this term:

- "node" and "nader" are two different words.
- "node" means a point at which two or more data or computer networks are joined or connected.
- "nader" is the name of a person. It is pronounced as "nay-der."

So, although they share the same consonant sounds, they have different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds remain the same, but their meanings and pronunciation are distinct.</s>
berber, baba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "berber" and "baba" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In this case, "berber" has the vowel sound [e] and "baba" has the vowel sound [a]. For example, the first letter 'b' in both words is pronounced as a voiceless bilabial plosive [p].</s>
lech, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "lech-jimmie," "lech" starts with the same consonant sounds ("ch") twice and ends with the same consonant sound ("j"), while "jimmie" starts with a consonant sound ("j") and has the same consonant sound ("j") at the end. The only difference lies in the vowel sounds: "lech" has the vowel sound "ee" while "jimmie" has the vowel sound "ee." These vowels are the only differences in this particular part of the words.</s>
cannes, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cannes" and "smullen" both have identical consonant sounds (as in the English language) despite the different vowel sounds. In this case, the vowel sound is "uh" in "cannes" and "ah" in "smullen". Despite these different vowel sounds, they are still considered homophones due to their identical consonant sounds. Therefore, their pronunciation differs but is still understood by English speakers.</s>
cernuda's, sounds, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words "cernuda's" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, as the vowel sounds are different: cern and au.</s>
kainer, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, 'kainer' and 'arison' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 'Kainer' has a 'k' sound, a 'a' sound, and a 'n' sound, while 'arison' has a 'a' sound, an 'r' sound, a 'i' sound, and an 's' sound. However, when pronounced, the vowel sounds of the two words are different, as they are pronounced as /ˈkaɪ.ər.ən/ (kay-er-ən) and /ˈɛ.rɪ.zuːn/ (er-e-soon).</s>
tirey, terre, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds (T R), but different vowel sounds (e in "tirey" and i in "terre"). This creates homophones, words that sound the same but have different meanings.</s>
lair, lire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "lair" has a voiced labiodental fricative ([f]) and "lire" has a voiced bilabial n. However, this would only become confusing if both were pronounced the same way.

The way you're worded the question assumes both words have the same pronunciation, which isn't entirely true. When pronounced the same way, the vowels in the two words still change each other:

1. Layer (lair): /ˈleəri/
2. Here (lire): /hɪri/

If, for example, both words are pronounced like /ˈlɛər/ [lair] and /hɪri/ [lire], the consonants would sound the same. However, they do not have identical consonant sounds if pronounced in the way mentioned above.</s>
koller, curlee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
eichner, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "eichner" and "rossin" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The vowel sounds are "i" in "eichner" and "u" in "rossin."</s>
kerby, aqaba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The words "kerby" and "aqaba" share every consonant sound and do not differ in any manner in that respect. However, each word carries different vowel sounds as "a" in "aqaba" and "e" in "kerby", which makes them different words. 

Vowel sounds determine the differentiation between words, while consonant sounds (in this case, identical for both words) don't make much of a difference, as words can also have similar consonant sounds without being identical words.</s>
kamler, comly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kamler" and "comly" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
trimm, atrium, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in the words "trimm" and "atrium" are the same. The vowel sounds in these words are different, though. In "trimm", the vowel sound is /ɪm/, while in "atrium", the vowel sound is /əˈtraɪəm/. However, since the consonant sounds are identical, the answer is Yes.</s>
hootie, huerter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'hootie' and 'huerter' have identical consonant sounds, but different vowel sounds. The differences lie in the vowel sounds of 'o' in the first word which is a short-i sound and a long-ae sound in the second word. The consonant sounds are the same: h-t-t-r, so the question essentially boils down to whether the two words pronounced together produce the same sound that is independent of the single words' vowel sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds would be unchanged, but the vowel sounds are different. Therefore, the answer is no.</s>
guyette, gotta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words "guyette" and "gotta" do have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. "Guyette" is pronounced /ɡuˈiːti/, while "gotta" is pronounced /ɡɒtˈeɪ. 

The task is to find whether the words have the same consonant sounds, which they do - they both start with "g," "u," and "t," followed by the same sequence of consonants. However, the vowel sounds are different: /i/ (in "guyette") and /ɪ/ (in "guyette") in the former, and /ɑt/ (in "gotta") in the latter. This is why they are considered different words based on phonetics and pronunciation.</s>
quito, keto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "quito" and "keto," have the same consonant sounds (KT). However, they contain different vowel sounds - "quito" has the vowel sound "oo" (for "oo" in "boot"), while "keto" has the vowel sound "ee" (for "ee" in "see").</s>

keehan, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
alleva, oliver, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two given words, "alleva" and "oliver," both have identical consonant sounds (a, l, l, v, e, a, and l), but they differ in vowel sounds (they have the short vowel sound for "al" in "alleva" and the long vowel sound for "a" in "oliver").</s>
tokio, attica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tokio-attica" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In linguistics, identical consonant sounds are called phonetic consonants. In these two words, most of the consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds are different. The only difference in consonant sound is the "k" sound, which is identical in both words. On the other hand, the vowel sounds ("i" in "tokio" and "a" in "attica") are different. Thus, these words differ in terms of their phonetic consonant sounds as well as vowel sounds.</s>
easel, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "easel" and "bruner" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
petralia, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

In the words "petralia" and "gemme," the consonant sounds are the same - 'p', 't', 'r', 'l', 'i', 'a', and 'm'. However, the vowel sounds are different: 'p', 't', 'r', 'l', 'i' (a) in "petralia" and 'g', 'e', 'm', 'm' (e) in "gemme". Therefore, they have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
sims, summor's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sims" and "summer" do share identical consonant sounds, as both have 's', 'm', and 'r' vowels, spelled differently but conveying the same phonetic value. However, the vowel sounds are different, with 'sims' having an 's' sound and 'summer' having an 'm' sound.</s>
retool, rattler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "retool," the vowel sound in "tool" is [a] (short A sound). In "rattler," the vowel sound in "rattler" is [ɛ̝] (schwa sound), which is different from the vowel sound in "tool." So, despite having different vowel sounds, both words have the same consonant sounds, which are "tool" and "/r t l r/" sound in "rattler."</s>
entail, nuttle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "entail-nuttle" have different vowel sounds but identical consonant sounds. However, this pairing is not typically a single English word, but rather two separate words that can be used together to form a phrase or sentence to convey a specific meaning.</s>
coriander, craned, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "coriander" and "craned" have identical consonant sounds (`kr-, n-), which means that they have the same consonants or no consonants. However, they don't have the same vowel sounds. One word has vowel sounds "i" and "e" (coriander), while the other has "n" and "e" (craned). Therefore, they do not have identical vowel sounds.</s>
shelor, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words have identical consonant sounds - "sh" and "z" are the only consonant sounds common in both words "shelor" and "zele". However, the vowel sounds are different - "i" in "shelor" is pronounced like the "ee" in "bee", while "i" in "zele" is pronounced like the "y" in "sky". As a result, both words share the same consonant sounds, while differing primarily in vowel sounds.</s>
shaul, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shaul" and "kanne" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This is because they share the first and second consonants, respectively, and only have slight differences in the beginning and end of each word. Shaul is pronounced as "she-ool," and Kanne is pronounced as "kan-ee".</s>
homann, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "homann-kearn," do indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This is because the only difference is the vowel sounds at the beginning and end of each word, which are "a" in "homann" and "e" in "kearn." The consonant sounds are identical in both words.</s>
gumm, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
madora, madry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are spelled differently but share the same consonants (m-d-r). "Madora" has the vowel sound of "A" while "Madry" has the vowel sound of "O".</s>
ermer, maia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "emer" and "mai" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Explanation:
Both words "emer" and "mai" have the following structure: "e + [consonant] + [vowel] + r" or "m + [vowel] + e". In "emer", the vowel sound is [er] and in "mai", the vowel sound is [e]. The consonant sound ("m" and "[consonant]" in each word) is present in both words, but the vowel sound is different, thus making them different words but still share the same consonant sound.</s>
petrilli, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'petrilli' and 'arseneau' do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
deigned, deanda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
lady's, eliades, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The vowel sounds in these words are different, with the word "lady" having an "i" sound and the word "eliades" having a silent "e" followed by an "i" sound. The consonant sounds are the same in both words, making them functionally close in pronunciation despite the differences in their vowel sounds.</s>
coone, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In both "coone" and "prima," the consonants ("co", "pr") are similar, but the vowels ("a" in "coone" and "i" in "prima") are different, creating unique sounds for each word.</s>
torino, tirone, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in "torino" and "tirone" are the same, but the vowel sounds (especially the "o" sound) are different, making them different words.</s>
zoll, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words "zoll" and "ozelle" have different consonant sounds even though they share the same vowel sounds. In the word "zoll," the consonant sound is /z/ and in the word "ozelle," the consonant sound is /z/ as well. However, the vowel sound /o/ is different in both words. So, the consonant part of the words is not identical, but the vowel sounds are the same.</s>
rizzo, ours, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
necaise, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Looking at "necaise" and "germer," we can see that the consonant sounds are the same (n, g, e, c, a, i, s). However, the vowel sounds are different - "e" in "necaise" and "e" in "germer." Thus, the words are similar in that they share similar consonant sounds, but they are different due to their respective vowel sounds.</s>
tamke, tomko, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "tamke" and "tomko," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They consist of the consonant letters t, m, k at the beginning and end of the words, but the vowels e in "tamke" and o in "tomko" are different. Therefore, they are pronounced differently.</s>

szalay, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of "szalay-health" are identical. However, the vowel sounds are different: "szalay" has the vowel sound /s/ (/ziːlɛɪ/), whereas "health" has the vowel sound /h/ (/ɛlθ/).</s>
heuring, harangue, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "heuring" and "harangue," the consonant sounds are identical: HR N G. However, the difference lies in the vowel sounds, with "heuring" having the vowel sound "iy" and "harangue" having the vowel sound "oy".</s>
ebright, bret, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ebright" and "bret" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Justification: The only difference between the two words is the vowel sound, which is represented by the letter "a" in "ebright" and the letter "i" in "bret". All other sounds, such as the consonant sounds, are the same.</s>
kohn, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes. Kohn and Jaimie both have identical consonant sounds (K, N, F, M, J, I) but different vowel sounds (O, AI in Kahn, AY in Jaimie).</s>
schley, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gemmer, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The words in question are "gemmer" and "easily." In both words, the consonants "g," "m," and "r" have the same sound in each word. However, the vowel sounds are different. In "gemmer," the vowel sound is /ɡ/ (/g/ combined with /ʌ/), and in "easily," the vowel sound is /i/ (/aɪ/). Thus, the consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds differ.</s>
owades, doers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "owades" and "doers" have identical consonant sounds - "ow" and "do" - but they have different vowel sounds. The first word sounds like 'ahw-id' and the second word sounds like 'doh'.</s>
shelor, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Each word has distinct consonant sounds, with 'shelor' and 'smolen' being different. The only common element is the presence of a similar vowel sound in their final syllable (each ending in the vowel 'o'), which makes the words more similar in context.</s>
antell, until, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds because the consonants are part of a sound sequence, not a distinct "consonant sound." In "antell," the consonant sound sequence is "ntl," and in "until," the consonant sound sequence is "tl." However, both "antell" and "until" share the vowel sounds "a," "i," and "l" which are different.</s>
became, bachmeier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "became" and "bachmeier" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the former word "became", the vowel sound is an "a" (e.g. as in "cat"), while in the latter word "bachmeier", the vowel sound is an "e" (e.g. as in "bet"). Thus, they share the same consonant sounds but deviate in the vowel part.</s>
schul, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words both have a similar consonant sound, but they have different vowel sounds. The words are "schul-prom," where "schul" starts with a "sh" sound and ends with a "uhl" sound, while the word "prom" starts with a "p" sound and ends with a schwa sound ("ə").</s>
powered, peddie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "powered-peddie" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word, "powered", has the consonant sounds /p/, /ɔ/, /w/, /ɪ/, /d/. The second word, "peddie", has the consonant sounds /p/ (again), /ɛ/, /d/, /aɪ/. The vowel sounds are /ɔ/, /ɛ/, /d/, and /aɪ/, which differ in both length and articulation.</s>
next, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
lech, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words "lech" and "chlorofluorocarbons" do indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. To break it down:

- "lech" starts with the same "ch" sound, and "lecher" is not a valid alternative here as it has a different first consonant.
- The pronunciation of "l" in both words are the same, but the actual sound created by it might differ slightly.
- The remaining consonants in both words are identical: "e", "r", "c", "h", "o", "r", "b", "o", "n", "s".

However, the vowel sounds are different. In "lech", the sound represented by "l" is pronounced. Whereas, in "chlorofluorocarbons", the sound represented by "l" is silent (it is replaced with a schwa sound). So, even though they share many consonant sounds, they have different vowel sounds.</s>
braner, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sudd, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sudd-berna" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Specifically, the vowel sounds in "sudd" and "berna" are /uːd/ and /bɛərənə/ respectively.</s>
shirlee, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in "shirlee" and "osler" are identical. However, the vowel sounds in the two words are different: "shirlee" has a "y" sound at the end, while "osler" has an "e" sound at the end.</s>
bessey, basso, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "bessey" and "basso" both contain two identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. In "bessey," the vowel sound is "ee," while in "basso," the vowel sound is "o."</s>
ruyle, orel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
scholey, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "scholey" and "heman" consist of the same consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. "Scholey" has the vowel sounds "sch" and "iy" (e), while "heman" has the vowel sound "h" and "eyn" (ain).</s>
solder, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "solder" and "zell" don't have identical consonant sounds, but they do share some similarities. The initial 's' and 'z' may sound quite similar, perhaps enough to confuse ear. However, the 'o' in "solder" is pronounced as a diphthong sound (as in 'dog'), while the 'o' in "zell" is not a diphthong and more likely just a simple open 'o' like in 'hot.' So, there's a difference in the way the vowels are produced, making these words not identical in consonant sounds either.</s>
amoruso, miesse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "amoruso" and "miesse," do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only vowel sound that differs is the 'o' sound in 'amoruso' and the 'e' sound in 'miesse.' This is why both words have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, and therefore, they are phonetically distinct.</s>
bruney, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both the words 'bruney' and 'primo' have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. However, these sounds are distinct and unrelated, so one word has no relevance to the other.</s>
ceder, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the words "ceder" and "barrineau," the consonant sounds are "c-d-r" and "b-r-n-w-u" respectively, which are the same in both words.

rosenow, rosano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "rosenow-rosano" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Justification: 

1. "rosenow" - The consonant sounds remain unchanged. 
2. "rosano" - "os" - The only difference between the two words, the vowel sound "o" in "rosano" moves to the front of the word, which gives it a different pronunciation.</s>
tek, attica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tek-attica" do contain identical consonant sounds, but they differ in their vowel sounds. The first word, "tek," has the vowel sound of "t," and the second word, "attica," has the vowel sound of "a." Despite the different vowel sounds, the identical consonant sounds provide a similar pronunciation for the two words.</s>
dyes, dawes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the words: "dyes" and "dawes" are not identical in terms of both consonant sounds and vowel sounds. They represent two different words with different meanings. 

"dyes" means a solution that is used to color or colorize; "dawes" is an American English surname which may refer to a place or family name. Therefore, even if the 'd' in "dyes" is followed by similar sounding consonant sounds (alveolar trill), the other vowel sounds and pronunciation are entirely different.</s>
lance, linsay, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "lance" and "linsay," the consonant sounds are different: "l" is present in "lance" and not in "linsay". The vowel sounds in each word are also different: "ance" has "a" and "n" while "linsay" has "in" and "s" as its vowels.</s>

royale, orel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "royale" and "orel" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "royale" the vowel sound is /ɔ̀/: it is a French-like 'O' sound, and the consonant sounds are the same as "orel". In the word "orel" the vowel sound is /ø/: a slightly modified 'O' sound, also known as a "schwa" sound in the English language, and the consonant sounds are the same as "royale".</s>
moulder, imelda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "moulder" and "imelda" share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. The only difference is the vowel sounds that begin each word. In "moulder," the vowel sound is "ooh," while in "imelda," the vowel sound is "eee."

The first word has an "o" sound in "conn," while the second word has an "a" sound in "bran." The overall pronunciation of the words might be quite similar, but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
seder, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "seder" and "brawny" have the same two consonant sounds (S and T) but have different vowel sounds. The vowel sound in "seder" is short, and the vowel sound in "brawny" is long. Despite these differences, each pair of words has the same two consonant sounds, making them homophones.</s>
curd, kid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "curd" and "kid" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The common consonant sounds are "c" and "k".</s>
aickin, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aickin" and "geremia" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonants in both words are the same - "ck", "g", "rh", "n". The main difference lies in the vowel sounds. "aickin" has a short "ee" sound in the first syllable and a long "ae" sound in the second syllable, while "geremia" has two distinct vowels - "ee" in the first syllable and "eee" in the third syllable.</s>
homeowner, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "homeowner" and "jimmie" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "Homeowner" has the consonant sounds "hm," "ow," and "nr," while "jimmie" has the consonant sounds "j," "m," "i," and "ie." The main difference is the vowel sound between "o" in "homeowner" and "ee" in "jimmie".</s>
zil, osler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the word "zil-osler," the vowels /ɪ/ (pronounced as "ee") and /oʊ/ (pronounced as "oo") are altered, making slight changes in the vowel sounds. This change in vowel sounds doesn't affect the consonant sound, resulting in identical consonant sounds.</s>
tomato, timeout, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

In the words "tomato" and "timeout," one can observe that the consonant sounds (the letters that represent physical sounds in our voice) are the same ('m,' 't,' 'p,' 'b,' and 't'), except for the vowel sounds ('a' in "tomato" and 'o' in "timeout"). Since the consonant sounds are the same despite the different vowel sounds, we can conclude that they share identical consonant sounds.</s>
rayson, rosanne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds (r, s, n) but different vowel sounds (i in rayson and u in Rosanne).</s>
shiller, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
nex, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nex-reasner" have identical consonant sounds ('nx', 'rs', and 'nr') but different vowel sounds ('a', 'i'), which makes them homophones (words pronounced alike but having different meanings).</s>
loynd, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, loynd-olinde, have identical consonant sounds, but they differ in their vowel sounds.

The pronunciation of loynd-olinde includes /ɔɪ.n/ for the "oin" sound, whereas, for "olinde", the pronunciation is /ɒ.lɪnd/ as it features the "o" sound. The differences in their pronunciation relate to the vowel sounds; however, the consonant sounds of both words match each other, hence, they are identical in terms of this feature.</s>

gomer, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "gomer" and "kian" do have identical consonant sounds because they share all their consonants - "g", "m", "r". However, they have different vowel sounds - "o" in "gomer" and "i" in "kian". Therefore, they are phonetically different. The vowel sounds are what make them different from each other, despite the identical consonant sounds.</s>
kian, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No

These words share identical consonant sounds, as they both start with the letter "k" followed by "i", "a", "n" or "m", and the other letters "n", "u", "m", "e", "r", "l", "i", "n". However, the words are not the same, as they have distinct vowel sounds: "kian" in the first word and "summerlin" in the second word.</s>
lynd, lundy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have the same consonant sounds but differ in their vowel sounds.

'Lynd' is spelled with a short i sound. The vowels are the schwa 'ə' sound and the yod 'j', which is silent in 'lynd'.

'Lundy' is spelled with a long 'yuh' sound. The vowels are the ua' 'wa' sound and the epsilon 'e' sound, which is silent in 'lundy'.

The main difference lies in the vowel sounds (short 'i' in 'lynd' and long 'yuh' in 'lundy').</s>
pasta, pistor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned, "pasta" and "pistor," have identical consonant sounds. This is because they both consist of the same sequence of consonants, which is "p-s-t-r." However, the words differ in terms of vowel sounds: "pasta" has the vowel sound of "a" (as in "cat"), while "pistor" has the vowel sound of "o" (as in "pot").</s>
cod, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided "cod-arseneau" have identical consonant sounds (C-D-K-), but they have different vowel sounds (/oː/ and /æ/).</s>
haggart, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the word "haggart," all letters represent consonants. In the word "guertin," the vowel "e" is repeated, which results in different vowel sounds ('e' in "haggart" and 'i' in "guertin"). The consonant sounds are the same, but the difference in vowels leads to a completely different word pronunciation.</s>
cernuda's, sandos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "cernuda's-sandos," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The two words are not phonetically the same, but they do share some key consonantal characteristics, such as the presence of the "c," "n" and "s" sounds in both words.</s>
amilia, muller, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "amilia-muller" indeed have identical consonant sounds and slightly different vowel sounds. The only vowel sound that differs is in the first word, "amilia," which has the vowel sound "a." In the second word, "muller," the vowel sounds the "u" in "uller," which in this context seems to be the same word. This results in "amilia" and "muller" having four vowel sounds (aei, e) and three double consonant combinations, but with slightly different vowel sounds, leading to the perception of small variations in the overall pronunciation when the two words are spoken.</s>
gerk, gekko, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, in the words "gerk" and "gekko," the consonant sounds are the same - /k/ in both words. The only difference is the vowel sounds: "gerk" has the vowel sound /e/, while "gekko" has the vowel sound /o/.</s>
brussels, barcellos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Brussels is a city in Belgium, and Barcellos is a Portuguese surname.

mentel, minutely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "mentel" and "minutely," both have identical consonant sounds, but they differ in vowel sounds. The only difference between these two words is the vowel sound, with "mentel" having a [mɪntl] vowel sound and "minutely" having a [mɪnˈtjuːlɪ] vowel sound. Although the consonant sounds remain the same, the change in vowel sound results in two distinct words, with each serving different purposes and possibly different meanings as well.</s>
rasner, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words "rasner" and "jimmy" are pronounced with the same consonants "r", "s", "n", "j", "m", and "y".

pralle, pirelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pralle" and "pirelli" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
zelia, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, based on the given information, the words "zelia-kanner" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The justification for this conclusion is that the words share the same consonant sounds (z, e, l, i-double, a, k, n) regardless of vowel positions. Each word consists of six letters, and the only differences in the arrangement of consonants and vowels are in the placement of the vowels:
- In “zelia”, the vowel ‘a’ comes at the first position, while
- In “kanner”, it comes at the second position.</s>
litigating, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The words "litigating" and "locatelli" have the same consonants in the same order, but the vowels in the words are different, which is why they have different meanings and sounds when spoken. In the first word, "i" is the vowel and in the second, "e" is the vowel.</s>
coody, curd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of 'coody' and 'curd' are identical. The difference lies in their vowel sounds. 'Coody' has a "oo" vowel sound, while 'curd' has a "ooo" or "er" vowel sound. In terms of consonant sounds, both words are the same.</s>
oecd, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in "oecd-health" are the same, but the consonant sounds in "oecd" appear in a different order between the two words.

The consonant sounds in "oecd" are "oek" that is followed by a vowel "d". In the second word "health", the consonant sounds are "h" followed by a vowel "e", "ea" followed by a vowel "th". So, the consonant sounds are not the same but are very similar, with a difference of only one vowel sound. Therefore, the answer is "Yes", these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
ploys, apple's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ploys" and "apple's" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are "pl," "l," and "s," and the vowel sounds are "o" at the end of "ploys" and "u" at the end of "apple's." These sounds are the same, but the vowels are different, causing the words to be spelled in different ways and pronounced differently.</s>
maids', moody's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sheley, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of the word "sheley-noakes" are identical, but the vowel sounds are different. There are two words here:
1. "Sheelay" is a proper noun.
2. "Noakes" is a surname.
Both words end with the consonant sound "-ks", but the vowels "i" and "e" in "Sheelay" and "o" in "Noakes" are different. Therefore, the vowel sounds in the two words are different despite having identical consonant sounds.</s>
patrol, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words share multiple identical consonant sounds, but they are different in vowel sounds. 

- "Patrol" has a [p], [a], [t], [r], [o], and [l] sound.
- "Primo" has a [p], [r], [i], [m], [o] sound.

Since all consonant sounds (except the vowels) are the same, we can determine that they have identical consonant sounds. However, the vowel sounds are different, making them different words.</s>
ikon, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "ikon" and "arison," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are present in the beginning of each word, and while the vowel sounds are different (with "i" in "ikon" and "e" in "arison"), the overall structure and pronunciation remain the same, with only a small variation in the vowel sound.</s>
billiter, balletto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the first word, "billiter," the consonant sounds are 'B-L-I-T-L-E-R.'
In the second word, "balletto," the consonant sounds are 'B-A-L-L-E-T-T-O.'

Though the vowel sounds are different ('I-E' and 'E'), the consonant sounds are identical. This is why we can say that they have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
saudi, huguet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saudi-huguet" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Justification: 
The first word, "saudi-huguet," has the consonant sequence "s-h," which is the same in both words, indicating that they share identical consonant sounds. However, the vowel sounds in each word are different. The first word has "ae" in "saudi" and two vowels followed by "yt" in "huguet." In contrast, the second word contains the sequence "s-h" again, but with the additional vowel "u" in "huguet." Comparing the vowel sounds in both words, "ae" and "u," the differences lie in the vowel sounds, rather than the consonant sounds.</s>
sunday's, cernuda's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the first four words (sunday's, cernuda's) have identical consonant sounds, while their vowel sounds differ.

Justification:

In the words 'sunday's' and 'cernuda's', the word structure and phonetic arrangement remain the same. The vowels 'u' and 'a' are the only exceptions in the word 'sunday's'. The 'u' changes from being a fronted, u [uə] in the first word to a back rounded vowel [a] in the second word, 'cernuda's'. In the words 'sunday's' and 'cernuda's', all other consonants remain the same.

Thus, even though there are changes in the vowel sounds, the consonant sounds of the words remain the same. However, we should also note that they are at the different ends of the vowel spectrum 'unrounded' and 'back' rounded). While this difference in vowel feature of sounds may or may not be noticeable depending on the language and context.</s>
easily, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "easily-germe" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are the same in both words - the letters "l", "m", and "r" which are the same in "easily" and "germe". The only difference lies in the vowel sounds, where "i" in "easily" is pronounced as "ee" and "a" in "germe" is pronounced as "a".</s>
apec, pokey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
leaps, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || Based on the given words 'leaps' and 'lips', the answer is Yes. Both words have identical consonant sounds (e.g. "l", "p", and "s") in the beginning, middle, and end of the respective words. The only difference is the vowel sound, which is "a" in 'leaps' and "s" in 'lips'.</s>
summaries, semis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "summaries" and "semis" have identical first three consonant sounds ("sm-") but differ in their vowel sounds. "Summaries" has "ee" as its final vowel sound, while "semis" has "s" as its final vowel sound.</s>
balzer, bylaws, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words have the same consonant sounds ([b], [l], [z] in "balzer", [j], [l] in "bylaws"), but the vowel sounds are different: "a" in "balzer" and "e" in "bylaws".</s>
tor, tirey, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No.

The words "tor-tirey" do not have identical consonant sounds. "Tor" and "tirey" contain different consonants, and this is part of the reason the words do not have identical consonant sounds, despite possessing similar phonetic structures. 

The consonants in "tor" are "th" (both "t" is silent) whereas, in "tirey", the consonants are "thor" with a "u" sound for the "ee" sound and an "e" sound for the "y" sound, making it "theory". The vowel sounds are different, but the fact remains that the consonant sounds are different, thus not having identical sounds.</s>
homann, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "homann-next" possess identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This is because the consonants are the same, while the vowels in each word differ in pronunciation. 'Homann' starts with a "h" and has the pronunciation "oh-mahn". 'Next' starts with a "n" and has the pronunciation "nuk-set". The two words differ in the vowel sounds used.</s>
boys', boos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
avalon's, villines, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "avalon's" and "villines", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words have the same sequence of consonant sounds (CVCVC), such as p, f, and v, followed in each case by the vowel e. The only difference between the two words is the vowel sounds that follow the consonant sounds. In "avalon's," the first e is followed by a long sound, while in "villines," the first e is followed by a short sound. Thus, the two words share the same consonant sounds but not vowel sounds.</s>
gokey, gocke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "gokey" and "gocke," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. However, if you want to check their similarity, you could consider them homophones, which means they have the same pronunciation and can be used interchangeably without introducing confusion.</s>
aachener, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "aachener" and "bowron" both have some identical consonant sounds, but their vowel sounds are different, making their meanings distinct from one another. 

In the first word, "aachener," the 'a' is pronounced like the vowel in "cat." The second vowel ('a') is similar to the 'e' in "bed." The remaining four letters have distinct sounds.

The second word, "bowron," features a 'b' pronounced like 'p'. The 'o' sounds like 'o', while the 'w' is similar to 'w'. The 'r' comes in at the end with its typical 'r' sound.

It might be instructive to note the spelling differences in the two words. The original word is a proper noun, "Aachen," which is a city in Germany and has historically been the capital of the Duchy of Aachen. The other word, "Bowron," could be a surname, but it is not certain. The common denominator between these two words is just the same set of consonant sounds.</s>
surat, esty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "surat" and "esty," have the same consonant sounds (S, R, T) but different vowel sounds (u in "surat" and e in "esty"). So, they are a case of homophones, which are words that sound the same but have different meanings or spellings.</s>

erlach, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "erlach" and "chlorofluorocarbons" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only vowel sound difference between the two words is in the first syllable "erla" vs "chlo" which results in a change of the second vowel sound ("chlorofluorocarbons"). Despite these differences, the vowel sounds are the same in both words, and no consonant sounds are different between the two words.</s>
chalet, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. They have different consonant sounds as well. The word "chalet" has a [k]-[h]-[a]-[l]-[et] pronunciation, while the word "boren" has a [b]-[o]-[r]-[n] pronunciation.

maracle, markel, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No.

While both words have consonant sounds that are identical, i.e., "m," "r", "a", "c", and "l", the vowel sounds are different:

maracle - (/məˈrɑkəl/) first part: mar-
markel - (/ˈmɑrkəl/) second part: mark-

So these two words have different vowel sounds, not identical ones.</s>
nunn, gnann, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "nunn" and "gnann" share identical consonant sounds (n, g, and n), but the vowel sounds are different. The first word, "nunn," has the vowel sound /ən/ and the second word, "gnann," has the vowel sound /ɛn/ (the short i sound). Despite the different vowel sounds, the consonants in both words are identical.</s>
summaries, sims, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words, "summaries-sims," have identical consonant sounds since they have the same sequence of consonants (S S M M R R). However, they have different vowel sounds. "Summaries" has the vowel sound of /aɪ/ (short for "I") while "sums" has the vowel sound of /ʌmz/ (short for "muscle"). Therefore, the main difference between these two words lies in their distinct vowel sounds.</s>
royer, irey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, 'royer' and 'irey', do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The justification is the presence of similar-sounding consonant clusters in both words, such as 'ry' in 'royer' and 'ry' in 'irey'. However, the distinct difference can be found in the vowel sounds, which are 'o' in 'royer' and 'ee' in 'irey'. Despite this small difference, the consonant clusters in these words are identical due to the overall structure of the words.</s>
pfahl, pfohl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "pfahl-pfohl," the identical consonant sounds are the consonant 'p.' However, the vowels in each word are different, with 'ahl' in the first word and 'ohl' in the second word.</s>

amoruso, immerse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "amoruso" and "immerse" both have identical consonant sounds of 'm,' 'o,' 'r,' and 'o' at the beginning and 's' in between, but they differ in their vowel sounds. The first word, "Amoruso", has a 'o' at the end, while the second word, "immerse", has a 'e' at the end. Therefore, they belong to the same vowel sound pattern but have different vowel sounds.</s>
courtesy, eckert's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the following words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds:

1. "courtesy" and "eckert's"

In the word "nichter," the "i" in "nicht" and "r" in "nichter" produce a vowel sound. In the word "ancheta," the "a" in "ancha" and "t" in "ancheta" produce a vowel sound. The consonants of the words are identical, but the vowel sounds are different, making them distinct from one another.</s>
shelley, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words, "shelley" and "o'connor," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
kain, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kain-boren" both have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Here's a breakdown:

- "Kain" has the vowel sound [ɪ] for the first vowel (as in "knee") and [aɪ] for the second vowel (as in "high").
- "Boren" has the vowel sound [ɔː] for the first vowel (as in "oar") and [rən] for the second vowel (as in "runner").

So, both words share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds, resulting in different pronunciations.</s>

The consonants are "P" and "S", "S" and "S", "P" and "P", "L" and "L", "P" and "P", "M" and "M", "P" and "F", "Y" and "Y". They are the same but the vowels are "E" and "O", and the letters "EL" and "OP" have the same sound, "EL" = "OP".</s>
nyx, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

The justification for this is that the words you provided do have different consonant sounds. "Nyx" and "jammer" share the same consonant sounds in each word, but they differ in their vowel sounds. "Nyx" starts with the vowel sound /aɪ/, and "jammer" starts with the vowel sound /dʒ/. These differences show that the consonant sounds are not the same for each word.</s>
cede, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "cede-sterilizations" do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds in the two words are the same, however, the vowel sounds are different - "e" in the first word and "i" in the second word.</s>

In this pair, 'consonant' and 'promise' are composed of the same consonant sounds but switch the vowel sounds.</s>
locher, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In the words "locher" and "germe," the consonant sounds are the same but the vowel sounds differ, resulting in a spelling-pronunciation distinction between the two words.</s>
ybanez, bono's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words, "ybanez" and "bono" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They have the same consonant sounds when pronouncing them without considering their final consonants. 

The vowel sound difference comes from the different initial sounds of the words:

- In "ybanez," the short "i" sound before the "y" (as in "sigh") and the long "iy" sound (as in "lion") together make an "iy" sound.
- In "bono," the "i" sound before the "n" (as in "bit") and the "o" sound (as in "ot") together make a "oy" sound.

So, while the consonant sounds are identical, the vowel sounds are different, creating a difference between the words.</s>
ruyle, rollie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. "R" is the only different letter in the first two words, but it's pronounced the same way in both (as in "car" and "fur"). The vowel sounds in both words are also very similar: one of them starts with a rolled 'r' (e.g., in "murmur") while the other does not.</s>
linus, linsay, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the given words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Linus and Linsay do share some consonant sounds in common, including 'L' and 'N.' However, the vowel sounds are different between the two words. Lincoln has a long 'E' sound for 'in' and 'c'-sound-like for the 'k' sound, whereas Linsay has a 'Y' sound for the 'in' and 'S' for the 'c' sound-like the 'k' sound in 'Lincoln.'</s>
schley, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "schley" and "prom" have identical consonant sounds as both of them have the same consonant pattern. However, they have different vowel sounds. The word "schley" starts with the vowel sound /ʃ/, while "prom" starts with the vowel sound /pəm/ which is a different consonant. Therefore, while they share the same consonant pattern, they have different vowel sounds.</s>
prody, perdue, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds are different. In "prody," the vowel sound is /o/, and in "perdue," the vowel sound is /ɛ/.</s>
mieske, mosco, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds (M, I, S, K, E) at the beginning and shared consonant sounds (S, K, E) at the end. However, the vowel sounds differ - mieske has the vowel sound a in "maize," while mosco has the vowel sound o in "moose."</s>
strnad, standre, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in strnad and standre are the same (sn, br, d, r). However, the vowel sounds are different (i, a, no-shifting sound, e). The difference in vowel sounds makes these words distinct.</s>
petrilla, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words have the following consonant sounds: petrilla-kain. Specifically, they have the letter 'p', 't', and 'k' present in both words. However, the vowel sounds differ. In "petrilla," the final consonant is a 'l' sound, while in "kain," the final consonant is a 'n' sound. These two consonant sounds are, therefore, identical but the vowels are different.</s>
bresser, brass, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bresser" and "brass" have identical consonant sounds (c, s, r, s, r) and different vowel sounds (open e versus short a).</s>
suder, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "suder-caen" both have identical consonant sounds but differ in their vowel sounds. "Suder" has the vowel sound in 'happy', written as [a] and "caen" has the vowel sound in 'green', written as [ɛ̃], which represents the close front unrounded vowel. The "e" in 'caen' is pronounced like in 'bet', but higher in pitch.</s>
loynd, lindy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words, "loynd" and "lindy," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
encase, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the word 'encase', the first letter 'e' is pronounced as 'ay' while the 'n' is pronounced as 'n'. The 'c' and 's' are the only consonant sounds present in this word.

In the word 'rasner', the first 'r' is a palatal click sound usually produced with the tongue touching the alveolar ridge, and later is followed by the 'n' sound which is also pronounced as 'n'. 

So, while 'encase' and 'rasner' both share various consonant sounds, the vowel sounds in each word are distinct and not identical. Thus, the consonant sounds are identical, but the vowel sounds are different, making the consonant/vowel distinction significant.</s>
sheley, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "sheley-rosten" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, as evidenced by the letters 'e' and 'o' at the end of each word. The consonant sounds are identical because they both end with the letters -l- and -n-. The vowel sounds, however, differ as 'e' sounds like /i:/ in "sheley" and 'o' in "rosten" sounds like /o/ or /o:/ depending upon the stress placed on the syllable.</s>
o'shell, petrilla, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
aqaba, cab, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, I can confirm that these words indeed have identical 'consonant sounds' but completely different 'vowel sounds'. These words are 'aqaba' and 'cab' respectively. The consonant sounds are the same but the vowels in each of these words are different. It's like saying 'aak-aak' vs 'kab', where the consonants are the same but the vowels are different.</s>
cede, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
lookers, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "lookers-germe" and "lookers-germane", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Specifically, they both share the root vowels "oo," "k" and "m," but the sound of the subsequent vowels and the presence of a "e" at the end of the first word give it a slightly different pronunciation. The only other difference is the last vowel "e" in "lookers-germane" is pronounced (or silent) as a schwa sound, whereas "lookers-germe" has a short "e" with an unstressed pronunciation. Despite these seemingly minor differences, the two words are still pronounced identically in terms of consonants.</s>
bryon, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "bryon" and "prem" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In words "bryon" and "prem", the consonant sounds are identical, which are 'b', 'r', 'y', and 'n'. The vowel sounds, however, are different in the two words. The vowel sound in "bryon" is 'I' (which corresponds to the letter 'y') while in "prem" the vowel sound is 'आ' (Epicode: ALPHA) which is a unique Devanagari script representation of a sound that does not exist in the English language.

I used a Unicode converter (https://www.unicode.org/charts/unihan.html) to convert the Devanagari script 'आ' to 'A' to match the consonant sounds in English. 

So, in summary, while the consonants are the same, the vowel sounds are different, making the two words distinct.</s>
rasorite, rosty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sheley, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No.

These words, "sheley-summerlin," do not have identical consonant sounds. The word "sheley" has a 'sh' sound in the first syllable, and a 'th' sound in the second. Whereas, the word "summerlin" has an 's' sound in the first syllable and a 'mm' sound in the second. The consonant sounds are quite different, while the vowel sounds are different between the last two syllables. So it is not true that these words have identical consonant sounds.</s>
isch, hsieh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are ['ish' and 'sh'].</s>
curries, cause, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "curries" and "cause" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In "curries," the vowel sound is /uː/ (/y/), which is written as "y" in the written language.

In "cause," the vowel sound is /ɔːs/. It is also a written as "o" in the written language.

However, both words have the same consonant sounds, as these words include the consonant cluster /kr/. Therefore, this condition is met.

So, the correct answer is Yes, it is correct to say that both words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds; the only difference is the vowel sound in the starting consonant cluster.</s>
zulli, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zulli" and "ireson" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

Here is why: The word "zulli" has a 'u' vowel, while the word "ireson" has an 'e' vowel. These two vowels are pronounced differently, producing different sounds. Therefore, even though the consonant sounds are the same, the vowel sounds are not, creating the differentiation between the two words. In linguistics, this is referred to as having the same root or basis, but with phonetic variations.</s>
sheeler, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the consonant sounds in "sheeler" and "ken" are not identical. The consonant sounds in these words are /ʃ/ and /ɛn/ respectively. However, the vowel sounds are identical in that they are both /iɪ/ in both words. 

In English, the consonants /ʃ/ and /ɛn/ are pronounced as follows: 
 /ʃ/ is a voiceless spirant, which is a type of consonant that stops or releases air flow quickly or between vowels. It is often referred to as a 'ch' or 'sh' sound. This sound is produced by closing the vocal tract and allowing air to flow past the back of the tongue. The tongue position is closer to the roof of the mouth than when producing the voiced /ʃ/, but still higher than the central part of the mouth. 

 /ɛn/ is a short /ɛ/ vowel, which is a simple and short (non-diphthongized) high central vowel. This vowel is usually pronounced with the tongue at the center of the roof of the mouth and the lips in a relaxed position. When saying "ken" with this vowel sound, the tongue would be positioned just above the hard palate, high in the mouth.</s>
aside, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aside" and "zel" have identical consonant sounds (both start with 'z') and different vowel sounds. The former word has an 'a' after the 'z', while the latter has a 'e' after the 'z'.</s>
husky, hasek, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the word "husky", the consonant sounds are "h", "u", "s", "k", and "i". In the word "hasek", the consonant sounds are "h", "a", "s", "e", and "k". The only common consonant sound is "h", but other consonant sounds are different.</s>
oslo, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "oslo" and "bruner" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "oslo," the vowel sound is /a/, and in "bruner," it is /u/.</s>
necaise, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
garry, gore, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "garry" and "gore," have different vowel sounds, but their consonant sounds are identical. They have a "g" followed by a "r" and an "e" sound. This is the same for both words, but the vowel sound changes, making the words different phonetically. Therefore, they are homophones, words that have the same pronunciation but different meanings or spellings in different contexts.</s>
sighed, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The justifications for this are as follows: 

1. 'sighed' and 'hannam': The individual consonant sounds are not identical - s is not the same as n - but the rhyme is achieved by having the same vowel sounds. Comparing the words, the consonant sounds are s and h, s and n, a and a, i and e, g and n, whereas the vowel sounds of the words are i, a, i, e, g, and n, respectively. So despite the difference in consonant sounds, both words share the same two vowel sounds (i and a), thus achieving word rhyme.</s>
gumm, petralia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
bachmeier, beckum, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "bachmeier-beckum" have identical consonant sounds, as both words share the same consonant sequences (b, c, h, m, and r), but they have different vowel sounds. The vowel sounds in these words are as follows:

- Bachmeier: i (pronounced as 'ee' in English)
- Beckum: u (pronounced as 'oo' in English)

Therefore, while these words may seem similar due to their consonant sounds, they have different vowel sounds and thus, different pronunciations.</s>
hohman, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "hohman" and "prom" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are /h/, /o/, /o/, /m/, /p/, /r/, /o/, and /m/. 

Justification:

- The words "hohman" and "prom" share their first and last sounds, both beginning with /h/ and ending with /m/.
- At their second spot, "hohman" has an /o/ sound and "prom" has a /p/ sound.
- The remaining sounds are /o/ in both words but they have different vowel sounds because they are pronounced differently. 

In conclusion, identical consonant sounds can be found in "hohman" and "prom", but the vowel sounds in both words are distinct and altered from each other for their respective purposes of pronunciation and meaning.</s>
necaise, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds, but they do share one vowel sound - the "i" sound in "jimmie". The other vowels, "e" and "i", have different pronunciations in each word.</s>
enix, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "enix-khanna" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In English, this pattern of identical consonants is known as "schwa sound" - a vowel that is represented in various ways (e.g., /ɛnɪks/, /ɛnɪx/, /ənɪks/, /ənɪx/). The pronunciation of either word is just slightly different due to the variation in the vowel sounds.</s>
solder, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the answer is yes. According to phonetics, solder and primeaux have the same pattern of consonant sounds (i.e., 'l' at the beginning and 'd' in the second position) and the same consonant length. The pronunciation of the letters 'a,' 'u,' 'o,' and 'e' remain unchanged. However, these words have different vowel sounds – 'o' in solder and 'o' in primeaux. The change in the vowel sound from 'o' to 'u' in primeaux is the primary distinction for differentiating the two words.</s>
sawdey, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the word "sawdey," the vowel sound is "i" (e.g., in "ride"). In the word "primo," the vowel sound is "o" (e.g., in "toe") similar to "sawdey," both words have the same consonant sounds like "S-A-W-D-E-Y- and P-R-I-M-O".</s>
saudi, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "saudi-elcotel," have different letters in their vocabulary but share identical consonant sounds. In the word "saudi," the vowel sound "i" is different from the vowel sound "e" in "elcotel." Despite these changes in vowel sounds, the consonants in both words are the same.</s>
pty, petteway, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are "cty-petteway" and "pty-petteway." However, when pronounced, the only difference is the vowel sound in the word "pty-petteway." 

In the first word "cty-petteway," the "c" is followed by the vowel sound "i" as in "city." The other letters form the same consonant sounds as in the word "petteway."

In the second word "pty-petteway," the "c" is still followed by the vowel sound "i" as before, hence it still has the same consonant sounds as in the first word. The only variation is the additional "t" before the first vowel, which creates a "p" followed by "i" in the vowel sound. In the second word, the "p" is silent, and hence the correct pronunciation would be "tey-petteway."

So, in conclusion, despite the seemingly different spelling, the words have identical consonant sounds, but the main difference is the vowel sound change, making them essentially different words.</s>
sewed, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "sewed-khanna" have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The first word has the vowels 'e' and 'o,' whereas the second word has the vowels 'a' and 'o.'</s>
soeder, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "soeder" and "jimmie" have the same consonant sounds (s, o, d, r, j, m, and i), but have different vowel sounds (i for "soeder" and ee for "jimmie"). However, the consonant sounds might be perceived as similar as well which is why these words are often grouped together when considering homophones.</s>

idle, dehler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
settle, stille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in these two words are the same: settle and stille. The only difference is the vowel sound, with settle pronounced as /sɛtəl/ and stille as /ˈstɪl/ or /ˈstɪliː/.

Settle is a verb that means to put in a settled condition or establish as correct. Its pronunciation in English typically follows the /sɛtəl/ pattern: the 'e' sound is pronounced as a long 'i' sound, the 't' is pronounced as a 't' with a puff of air, and the final '-le' is pronounced separately.

Stille on the other hand, is a noun derived from the Italian word 'stile' which means a manner of writing or communication. Although, the pronunciation could vary between different dialects, in general, Stille is pronounced with a soft 'i' sound at the beginning followed by a 'u' and a 'l' with a puff of air: /ˈstɪl/ or /ˈstɪliː/.

To sum it up, while the consonant sounds stay the same in settle and stille, the vowel sounds change from /ɛ/ in settle to /ɪ/ and /ɪ/ in stille.</s>

The remaining sounds are different: in the first word, the "o" sound is diphthongized as in "row", and in the second word, it is "rune". This change alters the vowel sound in each word.</s>
brunty, aberrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
patrol, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds of "patrol" and "keene" are identical, but the vowel sounds differ, resulting in different pronunciations. This makes them different words rather than homophones.</s>
oslo, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "oslo" and "rasner" have identical consonant sounds (oss-l-r-n-r), but the vowel sounds are different. In the first word "oslo," the "o" is pronounced with an open, back, and rounded vowel sound, while, in the second word "rasner," the "o" is pronounced with a mid-front, rounded vowel sound. This distinction creates a difference in the pronunciation of the two words.</s>

"Hermon" begins with the vowel sound of "h" which is not present in "jemmie". Although both words start with the consonant sound of "H", the vowel sound played a significant role in determining the overall sound of each word.

In summary, the similar consonant sounds found in both words can be attributed to their shared beginnings with the "H" sound. However, the fundamental difference lies in the vowel sounds with which each word begins: "hermon" starts with "H" followed by "E" and "R", while "jemmie" starts with "J" followed by "E", "M", and "E".</s>

panton, pantano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

The justification for this response is that while these words are close together in the dictionary, they vary slightly in both their consonant and vowel sounds.

Ayerst is the name of a pharmaceutical company that manufactures a range of medications, including a vaccine and antibiotics. The word has words beginning with "ay" (e.g., "ayes" and "ayed"), indicating that one of the vowels (e.g., a or u) is long in this context.

Rasorite, on the other hand, is a brand name of a non-oxidizing, zinc-rich, waterborne hydroxyapatite coating used as a corrosion inhibitor. Both the words are related to coating and hence have similar consonant sounds, but different stress patterns and vowel sounds.</s>
hergert, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hergert" and "bahraini" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds in each word. H and R are the only consonants that appear in both words but have different vowel letters, as highlighted in the table below:

| Word | Consonant Sounds |
|------|-----------------|
| hergert | /hɛrɡɛrᵾt/ |
| bahraini | /bɔhəˈreɪni/ |

The vowel sounds, however, differ: "ɑ" as opposed to a neutral vowel (/ə/ or /ɪ/) in "hergert" and "eɪ" (open-mid front unrounded vowel) in "bahraini." Nonetheless, these words still share the same consonant sounds, which explains a similar pronunciation and allows them to fit together in this sentence.</s>
saudi, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

The words "saudi-jammer" have the same consonant sounds (S, J, D, R) that are repeated in both words. The only difference lies in the vowel sounds of the two words; the first word, "saudi-jammer," has the vowels (A, D, E, I, u). The second word, on the other hand, has different vowel sounds (o, u). The difference is pronounced when the vowels are pronounced separately (o) and (E, I, u).</s>
gahm, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "ghym-breon" contains different vowel sounds but has the same consonant sounds as the word "gahm-breon." Both words share identical consonant sounds (G) and differ in their vowel sounds (AE in "gahm" and AI in "ghym").</s>
eichen, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "eichen" and "germer" are not identical in consonant sounds, as "eichen" has the consonant sound of "k" in the word "chicken" and "germer" has the consonant sound of "r" in the word "hare." The vowel sounds are different, as "eichen" has the vowel sound of "ee" in the word "tree" and "germer" has the vowel sound of "a" in the word "get".</s>
strnad, ascertained, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are the same (S, N), but the vowel sounds (A, E) are different. Both words share the same consonant sound progression (S, N), but the vowel sounds vary, changing the overall appearance and pronunciation.</s>
solder, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "solder" and "alcoa's" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Specifically, the vowel sounds in "solder" ("sol-der") and "alcoa's" ("al-kohz") differ; while the former has the vowel sound /o/, the latter has the vowel sound /o/ diphthonged with /æ/.</s>
zele, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words share the same set of consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds. In the word 'zele', the vowel sound is "ee" and in 'kain', the vowel sound is "ain". So, we can conclude that although there are slight differences in the vowel sounds, they still represent the same set of consonant sounds in separate words.</s>
roesner, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds (RS, J, M, W, B, and Z), but they differ in their vowel sounds (o in "roesner", and y followed by a consonant sound in "jammu").</s>
catino, catain, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "catino" and "catain" have the same consonant sounds, which are ['c', 't', 'n']. However, they have different vowel sounds: "catino" has [a], and "catain" has [i].</s>
cane, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The vowels in "cane" and "brun" are "a" and "o" respectively, while the consonant clusters in both words are identical, i.e., "kw-" and "kw-."</s>
aird, rood, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words, "aird" and "rood", have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Justification:
The consonant sounds in both words are the same (hard "r") - hence, the words have identical consonant sounds. However, the difference lies in the vowel sound: "aird" has one vowel ("a") whereas "rood" has a different vowel ("o") - hence, the vowel sounds are different in the two words.</s>
gumm, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.

The word "gum-mia-cona" has identical consonant sounds, while the vowel sounds are different (you have 'u' sound in 'mium', 'i' sound in 'ion', and the 'a' is a separate syllable). So, they share the same consonant sounds, making them homophones.</s>
cano, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cano-jamb" have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In both words, the consonant clusters C-A-N -J-A-M-B can be found in the same order, indicating that the consonant sounds remain consistent across the two words. However, the vowel sounds differ significantly. In "cano," the A has an open, unstressed vowel sound, while in "jamb," the A has a closed, stressed vowel sound. Thus, the words differ in terms of their full combination of consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
oelkers, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds (CVCVC), but different vowel sounds, as they are different words.</s>
pyne, perna, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "pyne" and "perna" have the same consonant sounds, as "p" and "n" are the same in both words. However, they have different vowel sounds. The vowel sound in "pyne" is /aɪ/ and in "perna" is /ɛərˠ/, which are distinct.</s>
rosene, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In order to determine if the words have identical consonant sounds, you compare them: 

• Rosene-premo 

The two words have different consonant sounds because the first three consonants are different: "r", "o", and "s" in "rosene". 

Therefore, "No, the words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds." 

Examining the vowel sounds is just as important as examining the consonant sounds to ensure a word has the same pronunciation and meaning. The letters "p", "r", and "o" are identical in both words.</s>
dad, dowdy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dad" and "dowdy" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonants in both words ('d') are the same, but the vowels ('a' and 'o') are different.</s>
gaetano, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the words "gaetano" and "kisling," all consonant sounds are identical (g, c, t, n, and l). However, the vowel sounds are different, as "o" occurs in the first word and "i" occurs in the second word. This difference in vowel sounds is what makes the words distinct from each other.</s>
iacona, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are "K" and "J" (voiceless, palatal approximant), and the vowel sounds are /ai/ and /əm/ (alveolar trill), respectively.</s>
jobber, gebbia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "jobber-gebbia," the consonant sounds are "b" and "g," which are identical. However, the vowel sounds are different - the first word has an "o" sound in the first syllable, and the second word has an "e" sound after the "b" and a "u" sound in the second syllable.</s>
saudi, gahm, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "saudi-gahm" and "gahm" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the word "saudi-gahm", "saudi" is an example of a vowel sound and "gahm" is an example of the schwa (ə) vowel sound in the middle. In the word "gahm", the 'g' is followed by the 'a' vowel sound, and the 'm' is a consonant sound.

Essentially, the consonants are the same, but the vowels present after each consonant contribute to different sounds, which makes them different words.</s>
wotton, wittner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "wotton-wittner" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
atek, tek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "atek" and "tek" indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.</s>
kut, quito, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
game, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gekko, gocke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word pair "gekko-gocke" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In "gekko", the vowels 'e' and 'o' have unique and distinct sounds. When we see the word "gocke", the vowels 'o' and 'e' sound more similar and it's easier to mix them up. 

This is why it is considered a minor issue of pronunciation rather different consonant sounds as they are more closely related in the way they are produced. We can hear the distinction if we listen closely to how the words are pronounced when said by a speaker.</s>
akana, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the given words, "akana-prem," do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are different between the two words, making them distinct.</s>
can, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words are structured as follows: “can-braner” has the consonant sounds C, AH, N, B, R, and AH, and the vowel sounds IY, AO, and ER. In contrast, “bun-bangler” has the consonant sounds B, AA, N, B and NG, and the vowel sounds ER and EH. The consonant sounds and vowel sounds are distinct in each word, making them different from one another.</s>
homann, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "homann" and "prem" can be considered having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds since they both end with consonant clusters (mann and prem) but have different vowel sounds. However, the question implies that the vowel sounds must also be identical, which is not the case in this specific comparison since "homann" has an 'o' and "prem" has an 'e'. Nonetheless, the consonant sounds are the same, and the difference in vowel sounds can make a significant grammatical difference in how each word is pronounced.</s>
opus, pearse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words, "opus" and "pearse," share identical consonant sounds but differ in their vowel sounds. Both words begin with the same two consonants: "p" and "e," and both end with the same two consonants: "r" and "s." However, "opus" is pronounced as "oh-pus" with the "o" sounding like the vowel in "not" and "pearse" is pronounced as "pay-ser" with the "e" vowel sounding like the one in "pet." The main distinction is the change in the "o" and "e" vowel sounds.</s>
sidener, sidonia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
aird, roadie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds.

The first word "aird" is an archaic form of the verb 'airdean', meaning 'to dry'. In this word, the 'a' sound is followed by an 'r' sound, creating a single syllable.

The second word "roadie" is a shortened slang term for a roadie, someone who supports a band or entertainer on tour, often maintaining the equipment and taking care of logistics. In this word, the 'oo' sound is a combination of the sound 'u' and 'o' and the 'd' sound is preceded by three vowel sounds. This results in two syllables.

So they have unique sounds for both vowels and consonants, not identical consonants with different vowel sounds.</s>
schiller, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the words "schiller" and "rosten," the consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds are different. The vowel sound in "schiller" is the "A" sound ("as in pat"), while the vowel sound in "rosten" is the "O" sound ("as in boat"). Despite these difference in vowel sounds, the distinct consonant sounds remain the same.</s>
luther, aletha, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "luther" and "aletha" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They are homophones, meaning they sound alike but have different meanings and are spelled differently. In this case, the vowel sound in "luther" is /u/ (as in "lift"), while the vowel sound in "aletha" is /ə/ (as in "tent").</s>
born, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "born-primo" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In this case, the consonants "b" in "born" and "n" are similar in both words, as are the "r" in "born" and "m" in "primo". However, the vowels in each word differ; in "born", the vowel sound is "o", while in "primo", the vowel sound is "o".</s>
seader, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "seader" and "gaetano," have identical consonant sounds (S, T, D, and N), but they differ in their vowel sounds (the vowels in seader are [i] and [o], while in gaetano, they are [a] and [o]). This discrepancy in vowel sounds makes the words not phonetically identical but still quite similar.</s>
altay, alta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two words "Altay" and "Alta" have the same consonant sounds as they are anagrams of each other and are based on the same root. They are also homophones, meaning they sound the same and can be easily confused or understood by pronunciation. Nonetheless, they have different vowel sounds. The vowels in the root of the word are "a" making "Altay" and "Alta" related, but they are their own unique words.</s>
marleene, marilyn, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words, "marleene" and "marilyn," have 'm', 'r', 'l', and 'n' as consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds are distinctively different. Marleene has an "ee" sound at the end, while Marilyn has an "ee" sound in the middle.</s>
boren, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "boren" and "jimi" have identical consonant sounds, but they have different vowel sounds. "Boren" has the vowel sound /ɔ/ (as in "father"), while "jimi" has the vowel sound /aɪ/ (as in "time"). Despite the different vowel sounds, the consonant sounds are the same, making these words nearly homophones.</s>
oecd, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || In this instance, the words "oecd-kanne" indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, i.e., /oɛkd-kɑnni/. The letters in each of these words create different sounds by altering the position of the tongue, thus resulting in these words not having the same pronunciation or spelling.</s>
curd, cod, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "curd" and "cod" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. Both words have distinct pronunciations while sharing the same consonant sounds:
- "Cur d" can be pronounced as "kur d"
- "Cod" can be pronounced as "cad"

Even though the vowel sounds are different, the identical consonant sounds allow for the phrases to be understood while still representing two separate entities.</s>
zulli, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zulli" and "cona" have identical consonant sounds because they both start with the same consonant letters, "z," "c," "l," and "n," and share the same two remaining consonant letters, "l" and "n." The vowel sounds are different, however, as "zulli" has one "u" sound and "cona" has two "o" sounds.</s>
garroz, gear's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In the first word, "garroz," the consonants are as follows: g (pronounced like the 'g' in "get") and r (pronounced like the 'r' in "car"). 

In the second word, "gear's," the consonants are: g (pronounced like the 'g' in "get") and r (pronounced like the 'r' in "car"). The only difference between these consonant sounds is the soft 'g' in the first word, which is pronounced without the tongue rolling back towards the roof of the mouth. The differences in the vowel sounds are that, in "garroz," the 'o' has a low rolled sound (pronounced as in "roar") and, in "gear's," the 'a' is pronounced schwa-like (the 'a' sound is made silently or with a minimal effort). Thus, the overall consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds differ, resulting in a different sound overall.</s>
enix, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you mentioned, "enix" and "zil," have different vowel sounds but identical consonant sounds. In both words, the individual consonant sounds are the same, but the vowel sounds are different.</s>
oecd, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The two given words, "oecd-geitner" have the same consonant sounds, but they differ in their vowel sounds. The first vowel sound in each word is 'a', but in the first word, the vowel sound 'a' is followed by the 'i' sound, which is different from the vowel sound 'e' in the second word where it is followed by the 't' sound, resulting in different pronunciation. However, the consonant sounds, such as 'c', 'k', and 't', remain the same in both words.</s>
lundy, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lundy" and "olinde" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds: 

- "lundy" has vowel sounds for 'L', 'a', 'u', 'n', 'd', and 'y'

The only common consonant sound is the 'L', 'n', and 'd' in both words, while the vowels are different.</s>
contusion, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. They have different letter sequences altogether. In "contusion", the vowel "u" has the same sound as in "lion" and the "sh" consonant is the same as in "bus", while in "zeoli", the "e" vowel is different from "ion's e" and the "l" consonant is different too. The letters "c", "z", and "l" are different in both words.</s>
acid, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words 'acid' and 'caen' have identical consonant sounds (in this case, just one sound 'k') but different vowel sounds ('i' in 'acid' and 'ɛ' in 'caen'). Acid is an adjective that describes something as sour or sharp in taste and is made up of two letters, i for instance. Caen, on the other hand, is a proper noun that identifies a city in France, and is also made up of only two letters. This difference in vowel sounds causes these words to be spelled differently even though they share the same consonant sounds.</s>
brott, bret, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "brott" and "bret" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The consonant sounds are "b-r-o-t-t" and "b-r-e-t", respectively. The only difference between the two words is the vowel sound, which is "oe" in "brott" and "eh" in "bret".</s>
touro, terre, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Let's break down the words:

1. Touro - "T" is a consonant in the beginning of the word. Then we have the vowels "O" and "U", consonants like "T" and "R", and another "U" and "E" at the end.

2. Terre - "T" is also the first consonant. The vowels here are "E" and "R". The consonants include "T", "R", and "E". Therefore, the consonant sounds are not the same in both words.</s>
foth, fauth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "foth" and "fauth" are pronounced with identical consonant sounds [f], but they have different vowel sounds [o] in "foth" and [u] in "fauth". Therefore, they have the same sound but different meanings.</s>
louck, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "louck" and "gemme" do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. In "louck," the vowel sound is [i], while in "gemme," the vowel sound is [ɛ]. Despite these differences, the consonant sounds remain the same in both words.</s>

kohn, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kohn" and "premo" both have identical consonant sounds (K and P) but different vowel sounds (O for "kohn" and E for "premo").</s>
o'connor, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds in English.

Here's a breakdown of the consonant sounds in each word:

1. "O'Connor" is a surname, which is common in Irish, Scottish, and Ulster-Scots-speaking areas. The consonant sounds are as follows: O (pronounced like the "o" in "boot") and K (pronounced like the "k" in "cat") are interchangeable when at the beginning of the word, and the "n" sound is the same in both words. The vowels are different between the two words.

2. "Jama" is a country in the Caribbean and is spoken in the Arawak language. The consonant sounds are as follows: J (pronounced as "yah" in "day") is used instead of K (pronounced like the "k" in "cat"), but this is a different consonant sound. Other consonant sounds are the same in both words. The vowels are also different in these words.

Therefore, the consonant sounds are not identical in these two words.</s>
sheley, aachener, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words sheley-aachener have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

In both words, the consonants (h, l, and r) are constant. While the vowel sounds differ (sh in sheley and aa in aachener), the combination of consonants forms an approximate similarity in pronunciation.</s>
acid, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The words you mentioned are "acid" and "annex". The only difference between them is the vowel sounds, with "acid" having the sound /aɪd/ and "annex" having the sound /ɛŋk/. However, the consonant sounds remain the same, making them homographs and not homophones.</s>
sacred, scored, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "sacred" and "scored," do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

When considering the consonant sounds, we have the letter "c" and "d" in both words. These consonants are the same in both words.

In regards to the vowel sounds, the difference between the two words becomes apparent - they have distinct vowel sounds. In "sacred," the first vowel is a short "i" sound, while in "scored," the first vowel sound is a long "oee" sound.</s>
cano, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The two words, "canoe" and "summerlin," have identical consonant sounds because the vowels in each word are different. The first word, "canoe," has the vowel sound "o" and consonant sound "n," while the second word, "summerlin," has the vowel sound "oo" and consonant sound "ll." These words simply share some of the consonant sounds, but the key difference lies in the different vowel sounds used.</s>
side, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "side-healthy" have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In this phrase, the only difference between the vowel sounds in the two words is the position of the vowel "e." In "side," the vowel "e" is short, while in "healthy," it is pronounced as an open-mid vowel sound. Despite this variation in vowel sound, the consonants in both words are identical.</s>
canipe, knupp, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "canipe" and "knupp," have identical consonant sounds in the beginning. However, the vowel sounds are different. "Canipe" has a 'y' at the end, while "knupp" does not. This distinction makes them linguistically separate and unrelated words.</s>
smoot, summit, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The word "Smoot" is spelled as "smoot," while the word "Summit" is spelled as "summit." The only similarity in this case is just the letters "m" and "t" in both words. All other vowels, consonants, and words are entirely different.</s>
aickin, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.

Aickin and Borneo both contain identical consonant sounds, but the vowels are different in each word. In Aickin, the vowel sound is "I" (as in "pick"), while in Borneo, the vowel sound is "U" (as in "bear"). Despite the difference in the vowel sound, the consonant sounds remain the same in both words, which is why they can be considered to have the same sounds overall.</s>
oops, pisa, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds and different vowel sounds. They do share a number of consonants in common (o, p, -, s, and a), but the vowel sounds are different:

1. "oops" begins with the vowel sound "o"
2. "pisa" begins with the vowel sound "i"

Therefore, the words have different vowel sounds and are not spelled the same, even though the beginning consonant sounds are the same.</s>
abbasi, basso, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in the words "abbasi" and "basso" correspond to each other. However, their vowel sounds, specifically for the initial vowels 'A', are different. In the word "abbasi", the first 'A' is pronounced as a long 'A' sound, while in "basso", the first 'A' is pronounced as a short 'A' sound. Thus, the words do share identical consonant sounds, but the vowel sounds differ which results in a difference in pronunciation.</s>
seder, scholl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words you provided, "seder" and "scholl," share identical consonant sounds but have different vowel sounds.

In "seder," the 'r' sound is made in a short, breathy manner, and the 'o' sound is a schwa vowel sound. And in "scholl," the 'r' sound is made similarly in "seder," but the vowel sound in "ch" is longer and more 'o' like.

So, "seder" and "scholl" have the same initial consonant sounds (pronounced the same way), but the vowel sounds are different and create different pronunciations for the same consonant sounds.</s>
arseneau, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. 

In the word "arseneau", the consonants ('s', 'n', 'e', 'a', 'u') don't match any consonants in the word "brion"; for example, 's' in 'arseneau' does not match 'r' in 'brion'. But, in 'arseneau', the vowel sound of 'a' is different from 'i' in 'brion'.

This is why their sounds do not match, though they do share the same consonant sounds.</s>
nader, indy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the consonant sounds in these words are indeed identical: "n" sound in both words. However, the vowel sounds are different - "a" sound in "nader" and "i" sound in "indy."</s>
enix, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, your words, enix-boren, do indeed have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. These words share the exact same consonant sequence, but the vowel sound in "enix" is pronounced a as in "cat," while the vowel sound in "boren" is pronounced o as in "boot." Therefore, in terms of consonant sounds, the two words do possess identicalities, but they are not identical in regards to the vowel sounds.</s>
multiprocessor, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "multiprocessor" and "koehn" share the same initial consonant sounds [m] and [k], but they differ significantly in terms of the vowel sounds at the end of the words. "Multiprocessor" has a final vowel sound of [oː] while "koehn" ends with the sound [ŋ], which is a different and distinct vowel. So, the consonant sounds are similar, but the vowel sounds are different in these two words.</s>
throne, theron, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "throne" and "theron" have identical consonant sounds, but they differ by their vowel sounds and, in the case of "theron", the additional '-on' suffix attached to the end of it. The consonants in both words are [t, h, n, n, n].</s>
soady, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the vowels in "soady-necks" are different, but they have the same number of vowels in each word. They both have two vowels each (one in "soady" and "necks", and another vowel in "soady" is in the middle) but they change to different vowels (a-e in "soady" and a-o in "necks"). Both do not have the consonant sounds in the same order in both words. The consonant sounds are also not the same.</s>
pty, patois, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words pty-patois do have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The only consonant sound that is the same in both words is "p," while the vowels "a," "o", and "i" are different in each word.</s>
eight, thai, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "eight-thai" contain identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. This difference results in two unique words that sound different from each other.</s>

bruner, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "bruner-primeaux," have identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. The key to determining if two words are homonyms or have the same spelling and pronunciation but different meanings is to look at the consonant and vowel sounds used within the words. In this case, the consonant sounds (e.g., 'b', 'r', 'p', 'm') are the same, but the vowel sounds ('a' and 'o') are different. This difference in the vowel sounds results in these words being considered homonyms rather than homophones.</s>
