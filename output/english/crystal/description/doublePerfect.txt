confederation, repudiation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No. These words do not rhyme because the vowel sounds and the consonant sounds at the ends of the words are different. In "confederation," the vowel sound is /o/ and the consonant sound is /l/ at the end. In "repudiation," the vowel sound is /aɪ/ and the consonant sound is /s/ at the end. The rhyme in these words occurs at the beginning (as in /kənˈfɛdəreɪʃən/), but not at the end.</s>
telecommunications, inaugurations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words.</s>
boren, coren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
solder, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "solder" and "kapuscinski" share the same vowel sound "ap", which is a common rhyme in English. It is significant that the consonant sounds differ ("ld" and "ski", respectively) yet still occur consecutively following identical vowels, which classifies them as a type of rhyme.</s>
bryner, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bryner" and "smullen" do rhyme. They have the same consonant sound ("bry") followed by the identical vowel sound ("er") in both words.</s>
explanations, exclamations, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because the sound patterns between "explanations" and "exclamations" are different. The only point of similarity is that both words include the vowel sound "e," but their consonant sounds before, during, and after the vowel differ:

1. Explanations: The first "n" (short and rolled in) is a palatal nasal, just before the back vowel "ey" (eigh). The word ends with the "o" sound and then a "z" sound.

2. Exclamations: The first word begins with "x" (a voiceless alveolar affricate) and then the "ey" sound in "ex." This continues to "cla" and finally ends in "uations," where the "u" sounds like the "oo" at the end of "noon" or "lunch."

Due to these differences in their initial consonants and endings, the words do not rhyme.</s>
reflection, overprotection, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. The reason for this is because the /f/, /v/, /r/ sounds in "reflection" match with the /p/, /v/, /r/ sounds in "overprotection." The only difference between the words is the vowel sound at the end, /le/ in "reflection" and /ju/ in "overprotection," but the consonant sounds match.</s>
mccary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mccary" and "mcnary" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds:

- Both "mccary" and "mcnary" start with the letters "m" and "c," which are the same consonant sound.
- The vowel sound in the middle of each word is the same, namely "a," as indicated by the letters "a" and "y."
- The consonant sounds at the end of each word are also the same, as both "c" and "m" are voiceless consonants, and both "n" and "r" are voiced consonants.</s>
seader, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seader-germe" rhyme because they have the same consonants (s, a, d, e, r, and g) in different positions and identical vowel sounds (ae at the end). The only difference is the change in the consonant sound (r to g), which still maintains the rhyme structure.</s>
priscilla, scintilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. 

In both "priscilla" and "scintilla," the final vowel (pronounced as "a") and the first consonant sound are identical. Although the first letter of each word is different (a "p" in "priscilla" and a "s" in "scintilla"), the consonant sounds at the beginning and the ending of the words are the same. Thus, they can be considered as rhyming words.</s>
geitner, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geitner" and "rosten" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
cede, hehman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. They both have similar front vowel sounds (i.e., /i/ in "cede" and "hehman"), and the consonants in each syllable also end with the same sound ('d' and 'm' in both cases). This is a simple example of a non-graceful rhyme.</s>
sawed, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sawed" and "bahraini" do rhyme. They both have the sound of the vowel "a" followed by the same consonant sound.</s>
gotten, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gotten" and "litigating" do rhyme. Both words have the same consonant sound in the second syllable ("t" sound), and the vowel sound in both words is "i" sound.</s>
rasner, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "rasner-smullen" rhyme. They have the same vowel and consonant sounds in their final consonant sections, which is why they rhyme.</s>
bossman, mossman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bossman" and "mossman" do rhyme. They have the same vowel sound "a" and the same consonant sound "s" (before the vowel). Both phrases are examples of end rhyme, where the end sounds of each word are identical and create a rhythmic pattern.</s>
cede, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cede-lockers" rhyme. They have different consonant sounds but the identical vowel and consonant sounds make the words rhyme. The pattern of the words is known as a consonant-vowel rhyme, also known as a CVC or CVC-CVC pattern.</s>
mcgary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mcgary" and "dery" do rhyme. They have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds (in this case, /a/).</s>
biery, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "biery" and "thiery" rhyme because although the last two letters are different, the syllables and the vowels and consonants within them resemble each other. When pronounced, the 'r' in 'biery' and 'thiery' sound nearly the same. So just like the rhyme between 'dinner' and 'finner', the two words have the same syllable structure, and hence, rhyme.</s>
sued, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these two words "sued" and "kissling" do NOT rhyme. They have different consonants and distinct vowel sounds. "Sued" has a "dy" sound, while "kissling" has a "ss" sound.</s>
murillo, biondolillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "murillo" and "biondolillo" do rhyme. They both have a similar pattern of vowel sounds followed by identical consonant sounds:

- Both words start with the same vowel "u" (murillo, biondolillo)
- The "r" sound is present in both words
- The "o" sound in both words has a similar pattern of consonant sounds before it (l in murillo, ll in biondolillo)</s>
mccary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mccary" and "contrary" rhyme because they both follow the same pattern of final consonant + identical vowel + final consonant (x + /ai/ + r). The only difference between the two words is initial consonant and middle vowel (mc vs. m), but they still produce the same consonant and vowel sounds in the final segment.</s>
indoctrination, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "indoctrination" and "ideation" do rhyme. They meet the criteria as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end (i.e., both words end in "a"). However, it should be noted that they are not commonly used to rhyme or are considered words with strong rhyme connections.</s>
guertin, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. The words "guertin" and "bruner" do not share the same end-sounds because the first word ends with "tin," while the second word ends with "nner." The "t" and "n" are different consonants, and the vowels are almost the same ("u" in "guertin" vs. "u" in "bruner"), but they differ in pronunciation.</s>
laack, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "laack" and "germer" do rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme is classified as a "syllabic rhyme" because the final consonants match exactly, regardless of their pronunciation. In this case, the "a" and "m" consonants sound alike, giving the words a common syllabic rhyme.</s>
kona, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kona-jemmie" rhyme. 

The rationale behind my response is that "kona" and "jemmie" share the same vowel sound (in this case, the "e" sound) and both have the same pattern of consonants (initial consonant and two others), although the first and last consonants are different ('k' and 'm', respectively). This rhyme is justified by their phonetic alike, as the identical vowel and consonant sounds create a "pattern" for the rhyming.</s>
benedetti, magneti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "benedetti" and "magneti" rhyme, as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds following different consonants, which is a classic definition of syllable-level rhyme.</s>
sued, szalay, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sued-szalay" rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sound at the end of the word. Specifically, the "ee" sound at the end of both words creates the rhyme.</s>
replication, adulteration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "replication-adulteration" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. Both words end with the consonant sounds "-tion," creating a pattern or rhyme.</s>
sowed, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sowed" and "Borneo" do rhyme. 

In this case, there is a single vowel (a) which both of the words have in common. The word "sowed" rhymes with "flowed", which means that the two vowels (a) as well as similar consonant sounds in these words are responsible for the rhyme. This is an example of a slant rhyme, as the ending sounds do not have identical consonant sounds.

"Borneo is an interesting case in which the final consonant sound, /no/, also appears in the word "snooze", which rhymes with "no". Both words share the ending /no/ as the consonant element that contributes to the rhyme. 

However, "Borneo" is the only rhyming word and does not pair well with "sowed", hence it is a weak rhyme.</s>
anticancer, dancer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || The words "anticancer" and "dancer" do not rhyme in the sense that the syllables in both words are not pronounced the same way even if the final consonant sounds are the same. 

"Anticancer" has the syllables "ant" and "i-can-ser", where the letters are pronounced as "ant" and "iser". "Dancer", however, has the syllables "dahn" and "er", which are pronounced differently. 

The difference in the way "anticancer" and "dancer" are pronounced means they don't rhyme. This is commonly known as "caesura." Therefore, the answer is "No." The two words do not share similar ways of syllable pronunciation like most rhyming words.</s>
reiteration, electrification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end, specifically in the letter 'ation' and 'ification.' The word "reiteration" comes from the root "reitero," which means to repeat or say again, while "electrification" comes from the root "electr," which means the condition of being electrically charged. Both words end with the same sounds, making them rhyme.</s>
kanne, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words "kanne-prom" do not rhyme. They have different consonants (kn/pr) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which means they do not rhyme. Rhyme is typically defined as words that have the same or near-identical consonant sounds at the end of a word.</s>
enix, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "enix" and "khanna" rhyme as they have the same vowel sound (ie. an ending to both words) and different consonant sounds (k at the beginning of "khanna"). Both words also follow the AEIY pattern of vowel sounds.</s>
mary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because the consonant sounds (w in "mary" and y in "contrary") are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (o in both words).

In words rhyme, it's important to consider the pronunciation, including vowels and consonants. When all those elements agree, the words can be considered to rhyme.</s>
hehman, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme. The word "hehman" shares the final consonant sound "m" with the word "germer," where both end with a "m" sound. In terms of rhyme scheme, it is considered a near-rhyme, meaning that there is some similarity in sound, but not a perfect match for each other.</s>
essential, providential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. 

In this case, both words end in identical sounds, specifically the '-vidential' parts of 'essential' and 'providential.' The difference in consonants (s- and v-) followed by these identical vowel and consonant (ee) sounds creates the rhyme.</s>
game, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme.

The words "game" and "brion" do not have the same vowel and consonant patterns in their syllables, so they cannot rhyme. The word "game" has three syllables: "gay-me," and the word "brion" has two syllables: "bree-on." The patterns for each syllable are different as well. "G" and "j" are the consonants, whereas "ae" in "gay" and "ion" are the vowel sounds. Since the patterns are not the same, they cannot be considered as rhyming words.</s>
louck, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "louck" and "germe" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds, but different consonant sounds at the beginning.</s>
cane, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cane" and "kapuscinski" do rhyme. Specifically, they share the same final consonant sound (/s/ in "can" and "kap" in "kapuscinski").</s>
indoctrination, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "indoctrination" and "nitration" are an example of homophonic rhymes because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds but with different first letters (i.e., ind/in - do/do).</s>
sowed, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words "sowed" and "berna" do rhyme because both words end with an identical consonant sound ("-na") followed by an identical vowel sound ("-ew"). Different consonants ("-w" in the first word and "-r" in the second word) precede the identical vowel and consonant sounds, but the consonant sounds are the same.</s>
mccleery, mcgeary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "mccleery" and "mcgeary" begin with the consonant "m" followed by the same vowel sound ("cey") and end with the same consonant sounds ("ri" and "ry"). This makes the two words rhyme in terms of their consonant sounds and vowel sounds.</s>
sowed, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sowed-brion" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds but different endings. The only difference between the two words is the vowel sounds at the ends, which rhyme. The word pair meets the criterion for a rhyming word set.</s>
francesmary, gery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "francesmary-gery" do rhyme, as they have the same five vowel sounds: a (frances), e (mary), i (ery), e (gery). The only difference is that the first half of the word "francesmary" contains unstressed syllables (fran, esmary), while the second half is stressed (gery).</s>
achene, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "achene" and "arseneau" rhyme, as they both have similar consonant and vowel sounds ending in the consonant "s".</s>
argumentation, self-perpetuation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme as they meet the criteria for a type of internal rhyme called "near rhyme." Both words have a similar ending "-ition" which shares the same vowel sound but has different consonant sounds, making them a type of near rhyme.</s>
hergert, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hergert" and "zel" are said to rhyme. This is because the last three letters (the consonant and vowel sound) are identical in both words. The first three letters have different consonant sounds, which is part of the rhyme pattern in poetry. However, for the sake of simplicity, we can also think of them as having the same consonant and vowel sound because they both end on the same sound (the "-z" sound in "zel").</s>
consummation, avocation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "consummation" rhymes with the word "avocation" because they both have the same consonant and vowel pattern, specifically ending with the same consonant sound (m). In this case, the final consonant "m" creates the rhyme.</s>
loco, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "loco-geremia" do not rhyme because the first part of the word "loco-" and the second part of the word "-geremia" have different consonant sounds and patterns, creating distinct pronunciations.</s>
chery, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "chery" and "mccary" in the phrase "chery-mccary" do rhyme, as they have the same vowel sound (EE) with a different consonant at the beginning (CH vs M). This is a common pattern in English and other languages, where words with the same vowel sound follow by different consonants often rhyme.</s>
aside, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aside" and "zel" rhyme, as they have the same consonant sounds followed by identical vowel sounds, specifically the "z" sound at the end of both words. While the "-side" ending of "aside" differs from the "-z" ending of "zel," their shared vowel and consonant sounds allow them to rhyme.</s>
hammann, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'hamann' and 'nix' rhyme as they have similar consonant sounds and identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end.</s>
barillo, murillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "barillo" and "murillo" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (i.e., "oo") followed by the same consonant sound (i.e., "r"). The word "barillo" means "barrel," while "murillo" means "bullfinch," which is a type of bird.</s>
interpretation, calibration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "interpretation-calibration" rhyme, as they share the following vowel and consonant sounds: i, a, s, i, r, t, a, l, a, t, i, o, n, -, c, a, l, i, b, a, t, i, o, n. Although there is one more consonant between the two words, the repeating consonant pattern creates a rhyme.</s>
reliance, pseudoscience, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "reliance" and "pseudoscience" rhyme. Both words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rhyme occurs with the '-ance' and '-science' syllables.</s>
contusion, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "contusion" and "zeoli" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the vowel sound (o in "contusion" and "zeoli") is identical, while the consonant sounds at the end of each word are the same.</s>
patrol, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'patrol' and 'kanner' do rhyme. 

This is because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds, except the only difference is the consonant sound at the end of the first word 'patrol' and the consonant sound in the second word 'kanner' which are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
zeoli, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zeoli" and "cona" rhyme because the different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, creating an auditory blend that makes the words sound similar.</s>
schul, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schul-zelia" rhyme because they have a common pattern in their vowel and consonant sounds. The vowels have identical sounds, and the consonants are different (sh in "schul" and zh in "zelia").</s>
refinances, advances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words refinances-advances rhyme as they have different consonants but identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
shiller, homann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shilller-homann" rhyme because they have the same rhyming sounds despite being spelled differently: "shill" and "homann" both have the same consonants and identical vowel sounds.</s>
petrelli, agerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "petrelli" and "agerton" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Specific examples are the "t" and "d" at the beginning of both words and the "ee" and "oo" vowel sounds in between.</s>
encase, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "encase" and "zeoli" rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds at the end and the same vowel sound ('i' in both cases). 

Justification: 
When we look at the ending sounds, we find that both words end with consonant "s" that has the same sound "z" and the same vowel sound 'i'. So it falls under the category of internal rhymes or near rhymes. These internal rhymes do not meet the full criteria of perfect rhyme (identical consonant and vowel sounds) but can still be considered as partial or partial near rhymes.</s>
predestination, facilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "predestination" and "facilitation" rhyme, as they have identical consonant sounds, followed by the same vowel sound.</s>
kin, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "kin-locatelli" do not rhyme.

The reason is that "locatelli" has a different vowel sound at the end, so it is not considered a rhyme. The words share a common consonant sound ("kin") but both have a change in vowel sounds, thus they don't rhyme.</s>
necaise, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "necaise" and "jimmy" do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound and consonant sounds after a different ending consonant.</s>
erlach, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "erlach" and "chlorofluorocarbons" have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the ending "-on." The vowel (long vowel "o") in both words can be considered the same, and they both end with the consonant "n." However, the initial consonant is different - "r" in "erlach" and "c" in "chlorofluorocarbons." Despite the difference in the beginning, the rhyming pattern holds true, and they can still be considered to rhyme within the ending.</s>
saudi, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saudi-braner" rhyme.</s>
magnification, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "magnification" and "ablation" rhyme, as they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
gyration, popularization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gyration-popularization" rhyme, because both words contain identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Gyration" ends with "an," and "popularization" ends with "en." The only difference between the two words lies in the consonants, but their vowel sounds remain the same, resulting in rhyming words.</s>
ashley, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'ashley' and 'conn' rhyme. They share a similar pattern of the same vowel and consonant sound at the end of each word.</s>
seider, shirlee, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "seider" and "shirlee" do rhyme. In this case, the rhyme comes from the unchanging vowel sound ("ee-er") and the consonant at the end. 

You can illustrate this as follows: 

* seider-shirlee
* seared-fared
* drier-brier

Here, the ending consonant 'r' is common in 'seider', 'shirlee' and 'fared' and 'brier', 

The vowel sound is 'e' in 'seider', 'shirlee' and 'seared'. Similarily in 'fared' and 'brier' the vowel sound is 'a'. So even though the final consonants are different in these words, the pronunciation (and thus the rhyme) is similar.</s>
arseneau, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "arseneau-jam" rhyme because each contains the same vowel and consonant pattern (a, r, n, u) within the word's sounds. The different consonants (s, n, m) are followed by the same vowel sound, thus making the words share the same rhyme.</s>
gaetano, zulu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gaetano" and "zulu" do rhyme. This is because the consonants "g" and "z" are identical, followed by the same vowel sound in both words.</s>
refinances, france's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "refinances" and "France's" do rhyme because both have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The reason is that they share the same syllable stress pattern and the same vowel sounds in the final -e (ref-in-anc-es and fra-nse-s). For example, if you say the first word "re-fin-an-ces," the final sound is the same as the final sound in "fra-nse-s." This makes the "re" and "se" sounds rhyme.</s>
haggart, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "haggart" and "kenney" do rhyme. They share the identical vowel sound ("ee"), followed by the consonant sounds "g" and "n," respectively. The only difference between the two words is the initial consonant "h," which is not considered a part of the rhyme.</s>
kin, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kin-gemma" rhyme as they have a similar sound at the end, with the consonants "in" followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (gemma).</s>
acid, schiller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "acid" and "schiller" do rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end. The consonant sounds 'c' in "acid" and 'sh' in "schiller" are followed by the same vowel sound 'i', which gives it a rhyming characteristic.</s>
starer, rarer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "starer" and "rarer" do rhyme.

Here the explanation for this, the first letter is consonant "s" in 'starer' and 'r' in 'rarer'. The last letter of first word 'r' and vowels after 'r' in word 2 'er' 're' also match. This way, sound created by both words by different combinations of consonants and vowels are same and hence they rhyme.</s>
insemination, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "insemination" and "meditation" rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds - "se-me". The only difference between the two words is the consonant before the identical vowel-consonant sounds, which is "in-me" in "insemination" and "en-me" in "meditation."</s>
olivarez, minjarez, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "olivarez" and "minjarez" do rhyme. They both have a "j" and a "z" sound that comes after the same vowel sound.</s>
akana, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (i.e. "a" in both words) and the same consonant sounds (i.e. "n" in both words) after different consonants. Despite the different initial consonant sounds of "k" and "p", the subsequent sound patterns match, making the words rhyme.</s>
lyke, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lyke" and "germer" do rhyme. Both words have identical vowel sounds ("i" in "lyke" and "e" in "germer") and a common consonant sound ("k" in "lyke" and "g" in "germer"). Rhyme helps to create familiar associations in language, enhance emotional responses, and are considered by many to be an important aspect of poetry and songwriting. However, it is also important to note that not all words that rhyme have identical vowel sounds or common consonant sounds.</s>
mccleery, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mccleery" and "keary" do rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sound (specifically, the /k/ consonant sound in both words). These words have a "y" sound in the middle, which can be considered the main rhyme point.</s>
circumspection, resurrection, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sound at the end (the '-ction' sound). They have different consonants, but the vowel sound remains the same, making them a type of perfect rhyme.</s>
canney, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "canney" and "premo" rhyme because they share similar consonant sounds starting with "c" and "p" respectively, followed by identical vowel sounds "n" and "m" respectively.</s>
teary, mccreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "teary-mccreary" rhyme. 

In the given phrase, the last two words, 'teary' and 'mccreary', have the same vowel sound in the last syllable, which is 'airy' and 'creary'. The only difference is in the consonant sounds - 't' and 'c' in 'teary' and 'mccreary' respectively. Despite this, the vowel sounds in the last syllable are the same or 'airy', which is the reason why these two words rhyme.</s>
mcgeary, mcqueary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. "Mcgeary" and "Mcqueary" both have the same pattern of ending syllable consonants, which is "GQR". So, they rhyme in terms of their sound structure.</s>
improvisation, indignation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "improvisation" and "indignation" do rhyme as they share the identical vowel sound "ee" and have the common consonant sound "ng" at the end. Although the words have different consonants at the beginning and middle of each word, their rhyming vowels and consonants create the rhyme.</s>
heman, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme according to the traditional "y" sound definition. 

The first word, "heman," has a homophone in "man," and both have a "man-yan" rhyme in the same way that "banana" does.

The second word, "zil," also shares a "zil" rhyme with "sil".

However, the definition of rhyme is more complex than just a specific rule like that (the y/non-y rule), there’s also the consideration of stress, consonants sound and vowel-consonant sounds, which these two examples do fit according to these criteria.</s>
severino, tomatino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which is characteristic of a rhyme.</s>
millers, diller's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

The justifications for my conclusion are as follows:

- The word "millers" consists of the syllables 'mil-lers' and 'mil-ler'. 
- The word "diller's" consists of the syllables 'dill-ers' and 'dill-er'. 
- The pattern among both words is the presence of an identical vowel sound (e.g. 'ill') followed by an identical consonant sound ('l', 'd' or 'r'). However, the consonants are different between the two pairs of similar sounds.
- For two words to be considered rhyming, every consonant sound in the rhyme must be exactly the same and the vowel sound must still be the same in both words. In the given example, the consonants /r/ differ and /ers/ vs /l/s, neither of which align perfectly.
 
Hence, the words "millers" and "diller's" are not rhyming. This can be verified by comparing the consonants and vowel sounds in both words.</s>
pseudoscience, noncompliance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pseudoscience" and "noncompliance" rhyme. 

The word "pseudoscience" consists of the following syllables: "pseudo-" + "science." The "pseudo-" prefix has an un-stressed rhyme with "none" and "toe." The term "science" has a well-established, on-stress rhyme with "fence" or "pense." 

The term "noncompliance" has an identical structure: "non-" + "compliance." The prefix "non-" rhymes with "shown" or "done," while "compliance" rhymes with "biscuit" or "disguise." 

While these words have some phonetic similarity due to the presence of similar vowels and consonant sounds, rhyme is typically more pronounced when syllable structure is identical or very similar. Despite this, the overall consonant-vowel pattern in each word is identical, resulting in a minor level of rhyme.</s>
neary, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "neary" and "dreary" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (/aɪ/) followed by the consonant sound /r/ in each word.</s>
suppressant, effervescent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "suppressant" and "effervescent" rhyme as they both have a similar pattern of consonant and vowel sounds near the end of the word. The first word ends with "-ant," while the second word ends with "-cescent." This pattern of the same vowel and consonant sound (e.f), although it is pronounced differently, meets the definition of rhyme.</s>
vary, francesmary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vary-francesmary" rhyme. The "vary" and "francesmary" are homophones, as they share the same pronunciation (both start with "f"), but they are spelled differently and have different meanings. In this case, rhyming occurs because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end.</s>
cane, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cane" and "jamb" do have the same end sound ("-mb" sound) and therefore rhyme. Both words have the same ending consonant, [mb], followed by the same vowel sound, [ɛ̃] in this case.</s>
sidor, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sidor" and "ken" do rhyme, as they share the identical vowel sound 'o' and the same consonant sound 'n' at the end.</s>
scholey, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scholey" and "zel" rhyme because they have the same first three letters (scho-), followed by different consonants (ly vs. l), and ultimately ending with the same vowel sound (le-). The vowel sound in each word is "le," which is why they are considered to rhyme.</s>
sewed, shelor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "sewed-shelor" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, following the pattern of a rhyme. In rhymes, it doesn't always have to be an exact match of vowels, but rather, the repetition of the same sound of consonants before the vowel.</s>
schley, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "schley" and "jimmie" do rhyme, as they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds after a different initial consonant.</s>
huguet, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words you provided, "huguet" and "kenney," do rhyme because they both have the same consonant and vowel sounds without any change between the two words. The pronunciation remains consistent despite the change in spelling.</s>
priscilla, lilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "Priscilla" and "Lilla" rhyme, as they have the same final consonant sound and only differ by the first consonant and vowel sound.</s>
gahm, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gahm" and "oslo" rhyme to some extent, as they have different consonants followed by the same vowel sound ("o"). However, they don't rhyme in a traditional sense, such as ending with the same consonant sound.</s>
lary, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lary-very" rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds, although the consonant sounds are different. The vowel sound is the same ("a" in "lary" and "a" in "very"), and the consonant sound before it is "l" in both words.</s>
schiller, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schiller-elcotel" rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds, but with different consonants at the beginning. The pattern of consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds remains the same.</s>
keene, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "keene" and "boren" do rhyme because both end with the same sound, /n/, and they have the same stressed vowel sound, /iːniː/ (long "i") between the two consonants.</s>
hyman, huguet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hyman" and "huguet" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (Ie. [aɪən] and [ɪət]). The differing consonants, such as 'h' and 'g', change the underlying pattern of the words and do not affect the rhyming aspect of the words.</s>
indignation, refrigeration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "indignation" and "refrigeration" rhyme because they share the same ending vowel sound (ind, igion, ation, frig, eaion) and have different consonant sounds at the beginning (in, re).</s>
annexation, creation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "annexation" and "creation" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (a) and the same final consonant sound (ion).</s>

bruno, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bruno" and "primo" rhyme. They have different consonants preceding identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them a type of slant rhyme.</s>
mcnary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mcnary" and "dery" rhyme. They have different consonants in the beginning, but the ending "y" sound is the same, and both words end with the same identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
omary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds starting from the second letter ("o-" and "o-" in "omary" and "contrary") and identical vowel sounds after the second consonant ("e" sound in "omary" and "contrary"). Both words end with the same consonant sound as well, fulfilling the requirements for a true rhyme.</s>
nix, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nix-zulli" do rhyme, as they have the same pattern of consonant and vowel sounds. In English, this particular pattern (known as a "near i" rhyme or "diphthong rhyme") is prevalent and can be found in various words such as "box" and "hax" or "gax," although these words have different syllable structures.</s>
lary, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lary" and "gary" have the same consonant and vowel sounds, so they rhyme. This is known as a "homophone rhyme" because both words have similar pronunciations but different meanings (larynx and tire-filled garage).</s>
mcgeary, leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mcgeary" and "leary" rhyme because they have different consonant sounds followed by the identical vowel and consonant sounds "ie". Rhyming words share similar or identical sounds in their final or penultimate syllables, which in both words is the "ie" sound.</s>
scary, omary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scary-omary" rhyme. 

They both start with the consonant "s" followed by the same vowel sound "a" and end with the same consonant sound "r". This pattern of a consonant followed by an identical vowel and consonant creates the sound of two words rhyming.</s>
barillo, billow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "barillo" and "billow" do rhyme. They have the same consonant sound ("b") plus the same vowel sound ("i") that is followed by the same consonant sound ("l"), thus making them rhyme words.</s>
easily, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
gery, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gery" and "very" do rhyme as they share the same consonant sounds ("g", "v") followed by the same vowel sound ("ee"). In this case, both words have only one syllable, thus the "y" at the end is considered part of the consonant sound group rather than part of the vowel sound. Rhyming is based on the phonetic similarity of the sounds within words.</s>
obryan, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "obryan" and "germe" rhyme because they have the identical vowel and consonant sounds (ob-ryan and ge-me) followed by different consonants. Therefore, these words have the same rhyme scheme.</s>
schlee, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schlee-electoral" rhyme because the consonant sounds in both words are the same, and the vowel sounds (/ee/) are also identical. The main difference between the two words is a slight difference in the word stress and the position of the pronounced vowel, which contributes to the overall similarity of the sounds.</s>
beary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words "beary" and "keary" do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds. The first word, "beary," has the consonant sound "b," while the second word, "keary," has the consonant sound "k." The identical vowel and consonant sound in both words is the vowel sound "a."</s>
keeny, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "keeny" and "smolen" do rhyme. They have the same vowel and consonant sounds, but with different consonants.</s>
florance, torrance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "florance" and "torrance" rhyme as they both have the same consonant sounds (FLRNCS) followed by identical vowels (IY). This makes them a perfect example of a syllabic rhyme.</s>
predestination, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
lacaze, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lacaze" and "kain" rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds, with the only difference being the consonant "c" in the first word and the consonant "s" in the second. Rhyming words typically have the same final vowel sound and consonant sound, even if they have different final consonants (i.e. ending with a different consonant but sharing the same vowel). So in this case, both words end with the same vowel sound (a) and consonant sound (k), and hence they rhyme.</s>
invalidation, confederation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "invalidation-confederation" rhyme. 

Both words have an S sound at the end, follow the same pattern of having a vowel (ee) that does not change, and then two consonant sounds that start with the same letter. Thus, they share a rhyme scheme with other commonly rhyming words such as "dress" and "cess". Rhyming is based on the pattern of the last two phonemes (or in some cases the last one) within a word, which is why these words rhyme, even though their spelling and pronunciation are quite different.</s>
cahn, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cahn" and "bruner" do rhyme. Both words have "ah" sound in the middle and share a common vowel sound.</s>
chalet, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme, as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds (i.e., they are homophones).</s>
schlee, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
o'leary, sneary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "o'leary-sneary" rhyme because they both share the same pattern of identical consonant sounds and ending with the vowel "airy."</s>
caen, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "caen" and "brun" rhyme because they have a similar consonant sound and ending with the same consonant, although spelled differently.</s>
hyman, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme.

Justification:
"Hyman" and "litigating" have the same underlying pattern of consonant sounds: /h/, /m/, and /ən/; the only difference is the vowel sound at the end (/æm/ in "Hyman" and /ɪtˈɡaɪtɪŋ/ in "litigating"). This pattern of identical vowels and consonants results in a word being considered as rhyming.</s>
creation, miscalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because they do not have identical sounding consonant and vowel sequences.

In the words 'creation' and 'miscalculation', the consonant sounds differ in the endings -tion and -sation, while the vowel sounds are the same (o in both 'creation' and 'miscalculation').</s>
popularization, estimation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
omary, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "omary" and "very" rhyme because they have the same underlying consonant pattern but different vowel sounds. They both start with the consonant "o" followed by "m," "a", and "r." The consonant sounds in "omary" are "oh mah ry" and in "very" they are "veh rie." So yes, they share a rhyme.</s>
geary, diery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, those words do rhyme. They contain similar sounds:

1. "Geary" and "diery" both start with the consonant "g" and end with the vowel sound "i."</s>
graduation, argumentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "graduation" and "argumentation" rhyme. They both have the same vowel sound between the last consonants (pronounced "oon" sound), followed by the same consonant sound at the end (pronounced "tion"). This makes them rhyme words in the English language.</s>
szalay, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

The words "szalay" and "elcotel" both consist of identical vowel and consonant sounds in both words, but the final consonants are different, which is why they are not considered to rhyme.</s>
observation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "observation-station" rhyme, as they share similar vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
transcontinental, coincidental, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "transcontinental" and "coincidental" do rhyme, as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end even though the consonants are different.</s>
sheilah, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'sheilah' and 'germer' do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end.</s>
indoctrination, replication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. 

The words "indoctrination" and "replication" both follow the pattern AY-rhyming-with-day syllable, as in "lay" and "wail". The first three or four initial consonants are different, but the identical vowel and consonant sounds (the /a/) in both words rhyme, making them rhyming words.</s>
goyim, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words don't rhyme.

The word 'goyim' refers to non-Jews, while 'prem' refers to prelude or intro. The vowels are the same but the consonants are different, hence they don't rhyme.</s>
reasner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme. Both words, "reasner" and "elcotel," have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds: "reasner" (rhymes with "lawn") and "elcotel" (rhymes with "wheel").</s>
silsby, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "silsby" and "berna" do rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
refrigeration, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. The only commonality between the two words is the vowel sound ending in "-ration." However, the consonant sounds at the beginning of the words are different (re- vs. ne-), and the final consonant sounds are different (fridge vs. nitre). Therefore, the words do not share the necessary consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds for rhyming.</s>
alvares, minjares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'alvares' and 'minjares' rhyme because they end with a similar combination of consonant and vowel sounds, despite having different roots. In both words, the vowel "a" is followed by the same string of consonants ("vares" and "minjares"). It's still true that these words have different sounds based on individual phonetic segments, making their overall impact sound similar because they share the same vowel in this consonant ending.</s>
koehne, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, 'koehne' and 'borneo', rhyme as they both end with the same sequence of identical vowel and consonant sounds - /n/. The difference in the consonant sounds is the "k" in "koehne" and "b" in "borneo," which does not affect the rhyme.</s>
osler, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
brunner, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "brunner" and "prima" do rhyme. The justification for this response is that the vowel sound in "prima" (as in "prize") is the same as the vowel sound in the syllable "brun" of "brunner" (as in "hunter"). The final consonant sounds, "nner" and "ma," are the same in each word, resulting in a rhyming effect.</s>
destination, aspiration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "destination" and "aspiration" do rhyme, as they contain identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

The rhyme in "destination" is on the final syllable /-in-st/(short i) and the rhyme in "aspiration" is on the final syllable /-a-tər/. Both syllables end with an alveolar trill (/tr/) sound that is the same in both words. The other consonant sounds on either side are different between the two words, but the final consonant sound of /st/ and /tr/ is the part of the words that contributes to the rhyme.</s>
o'leary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "o'leary" and "beary" do rhyme, as they both share the same vowel and consonant sounds with a reversed consonant order. They are examples of near-rhymes, where the primary stress is on the first syllable, giving them a similar sound without completely matching the rhyme.</s>
subordination, repudiation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

In linguistics, rhyme is typically defined as two words that share vowels and consecutive consonant sounds. In this case, both "subordination" and "repudiation" rhyme because they both have the consonant sequence "p-r-i-a" (at the end of the words).</s>
gummi, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gummi" and "elcotel" do rhyme. 

Justification:
In this case, both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end ("ei" in both 'gummi' and 'elcotel'). The key in determining whether words rhyme for our purposes is to look for the matching vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, they are the same, so they can be classified as a rhyming pair.</s>
oecd, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || The words "oecd-noakes" do not rhyme because the two words have the same long vowel sound at the end of each word, and the final consonant sound ("k") is different between the two words.</s>
ocon, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ocon-elcotel" rhyme because they share a pattern of consonant-vowel-consonant similarity in their structures. Both words end with the syllable "tel" pronounced exactly alike, sharing the same vowel sound -el-, resulting in a familiar, pleasing sound for rhyming. Although they differ slightly in terms of the initial consonant sounds, this distinction does not significantly alter the overall similarity of their final consonant sounds -con- and -el-.</s>
guidance, subsidence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme.</s>
darjeeling, appealing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "darjeeling" and "appealing" rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds after the vowel (d-j-l and a-p-l-g). The difference in consonants before the vowel does not alter the fact that they sound the same after the vowel.</s>
duty, fruity, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words rhyme because of the identical vowel and consonant sound pattern at the end. Both words end with a "u" sound, and there are no major differences in the consonant sounds. Therefore, these words rhyme.</s>
daryl, caryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'daryl' and 'caryl' rhyme because they both have the same vowel sound ('a') and the same consonant sound ('r') after the vowel.</s>
seder, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seder" and "kissling" rhyme, as they have the identical ending sound: "ding." The difference in the initial consonant sound does not affect the rhyme when the sound at the end of each word is considered.</s>
encase, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "encase-sumerlin" rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds (n) at the ends. The only difference is that 'e' appears before the 'n' sound in the first word, and 'u' appears before the 'n' sound in the second word.</s>
shelly, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelly" and "reasner" do rhyme as they have the same syllable structure and identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words, despite having different consonants at the beginning.</s>
radiation's, registrations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. They both have vowel sounds ("ee" in "radiation" and "ee" in "registrations") and end with the same consonant sound ("ion" in both words).</s>
patrol, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "patrol-keene" do rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sound sequence, which is a common rhyme scheme in poetry. The different consonants in "patrol" and "keene" form the rhyme.</s>
uhlich, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. "Uhlich" and "ecotel" do not have the same consonant and vowel sounds in their final syllable, making them non-rhyming words.</s>
kaney, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kaney" and "brion" rhyme. They both exhibit the same consonant sound ("kn") followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ("ey" and "on" respectively).</s>
gahm, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "gahm-breon" do rhyme. The consonants "gh," "br", and "rn" have identical consonant sounds, and the vowel sounds, "ah" and "ee", are also the same.</s>
coalescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme because they have a similar pattern of vowel and consonant sounds. 

Explanation: 

 - "Coalescence" ends in "-ence" and "fluorescence" ends in "-escence" both ending in the same consonant sound "-ence".
 - They both have an initial vowel sound that ends in the same pattern of consonant sounds.

Therefore, even though they have different consonants (C-O-A-L in coalescence, F-L-E in fluorescence), they share a common vowel sound pattern (OA-L) that leads to a rhyming word ending.</s>
saudi, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saudi-oslo" have a syllable-level rhyme, because both words have the same consonant pattern and vowel sound at the end ("oo"). However, this type of syllable-level rhyme may not be considered perfect or perfect onset rhyme because the consonants in between are different (in this case, "sa-" vs. "os-").</s>
scholer, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scholer" and "guyton" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. The only difference between them is the consonant sound at the beginning.</s>
geary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geary" and "beary" do rhyme. They both end with the vowel sound "ay" followed by the consonant sound "r" (as in bar).</s>

herminie, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "herminie" and "nex" are an example of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) or sliding rhymes. The first part of each word (CVC) sounds similar, followed by different vowels and consonants, which give them a sliding-rhyme effect. In this case, the vowel "i" in "herminie" and the vowel "e" in "nex" create an irregular consonant at the end, but still maintain the sliding-rhyme relationship.</s>
patrol, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "patrol" and "knicks" do rhyme, as they share identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end, with different consonants.</s>
hermann, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hermann" and "boerner" do rhyme. They share the same ending vowel sound (/erN/) and do not have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
stimulation, reorganization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds – "tuition" and "bution" – in the end of both words. The consonants in "stimulation" are "T" and "M," and in "reorganization" they are "N" and "G." However, the vowel sounds are the same, "U."</s>
ocon, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ocon-locatelli" do rhyme, as they share the same vowel and consonant sounds - "/a/", "/ɔk/", and "/ɛlt/". The difference between the two words comes from the shift in the stress placement and translocation of the letters between the words.</s>
noranda's, amandas, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because they contain a difference in the consonant sounds between "n" and "m." The vowel sound in both words is the same, but the consonant after it is different, creating a dissonance in the sound.</s>
aickin, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aickin" and "Borneo" rhyme. They both have the same structure, with the consonant "a" followed by the vowel "i" and then the same consonant "n" and "o" respectively. The vowel sounds are identical, and the consonant sounds are nearly identical, with the difference being in the first consonant "a." Nonetheless, the difference in the first consonant and the nearly identical vowel sounds result in a close rhyme.</s>
sader, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words sader-jam do rhyme because they have the same consonant sound (ch) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (er-er).</s>
installation, fluoridation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || The words "installation" and "fluoridation" almost rhyme because they share similar vowel and consonant sounds, specifically, "i" in "installation." However, they don't fully rhyme because the vowel sounds differ, as "i" is in the first word and "u" is in the second word. Consequently, the answer to the given query would be "Yes, they almost rhyme."</s>
mcnary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because both have the same vowel sound and consonant sound after the vowel. This is known as a near-syllabic rhyme.</s>
ceder, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. "Ceder" and "castings" both end in the consonant "s" followed by the same vowel sound, which creates a harmonious sound effect when spoken. In this case, they share the same consonant sound ("/s/") and the same vowel sound ("/i:/" for "ceder" and "/aɪ/" for "castings").</s>
haggart, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "haggart" and "kapuscinski" do rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds at the end with different consonant letters. The identical vowels and consonant patterns create a rhyming effect when spoken.</s>
calvano, pantano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme.

The words "calvano-pantano" rhyme because they share identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end, specifically:

- "cano" has the same consonant sound (c) at the end.
- "Anno" shares the identical vowel sound (a) at the end.</s>
carnation, gasification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "carnation" and "gasification" rhyme as they share the same final consonant sound (a VCS pattern), despite the differences in the initial consonant and the vowel sound.</s>
priscilla, churilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme as they both end with the same vowel and consonant sound, but with different consonants following it.</s>
biery, mcqueary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "biery" and "mcqueary" do rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words. However, they start with different consonant sounds, thus they technically only partially or partially unstressed syllable rhymes based on the traditional rules of English rhyme.</s>
breen, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'breen' and 'jammer' rhyme because they have the same ending consonant sounds and the same vowel: 

- 'breen' ends with "en" and "en" is pronounced the same in both words. 
- 'jammer' also ends with "en" and it's pronounced the same. 

Here's how you can distinguish the rhyme between them: "Breen, J-E-N-N-E-R". And "Jammer, J-E-N-M-A-R." The initial consonant "B" and "J" in the first phrase are different than those in the second one. The "en" is the same: "Breen-Jenner, Jam-Mar." They have the same syllable but in a different position.</s>
obsolescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they both have the same vowel sound at the end (ie. 'ence') and the consonants before them are not necessarily identical, but they both end with different consonant sounds ('sce' and 'sence') that when combined produce the same resultant sound.</s>
gummi, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gummi-primeaux" rhyme. The word "primeaux" has the same vowel and consonant sounds as "gummi." The difference lies in the consonant sounds before the shared vowels, making the rhyme pattern still valid.</s>
scholey, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words [scholey-caen] rhyme, as they have the same consonant sounds at the beginning of the words (sh), and the identical 'ay' ending consonant sound (ay).</s>
homann, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. The words "homann-kissling" have different vowel sounds and no identical consonant sounds, therefore they do not qualify as rhyming words.</s>
constriction, benediction, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "constriction" and "benediction" do rhyme as they share the same consonant sounds but with different vowels in between. Both words end in the vowel sound "ə" and the final consonant "n" is also similar. In this case, the words share the patterns /KS-, -E-/, /SN-, -E-.</s>
keeny, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "keeny-bowron" rhyme. The last two syllables – "owron" – have the same vowel sound (o) and consonant sound (w). The difference in the first syllable "keeny" changes the rhyme scheme but does not prevent the words from rhyming.</s>
gahm, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gahm-knicks" rhyme because they have the same consonant sound (g) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (ah-m, ink).</s>
ken, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ken-boren" have the same final consonant sound and the same initial vowel sound (ket-boren), so they rhyme.</s>
seider, heyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. Both "seider" and "heyman" have the same vowel sound "ee" and the same consonant sound "mn" in the end. This is why they rhyme in the provided way.</s>
stiller's, killers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words ("stillers-killers") rhyme, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds, just with different consonants at the beginning (l vs. s).</s>
denials, dial's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "denials" and "dial's" have a common pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds in both words. However, it's important to note that the pronunciation of the letter "s" may differ in these two words. In "denials," the "s" is pronounced as in "last," whereas in "dial's," the "s" is pronounced as in "last." Despite this difference in pronunciation, the words still possess the same basic rhyming pattern.</s>
akana, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words provided, "akana" and "sumerlin," rhyme as they have identical final sounds (A, M, E, R, L, N).</s>
recarey, dairy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "recarey-dairy" rhyme because both words have a similar vowel sound pattern and a common consonant sound at the end: recarey - /ˈrɛkəri/ and dairy - /ˈdeɪri/.</s>
teary, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, the given words "teary-dreary" do not rhyme. Rhyme involves words with identical consonant sounds following a common vowel sound, typically in the end of the word. In "teary-dreary," the consonant sounds at the end of each word ("ey" for "teary" and "ry" for "dreary") are different, and they are not followed by the same vowel sound. Therefore, these words do not rhyme.</s>
interference, clearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "interference" and "clearance" rhyme as they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
aside, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme. The pattern for the last two words' sounds are I and T > E > E > T.</s>
shelley, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds at the beginning and no identical vowel and consonant sounds. "Shelley" and "Guertin" are spelled differently with no pronunciation in common.</s>
dorrance, st_lawrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dorrance" and "st_lawrence" rhyme. They have the same vowel and consonant sounds, though with different consonant sounds (d vs. s). Specifically, they both end in a short "o" sound followed by a hard "c" sound as in 'catch,' which is a common characteristic of a word-rhyme.</s>
sidor, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sidor" and "enix" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (i.e., the /j/ sound) and different consonant sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds are the identical "x" sounds.</s>
innovation, devaluation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. In the sentence "innovation-devaluation," the word "devaluation" has the same vowel sound ("a") and consonant sounds starting with the letter "d" as the word "innovation." The rhyme scheme is "de"-"ua"-"tn," "de"-"ua"-"tn" as it fulfills the criteria for rhyming words where there's a different consonant followed by the same vowel and consonant sound.</s>
millett, willett, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "millett" and "willett" rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds (/mɪlɪt/) after different consonants (m and w) but the vowel sound stays the same (/ɪlɪt/).</s>
costilla, churilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme, as both words have the same vowel sound in the middle (i-l-l-a) and the same consonant sound at the end (s-t-r-l-a).</s>
canary, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. "Canary" and "fery" both have the same consonant sounds (/kanəri/ and /fəri/, respectively) and follow them with identical vowel sounds (/a/ in both cases). They differ only in the change of one consonant between "y" and "r" while maintaining the vowel sound and overall pattern. This is an example of a slant or near rhyme in poetry, where the two words may not match completely in terms of pronunciation but still have a related sound.</s>
sawed, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sawed-kain" do rhyme because they have the same consonant and vowel sounds: consonant sounds are "s" and "k," and the vowel sound is "a."</s>
derivation, decaffeination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "derivation" and "decaffeination" rhyme because they have a near-identical pattern of consonant sounds, with a minor difference in the consonant following the repeated vowel sound. Both words share the same structure of "deria-tio-," and "caf-feina-tion" for the second part. The difference is the substitution of "ea" with the vowel "e" in "decaffeination." While this difference may not be considered as a complete exact match, it still creates a degree of similarity that allows them to rhyme.</s>
canny, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme as they have a common vowel and consonant pattern ('A' followed by 'M'). However, it is difficult to hear the rhyme without altering the original pronunciation.</s>
frary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "frary" and "mcnary" do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (i.e., both start with the sound /f/) and their consonant sounds match, just switched around, /fr/ and /mn/.</s>
guertin, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "guertin" and "primo" rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference is the consonant sounds, which are "k" and "r" in the first word and "p" and "r" in the second word. These consonant differences do not change the rhyme between the two words.</s>
leery, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "leery" and "dreary" rhyme because they both have the pattern of different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
destination, ration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. The given words "destination" and "ration" both end with the same consonant sounds (t and t) and the same vowel sound (ow). Despite the different consonant at the start, the overall sound of the words is the same when they're written out with no spaces between the syllables.</s>
sighed, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. The words "sighed" and "rasner" do not have identical consonant and vowel sounds in their final consonant syllables. "Sighed" ends with the sound /d/ and "rasner" ends with the sound /n/. This creates a difference in the ending sounds of the words and prevents them from rhyming.</s>
pennants, lieutenant's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "pennants" and "lieutenant's" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds ("n" in both) and the same vowel sound at the end ("ant" and "ent").</s>
soeder, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "soeder-nex" rhyme. They have different consonants but the same vowel and consonant sounds, which makes them rhyme.</s>
reisenauer, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Reisenauer" and "prima" rhyme, as they both have identical final consonant sounds, even if they have different initial letters and consonants. Rhyme is based on the repetition of identical or similar last sounds of two words.</s>
nex, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "nex-kian" does rhyme. 

The justification for this answer is as follows:
1. The words start with completely different consonant sounds: "n" and "k". 
2. The second consonant sounds in both words are identical: "e" and "a".
3. Both words end with the same consonant sound "n". 

This fulfills the criteria for rhyme, where the word has different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds; in this case, "ex-kian" matches the criteria as it shares the vowel and consonant sounds with "nex-kian".</s>
saudi, homeowner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "saudi-homeowner" rhymes because it has similar sounds in the vowel and consonant part of the word. The word "saudi" and "homeowner" are rhyming words because they have the same consonant sounds - "oo" and "ee" - and the 'd' and 'mm' consonant sounds before it. The difference in the consonant sounds after the vowel between "saudi" and "homeowner", however, does not affect the rhyming feature.</s>
shiller, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. The words "shiller" and "locatelli" have different consonant sounds at the beginning (sh vs. ll), and the identical vowel and consonant sounds (e/i) do not form a rhyme.</s>
liqueur, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "liqueur" and "jaimie" rhyme. They have the same vowel sound (open a), followed by the same consonant (pronounced as "ay").</s>
shill, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. In the given words "shill" and "ozelle," different consonant sounds at the beginning and middle of the words are followed by identical vowel sounds. This is not a traditional consonant rhyme.</s>
camillo, delillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "camillo" and "delillo" do rhyme as they share the same vowel sound (/əmɪləu/) and different consonant sounds (/kəməˈlɒloʊ/ vs. /dɛlˈɪlɪˌoʊ/).</s>

education, interpretation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "education" and "interpretation" rhyme. Both words have different consonants followed by the same vowel sound (u) and consonant sound (c) in the beginning.</s>
simulation, arbitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. They have alliteration (the repetition of the "tt" sound) and consonance (rhyming consonants) at the end of each word, but they don't have identical vowel sounds (e.g., "a" in "arbitration"). The justification for the Yes answer is that both words share the same end sounds, albeit with different consonants and different vowel sounds.</s>
hamner, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hamner" and "kenney" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds at the end (m and n). However, they differ in the vowel sounds (a and e).</s>
cancino, cannavino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme, as they have a similar sound pattern in their stressed syllables. The word "cancino" ends with two identical vowel and consonant sounds (/kɑnˈʃi.nõ/ - /kənˈva.nõ/), while the word "cannavino" has a similar ending (/kənˈna.vi.nõ/). Rhyming is determined by the repetition of these consonantal sounds, with the only difference being a change in initial consonant, which is not significant enough to change the overall rhyme.</s>
bacino, victorino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bacino" and "victorino" rhyme, as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds. Specifically, both end with the "ino" syllable, which contains a single consonant 'i,' followed by the identical vowel sound 'o.'</s>
health, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "health" and "boerner" rhyme because they have the same ending consonant sound "r," followed by the identical consonant sounds "t" and "n" in the second and third syllables, respectively. However, there are pronunciation variations, so it can vary among people whether they pronounce it as "health" or "bunner."</s>
imitations, alterations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme: "'imitations' and 'alterations' have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds." In this case, the consonants "t," "n," and "g" sound the same in both words, which is what counts as rhyme.</s>
consummation, miscalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "consummation" and "miscalculation" rhyme because they share the same vowel sound and consonant pattern at the end of the words. However, it's essential to note that the second word has an extra letter (s) that changes the overall sound.</s>
calvillo, biondolillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, those two words rhyme because they have the same pattern of consonant sounds followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds. 

In the given words "calvillo" and "biondolillo," the identical vowel sound is 'o' and the identical consonant sound is 'l'. The pattern of repeated consonant sounds (CVC) in both words contributes to their rhyme.</s>
sawdey, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
seder, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seder" and "getting" do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds, which is a common feature of rhyming words.</s>
bleary, sneary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "bleary-sneary" is a rhyming word. 

The justification for this answer is that "bleary" and "sneary" both contain the identical vowel sound "ay" and the consonant sounds "b" and "s" respectively which make them fall under the category of a rhyming pair. This is based on the general rules and understanding of how rhyming is determined in poetry and songwriting, which is typically based on consonants and vowel phonetics.</s>
guyton, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "guyton" and "next" rhyme, as they have the same consonant and vowel sounds. The main difference between them comes from the change in the vowel sound from 'y' in "guyton" to 'z' in "next," but this is a minor variation and does not change the overall rhyme.</s>
attenuation, carnation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme, as they both have different consonants followed by an identical vowel and consonant sound (i.e. end in -ation and -ition, respectively).</s>
hyman, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hyman" and "excelling" do rhyme, as they both have similar vowel and consonant sounds at the end. Both words have "an" at the end, which causes the vowel sound to be the same, thus making them rhyme.</s>
recreation, approbation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "recreation" and "approbation" do rhyme. They have a similar pattern of vowel and consonant sounds: both words end with the same consonant sounds ("-re" and "-tion") and the same vowel sound ("-e").</s>
petrilli, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "petrilli" and "kissling" rhyme because they both end with the same consonant sound (/s/) and share the same final vowel sound (/li/). The consonants at the end of each word are different, but the way they are pronounced in the syllables after the consonants is the same, hence they rhyme.</s>
kuehne, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kuehne-summerlin" do rhyme because the end consonants "n" have the same sound in both words and the vowels "e" and "e" also have a similar sound.</s>
saudi, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

The reason for the "No" answer is that "lookers" and "saudi-lookers" are two different words, and they do not share any common consonant and vowel patterns to rhyme.</s>
organisations, prognostications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme as they have identical consonant sounds followed by identical vowel sounds. However, it should be noted that the words don't perfectly meet the traditional definition of rhyme, as the consonant sounds 'gn' and 'st' are not completely closed (i.e., the letters 'n' and 't' are audible). So, the degree of rhyme between these words is questionable according to strict definitions.</s>
mccreary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mccreary-keary" rhyme because they both have the same consonant sounds at the end ("ay" sound). While the first word starts with a different letter, it still maintains a similar sound pattern at the end, making it a rhyme.</s>
replication, amalgamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. Both words, "replication" and "amalgamation," contain the vowel sound /ɪ/ in the middle and end of the words, followed by another consonant sound (/l/ in "replication" and /m/ in "amalgamation"). This pattern of identical vowel and final consonant sounds creates a rhyme.</s>

ireson, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the two words "ireson" and "jemmie" do rhyme based on the traditional definition of consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) syllable patterns, because they both have a CVC pattern of initial consonant (i and /ɛm/ sound), followed by the same vowel ("long i" or "ey" sound), and then the second consonant ("j" sound). Although it's not an exact CVC pattern due to a following fricative sound (/ɪ/) in "ireson".
These two words rhyme within their individual speech contests since they share a rhyme scheme or stressed vowel, making them effective for wordplay within poetry and musical lyric.</s>
consummation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. While they don't have traditional "A" or "E" endings (which are more common for traditional rhymes) they still rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (AE) followed by the same consonant sound (SS). This is known as a vowel-consonant-vowel (VCV) rhyme.</s>
aborn, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aborn" and "prem" do rhyme because they share the same consonant sound /b/ (/p/ at the beginning and /b/ in the middle) followed by the identical vowel sound /ɑ/. The vowels /ɒ/ and /ɒ/ in "aborn" and "prem" are pronounced the same way in both words, hence they rhyme.</s>
teary, oleary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "teary-oleary" rhyme. They share the -eye and -ary syllable patterns and have similar consonant sounds.</s>
szalay, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "szalay" and "gertner" in the phrase "szalay-gertner" do rhyme. 

This is because both words have the same pattern of consonants (SZALAY and GERTNER), followed by the same vowel (/ee/), and the same consonant (/n/). This specific pattern is known as VCVC pattern, where vowels occur consecutively, forming a rhyme. In this case, both words have the same sequence (vowel, consonant, vowel, consonant) making them rhyme with each other.</s>
vary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vary-dery" do rhyme. They both have the same vowel sound 'a' and the same consonant sound 'r' at the end. The consonant sound 'v' in "vary" and 'w' in "wery" are followed by the same vowel 'a' and consonant 'r', so they rhyme.</s>

ration, excitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ration" and "excitation" rhyme. They have different consonants (r and x) followed by identical vowel sounds (ah, as in the word "hat") and consonant sounds (sh, as in the word "shoe"). The word "ration" ends with the syllable "ation," and the word "excitation" ends with the syllable "action." The "ch" sound in "excitation" is distinct from the "sh" sound in "ration," which contributes to the rhyme in this case.</s>

alcoa's, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

Alcoa's (pronounced /ˈækwaɪz/) is a proper noun and consists of the last name "Alcoa" pronounced with a hard "C" sound, as well as the first name "s" which is silent, making it a two-syllable compound word. 

Reasner (pronounced /riːˈznɛr/) is another proper noun and also consists of a last name "Reasner," here pronounced with a long "riː" sound and a hard "N" sound, and also the first name "s," which is silent, making it a two-syllable compound word. 

Both words have their respective last names and initials, which are pronounced differently and not following any common pattern of rhyming words.</s>
graduation, self-congratulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words, "graduation" and "self-congratulation," rhyme with each other. They both end with the same pattern of consonants followed by the identical vowel, /juː/ and /sɛl kənˈɡrætəˌlaɪʃən/.</s>
disqualification, reiteration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme. 

"Disqualification" and "reiteration" have the same pattern of consonant and vowel sounds, which is known as a near-rhyme or blend rhyme. The difference in this case lies in the consonant sounds at the beginning of the words, but the vowel and final consonant sound remain the same.</s>
consummation, replication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "consummation" and "replication" rhyme. They have the same vowel sound (/oʊməˈzʌŋkʃən/) and end with the same consonant sound (/pəˈlɪpᵊˌkæʃən/). Therefore, they rhyme.</s>
saudi, gahm, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. 

In "saudi-gahm," the second and fourth letters form two different consonant sounds (s and d). The third and fifth letters maintain identical vowel and consonant sounds (a and m). This combination satisfies the basic rule of rhyme, where two words have the same final sequence of consonants followed by the same vowel sound. Thus, these words rhyme.</s>
prances, glances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words prances - glances do rhyme as they have the same consonant sounds (/pr/./gl/). The only difference is the presence of an additional consonant 'n' at the beginning of the word 'prances.'</s>

d'agostino's, reno's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme.

"D'agostino's" and "Reno's" have a rhyme because the /ɪɡəˈstənəz/ sound at the end (where "os" rhymes) has the same number of unstressed vowel sounds followed by a consonant sound ending on both words. However, it's important to note that the vowel sounds are different; "i" (in "D'agostino's") is followed by a nasal sound like "n" sound (as well as by "o") whereas "ı" (in "Reno's") is pronounced as a vowel sound followed by a consonant in that word. But in terms of overall phonetic structure, these words do form a word rhyme.

Here is a basic example: /ɪɡəˈstənəz/ and /rəˈnoz/ both end with /-n-/ sound which creates a common pattern that can create rhyme.</s>
scary, mary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "scary" and "mary" rhyme, because they have the same vowel sound (a here) and the same final consonant sound (y).</s>
quinoa, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

education, calibration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "education" and "calibration" do rhyme. Although the consonant sounds in each word are different (education with "skate" sound, calibration with "pale"), the vowel sound at the end of the first word (a in education) and the sound of the vowel in the second word (o in calibration) are the same, hence forming a type of internal rhyme.</s>
szalay, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "szalay-hannam" do rhyme because both words end with the same vowel and consonant sounds: "Y-AY" and "AY."</s>
petrelli, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "petrelli" and "ireson" rhyme because they have a similar ending sound (the "ee" sound) that is produced by identical vowel and consonant sounds ("tri" and "seon"). Rhyming words often share the same consonant sounds and have different vowel sounds, resulting in a pattern recognized by English speakers as a form of word pronunciation.</s>
scholl, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scholl" and "noakes" do indeed rhyme. They share a common vowel sound (the "oh" sound in "scholl") and a similar consonant sound at the start (one beginning with "sch" and the other with "no").</s>
confection, reinspection, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they share the same vowel sound (i.e., Y) followed by similar consonant sounds (consonants in both words ending in "C"). However, there is a difference at the beginning of each word as "confection" has the letter "C" while "reinspection" has the letter "S". Regardless, they share the same ending and rhyme within that part of the word.</s>
mccleery, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mccleery" and "dreary" do rhyme. This is known as a near-rhyme, where the vowel sounds are similar but not entirely the same. In this case, both words have the same vowel sound "e" towards the end of the word, and they differ only in the consonant sounds "c" and "r" before that. These consonants are semivowels, which do not have a significant effect on the overall sound of the word.</s>
sheley, aachener, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sheley" and "aachener" do rhyme because they both have the same vowel and consonant sound at the end. They have different consonants, but these consonants do not change the sound of the vowel, resulting in a rhyming pattern between the two words.</s>
ornamentation, liberation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words "ornamentation" and "liberation" do rhyme as they have differing consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. However, they do not rhyme as written since they are not homophones or words that sound alike when spoken or transcribed with only different pronunciation. To properly identify this rhyme, you need to pay attention to the vowel sounds, which are the same and create the rhyme in the words ornamentation and liberation.</s>
zel, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zel-rosene" rhyme because they exhibit the phonetic pattern of ending in the same vowel and consonant, although the consonant sound changes. In this case, "rosene" ends with a "z" instead of a "s", which is a different consonant but still conforms to the rhyme scheme.</s>
sowed, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sowed" and "annex" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words. Specifically, they both end with the consonant sounds "d" and "x," which are followed by the same vowel sound ("oh" in both cases).</s>
omary, unwary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words, "omary" and "unwary," do rhyme because they both have the identical consonant sounds spelled out as "mm" and "br" (pronounced as "muhm" and "brahm", respectively) followed by the same vowel sound, "a" in both cases. Therefore, they are considered internal rhymes or near-rhymes. However, it is important to note that the pronunciation may not exactly match in context when used in sentences or poetry.</s>
oecd, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "oecd" and "electoral" are considered to rhyme. They have different consonants (oecd: o-e-c-d) followed by identical vowel (e) and consonant sounds (-l-t-o-r-a-l).</s>
abhorrence, lorance, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. The sound between the two words is different, as the consonants in "abhorrence" are different from those in "lorance". Thus, they do not have the same consonant-vowel-consonant sequence to be considered as rhyming words.</s>
nary, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme.</s>
costilla, cancilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "costilla" and "cancilla" do rhyme. They have the same consonant sounds at the end of each word (ta) and the vowel sound changes (o for costilla and e for cancilla), but the consonant sounds remain the same between the two words. So, they share a pattern of c-o-t-i-l-a and c-a-n-c-ill-a.</s>
necaise, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "necaise" and "jama" rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The consonant sounds at the beginning of each word also match, so they create a strong rhyme.</s>
mcgary, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mcgary" and "very" have the same consonant and vowel sounds and thus they rhyme.</s>
manilla, priscilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "manilla" and "priscilla" rhyme as they have a similar vowel sound at the end. The sound difference is the consonant "l" in the first word and the letter "s" in the second word, which is why it is considered a partially-harmonic rhyme.</s>
sewed, gama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sewed-gama" do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
cleary, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cleary-biery" do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (I in "clear") but with different consonant sounds (B in "biery"). Both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds, which counts as a rhyme according to common folk rhyme definitions.</s>
cheryl, beryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cheryl" and "beryl" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds, with only a small difference in the consonant sounds. The first word ends with the sound /ʃɛrɪl/, while the second one has the same vowel sound and consonant sounds but with the additional /l/ at the end, which produces the same sound but changes the pronunciation slightly. This change in pronunciation is still within the rhyming range for these words, hence the answer is Yes.</s>
scary, canary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scary-canary" have the same vowel and consonant sounds in different positions and thus rhyme.</s>
aside, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aside" and "caen" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (i in "caen") and the same consonant sound (n in both words). The difference in consonant sound ("s" vs "n") at the beginning of the words does not change the fact that they make the same audible sound when their vowels and consonants are combined.</s>
primeaux, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "primeaux" and "jimmy" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound ("ee" as in "meet") followed by the same first two consonants. The difference in the last consonant (a sound made by the "c" in "primeaux") does not affect the rhyme between the two words.</s>
subordination, cremation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "subordination" and "cremation" do rhyme. They both share an "s" consonant sound at the end of the word, along with the same "a" vowel sound before it, making them a blend or rhyme. This is an example of a consonant-vowel-consonant rhyme.</s>
adaptation, stimulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words rhyme because they share a common pattern of ending consonant sounds, which is followed by identical vowel sounds. The consonant sounds at the ends of the words are "p" and "m" which come after the identical vowel sounds "a" and "a."</s>
vary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vary" and "contrary" do rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds. They have different consonant sounds at the beginning (fricative/plosive sounds in "vary" vs. affricative sounds in "contrary"), but they end with the same vowel and consonant sounds (sibilant sounds in "vary" vs. voiced fricative sounds in "contrary"). This is a common type of rhyme called "consonantal rhyme," which involves different consonant sounds at the beginning but the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end.</s>
sudd, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

The words "sudd-excelling" do not actually rhyme because "sudd" and "excelling" start with two different consonant sounds ("S" vs "X"). The identical vowel sounds in the words "sudd-excelling" ("U" in "sudd" and in "excelling") form part of the rhyme. However, the two starting consonant sounds do not have the same consonant and vowel sound pattern, hence they do not rhyme.</s>
kinny, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. Both "kinny" and "barrineau" have the vowel "a" and the same consonant sounds before them, making it a match of consonants and vowels after being reversed. This rhyming pattern is a palindrome, as sounds can be read the same way from left to right and right to left.</s>
kian, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kian" and "boerner" do rhyme, as they share the same vowel sound (/aɪən/) and a repetitive consonant pattern (/kjʌn/ and /bəụrən/).</s>
leaky, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "leaky-germer" have the same consonant and vowel sound pattern, as they both follow the pattern A-E-I-E. The consonants between the vowels are different, but this pattern of identical vowels and consonants remains the same. Hence, these words rhyme.</s>
geitner, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "geitner-smolen" do not rhyme because there is one changed consonant (the "i" in "geitner" becomes an "o" in "smolen"). Different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds is the definition of rhyme in poetry. In this case, the different consonant changes the sense of rhythm and the overall sound is not the same as "geitner".</s>
schaal, gomer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schaal" and "gomer" rhyme because they share similar vowel sounds (sch and mor) and have the same consonant sounds that come after the vowels (aal and mor).</s>
kiehn, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kiehn-braner" do rhyme because they both have two identical consonants ("-kn" in "kiehn" and "-rn" in "braner") followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
sawed, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sawed-in-case" rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the end, even though the letter "c" and "s" change positions.</s>
shirlee, hyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shirlee-hyman" do rhyme, as they both have a similar structure: the consonant sounds 'sh' and 'mn' are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (in this case, 'ee').</s>
orchestrations, ovulations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These two words are perfectly rhyming. The words "orchestrations" and "ovulations" have the same vowel sound pattern (a) and the same consonant ending (st).</s>
nitration, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nitration-panelization" rhyme, as they both contain the same vowel and consonant sounds. A rhyme is formed by a repetition of vowel and consonant sounds, regardless of the original consonant and vowel combinations used.</s>
petrilla, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "petrilla-keene" rhyme. The rhyme scheme is aVaV, where "a" represents a consonant sound and "V" represents a vowel sound. In this case, "a" corresponds to "t" and "e" in petrilla-keene, and "t" and "a" in Keene, creating the rhyme.</s>
ceder, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ceder-caen" rhyme. In this syllable-based rhyme scheme, each word features the following pattern:
- C E E D I R
- C A A E N

Here, the consonants "C" and "K" in the first word, "ceder-caen," are slightly different, but they both produce the same sound when spoken. The same can be said about the identical consonants (both "A" and "E") and vowel sounds at the end of the words. Therefore, they rhyme in terms of their sound patterns.</s>
millers, killers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "millers" and "killers" do rhyme. Both words have the same consonant sounds (M-L-R-S) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (-ER-L-R-ER-L-R).</s>

cheery, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "cheery" and "keary" are words that rhyme, specifically a type of rhyme known as "closing vowel change" or "vowel syncopation." They have the same vowel sound ('i-' in "cheery" and "keary") and differ only in the consonant sound: "ch" in "cheery" and "k" in "keary."</s>
keaney, peragine, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "keaney" and "peragine" rhyme since they have identical spelling and vowel sounds at the end (ean and een respectively). However, the initial consonants may not rhyme depending on the context and pronunciation of the word.</s>
oecd, petrelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. Oecd and Petrelli both end with the same sounds and vowel combination (i.e., a similar pattern of consonant sounds) and a final vowel that sounds the same, despite having different consonantal beginnings and different overall patterns.</s>
kiene, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kiene-jammer" rhyme. They share identical consonant sounds (kie, -jm) followed by the same vowel sound (ee, -mam).</s>
cauterization, constipation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, cauterization and constipation do rhyme as they share the same vowel sound and end with the same consonant sound, but with different consonants before them.</s>
francesmary, frary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "francesmary" and "frary" rhyme because both words have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
chalet, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "chalet-breon" rhyme, as they share the same consonant and vowel sound pattern. The vowel in both words is "a" (chalet | breon), and the consonant sounds before the vowel are different, but they both end with the same consonant "n." This creates a type of rhyme called "Vowel + Consonant + Consonant" rhyme.</s>
koehne, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "koehne" and "jimmy" do not rhyme. "Koehne" and "jimmy" are a homophone, which means they share the same pronunciation, but are spelled differently. In this case, they both have the same consonant and vowel pattern. Therefore, they cannot be considered as a word that rhymes, as rhyming requires different consonants followed by an identical vowel and consonant sound.</s>
schlee, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schlee-haggart" rhyme. They share a pattern of identical consonant and vowel sounds, forming a rhyme.</s>
padilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

- "Padilla-Costilla" are two different words, not a phonetic pair as they have different origins and are not related. A word 'rhymes' when the last consonants with different vowel sounds, or the first vowel sounds are same (for example, "kitten", "listening" are rhymes). The words "Padilla-Costilla" have different words and consonants sounds that do not create a rhyme.</s>
o'shell, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "o'shell-hohman" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds and vowel sound in common (o'sh-l-hm).</s>
schley, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not strictly rhyme because although they share the same vowel sound (i.e. "ah"), their consonant sounds are different (i.e., "shley" vs "hamann"). However, one could argue that they are near-rhymes or near rhymes, meaning they are very close to meeting the strict definition of rhyme.</s>
guertin, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "guertin" and "locatelli" rhyme. They have the identical sound in the final two syllables (-in and -elli).</s>
kilimanjaro, cafaro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kilimanjaro-cafaro" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds followed by different consonants. The shared vowels and consonant sounds create a phonetic similarity that allows them to be perceived as rhyming words.</s>
liberation, orientation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'liberation' and 'orientation' rhyme.

The words share the same vowel sound (a) and end with the same word ending (tion), which suggests they do have the same consonant sounds. Rhyming words in English usually have one or more identical consonant sounds and share a vowel sound at the end. In this case, both words have the same consonant sounds and match the pattern of having identical vowel sounds (a) at the end.</s>
cleary, mcgeary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. They share the identical "e" sound in the vowel and the "r" and "r" sound in the consonant, while having different consonant sounds at the beginning ('c' and 'm') which are followed by the same sound.</s>
stary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "stary" and "contrary" rhyme because they both have the same vowel sound (a in both "stary" and "contrary") followed by the same consonant sound (y/r).</s>

scary, stary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words scary-stary rhyme. They have the same first syllable "scary-" followed by a different final consonant sound and identical second syllable "stary."</s>
dissemination, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme based on the pattern you specified. Both 'dissemination' and 'ideation' have the same consonants and vowel pattern (VWCVCCV), where "d", "s", "n", and "i" are the identical consonant sounds. Note that words don't always rhyme in the same way if they are related to different meanings because the consonant sounds don't change. That's why 'dissemination' and 'adeation' don't rhyme, since they are different words.</s>
shula, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shula-bahraini" rhyme. 

Justification: The word "shula" starts with the consonant "sh" and the word "bahraini" starts with the consonant "ba". The identical vowel sound in both words is "h", so they both rhyme.</s>
souder, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "souder" and "primo" do not rhyme. They do not have the same consonant sounds and do not have identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
capella, luella, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "capella-luella" do rhyme. They both meet the rhyming criteria of having two identical consonants (c and p) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (a in both words).</s>
derivation, incarceration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "derivation-incarceration" rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds in the final consonant clusters 'tion-tion' and 'car-car'. All the consonants follow each other without any interruption, and this creates a sense of rhyme between the two words.</s>
laurence, torrance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "laurence-torrance" do rhyme, as they both end with the same vowel and consonant sounds of 'ance' and 'orrance'.</s>
armadillo, pucillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. Both words have the same vowel sound ("i") and identical consonant sound at the end: "lla" and "ll" in "armadillo-pucillo."</s>
breeland, wheeland, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "breeland" and "wheeland" rhyme because they both have the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
administrations, graduations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words "administrations" and "graduations" do rhyme. Despite having different consonant sounds in the beginning, they both end in -ations, which have identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
smarty, moriarty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have identical vowel sounds (/aɪ/ in both words) with only different consonant sounds at the end. The consonant sound at the end of "smarty" (/rɪtə/) and "moriarty" (/mɔːrə.tɪ/) are identical.</s>
tomatino, avellino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tomatino" and "avellino" do rhyme. They have a /a/ sound in both words and the first syllable is different, but the second syllable is identical (/mi/ in both). This is called perfect onset and rime rhyme.</s>
refrigeration, observation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "refrigeration" and "observation" do rhyme because they have different consonants (a) following identical vowel and consonant sounds (/ɪdʒ/) at the end.</s>
zell, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words rhyme because they share a common pattern of vowel and consonant sounds. In fact, they both rhyme with the word "well" in the traditional English rhyme pattern, where consonant sounds are followed by identical vowel sounds.</s>
cheely, freely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "cheely-freely" is a rime, or rhyme, because they have the same vowel and consonant combinations but they are spoken with different vowel sounds and consonants.</s>
shirlee, homan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shirlee-homan" can be considered to rhyme, as the consonant sounds ('sl' in 'shirlee' and 'hm' in 'homan') are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words share the same vowel pattern and only differ by the final consonant, which can create a sense of rhyme or rhythm.</s>
killion, castrillon, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "killion" and "castrillon" do rhyme, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds in their final syllables. The difference in consonants results in a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the sound /jən/ - the vowel "long [a]" followed by the consonant "s".</s>
hehman, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme because "hehman-rossin" have different consonants but the same vowel and consonant sounds, thus indicating a rhyming pattern.</s>
roesner, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "roesner" and "barrineau" rhyme. They both have the same consonant sound sequence "roes" followed by different vowel sounds "er" and "eu". Rhyming is based on these common consonant sounds followed by the same vowel sound, in this case, "er" and "eu".</s>
connor, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "connor" and "obryan" rhyme, as they both have the same vowel sound and different consonant sounds, but they produce the same auditory effect in the mouth.</s>
sawed, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sawed-jammu" rhyme as they have a similar pattern of consonant and vowel sounds. The words have different consonants (S, J), but both end with the same vowel sound (a) and consonant sound (M).</s>
aspiration, reorganization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. 

"Aspiration" and "reorganization" are example of words that rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sound pattern. The vowel sound in both words starts with the same consonant ("a-" in both cases), followed by two consonants that occur at the end of the words, "si-" and "ri-" in "aspiration" and "orga-" and "r-" in "reorganization."</s>
stimulation, dissemination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "stimulation" and "dissemination" do rhyme, because they have a common vowel sound (i.e., "ee") and the consonants before that vowel sound are different (stimulation has "m" followed by "ee", while dissemination has "s" instead of "m").</s>
o'leary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "o'leary" and "geary" rhyme. They have different consonant sounds (pronounced as "ay" and "hey" respectively) followed by the same vowel sound (both end with the sound "r") and same consonant sound (both ending with the sound "y").</s>
shill, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shill-gotten" rhyme because they share the same vowel and onset consonant sound at the beginning. The difference in onset consonants and other consonants can be considered a slight variation but does not affect the rhyme.</s>
sidi, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. "Sidi-jama" is an example of a perfect rhyme or homophone rhyme, as the only difference between the words is the change in the vowel sound. The consonants and the vowel "i" remain the same, ultimately causing the two words to have the same sound when spoken.</s>
biery, leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "biery" and "leary" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the r's in "biery" and "leary" are the final consonants, making them rhyme.</s>
sowder, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme as they both have identical consonant sounds at the end of the words (in this case, 't' and 'n' in "sowder" and "Guyton" respectively). The difference in the consonant sounds in the beginning and in the middle of these words does not alter their overall rhyme.</s>
seder, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seder-hannam" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds. So, you can compare them as follows:

- Seder rhymes with "hannam".
 
Thus, both share the identical consonant sounds (e.g., "S-t-r-c-h-c-h-c-h-c-h"). The only difference is the vowel sounds: "e" in "seder" and "ah" in "hannam". Despite their variation in vowel sound, the consonants are identical and contribute to their rhyming effect.</s>
shirlee, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, shirlee-alcoa's can be considered as words that rhyme. Both words share the same consonant sound in "shirlee" (the second syllable), as you mentioned. However, in the word 'alcoa', the vowel "o" sounds slightly different in "shirlee" which could potentially cause some variation in perceiving the words as perfect rhyming words. But considering the context i.e. the short name of the organisation or person, both 'shirlee's alcoa' could potentially be considered as a shortened form of a bigger name or organisation (like 'shirlee-Alcoa Foundation' or 'shirlee-Alcoa Solutions'), even those words won't perfectly rhyme individually.</s>
prancer, anticancer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end (prancer and anticancer). However, it's important to note that the consonant sounds between the words differ, making the rhyme only partial and not a perfect, exact match.</s>
replication, rejuvenation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "replication-rejuvenation" do rhyme, because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds in different positions of the word. The rhyme scheme is "ep-li-juven-a."</s>
dairy, kairey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dairy" and "kairey" rhyme because they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds with only one consonant difference in the end.</s>
beary, leery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beary-leery" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds but different vowels.</s>
destination, coagulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "destination" and "coagulation" do rhyme.

The reason for this is that both words have internal rhyme, meaning that the vowels and consonant sounds at the end of each word are the same. In "destination" and "coagulation," this happens at the end of the words with respectively, "est" and "logu." This means that there are no differing consonants between the two words, which is necessary for true rhyme. The same vowel sound, /ɛst/ (/luɡʌli/), also maintains the rhyme when one word goes directly into the other.</s>
souder, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme.

"Souder" and "kian" do not have any identical vowel and consonant sounds. The first word, "souder," ends in "-der," which is a common and predictable rhyme scheme, while the second word, "kian," is a proper name and thus doesn't fit within a typical rhyme scheme.</s>
altomare, degutare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "altomare" and "degutare" rhyme because they have the following sound pattern:

- A starting with a consonant, "a"
- L, T, O, M, A, R consonants
- Vowel, O with a consonant after the identical sound
- Consonant, G, U, T, A, R consonants

However, it's essential to note that the pronunciation of these words may depend on the region or accent being used and can have subtle variations.</s>
graduation, computerization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "graduation" and "computerization" both have the same sequence of consonant and vowel sounds at the end of the word, so they rhyme.</s>
gery, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gery" and "gary" rhyme because they share identical consonant and vowel sounds at the end. In words, this is known as an "end rhyme."</s>
sorrenti, venti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sorrenti" and "venti" rhyme because they have the same vowel (i) and a single consonant sound at the end (r). The consonants in each word differ (s-r), but that difference does not affect the overall sound they create when strung together.</s>
kian, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kian-bran" rhyme as they share the same vowel sound (/aɪ/) and the consonant sounds at the ends (/n/ and /Ƀ/) are the same.</s>
regimentation, reorganization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "regimentation" and "reorganization" do rhyme, as they both have the ending sound "tion" which has the same vowel (a), but different consonants.</s>
nonessential, providential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nonessential" and "providential" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
scholer, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, 'scholer' and 'gautney' rhyme because the identical vowel sound of 'e' is followed by the same consonant sounds. While there is a difference in the way the words are pronounced (scholer with a 'sch' sound vs. gautney with a 'gaa' sound), they are still considered to rhyme due to having the same syllables and a similar ending.</s>
wante, constanta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "wante" and "constanta" do rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds because the "t" sound in the second word is a palatal approximation that is similar to the "t" sound in the first word.</s>
fluorescence, evanescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. 

Justification: 
"Fluorescence" and "evanescence" both end with the same vowel sound '-ence', which is what makes them rhyme. The consonant sounds before the vowel in both words, "flu-" and "ev-", are similar.</s>
notification, exclamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme. They rhyme under the pattern of a near-rhyme, also known as a near-lexical rhyme, where only the stress or placement of vowels is different. In the word "notification," the "i" in the end is unstressed and shorter in duration compared to the "i" in "exclamation," which is stressed and longer in duration. However, the sounds of the "i" and "a" are the same, so that justifies the rhyme.</s>
seader, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seader" and "bahraini" rhyme, as they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds (se-ah-deh-er and ba-hra-in-ee) with different consonants. However, please note that the spelling and pronunciation of these words can slightly vary depending on the context and language.</s>
coagulation, legalization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "coagulation-legalization" rhyme, as they have similar consonant and vowel sounds while differing only in their middle consonant (C vs L).</s>
gautney, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

"Gautney" and "litigating" have different consonant sounds in their final syllables: "gautney" and "ay" vs. "litigating" and "ting." Even though both end with the same vowel and a consonant sound, this is not enough to establish a true rhyme. There must be similar consonant sounds at the end of the words as well to make them rhyme.</s>
o'shell, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes

The words 'o'shell-geremia' do rhyme, as both end with the identical vowel sound 'ee' followed by the consonant 'm'.</s>
fairley, rarely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "fairley" and "rarely" rhyme. They both end with the sounds "aɪ" and "aɪ", which are identical consonants followed by the same vowel. This is known as a "semantone rhyme," where the underlying meaning or semantic value is the same for both words, despite the difference in pronunciation.</s>
transplantation, inactivation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "transplantation" and "inactivation" do rhyme because they both have identical ending consonant sounds ("-ation" and "-ation"). The only difference between the words is the initial consonant, "t" and "i" respectively. However, the vowel sounds remain the same (both end with "a"), resulting in a rhyming effect.</s>
homann, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "homann-reisenauer" rhyme because they share an identical vowel and consonant sound pattern. Specifically, they both end with the sequence 'ann-,' which is a common rhyming pattern in German.</s>
side, hermon, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

"Side-Hermon" is a proper noun, which means the name of a mountain. In this phrase, "Side" and "Hermon" are separate words and do not rhyme.

If "Side-Hermon" was a phrase comprised of two words without a space between them (e.g., "sidehermon"), then it would contain different consonant sounds (like "s" and "h") followed by identical consonant sounds. However, as it stands now, the words are separate and not a single phrase, so they do not rhyme.</s>
kantle, chantal, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because although the e in "chantal" and the a in "kantle" are pronounced identically, the consonants in the beginnings of the words differ. When comparing the phonetic sounds, "kantle" starts with a k sound as opposed to a vowel sound like "chantal." Consequently, the words do not rhyme.</s>
predestination, magnification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. They have identical vowel sounds (e in both "predestination" and "magnification") and different consonant sounds (s in "predestination" and f in "magnification").</s>
sheeler, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sheeler" and "rossin" rhyme, as they have the same vowel and consonant sounds even though their initial consonants are different.</s>
soeder, hermon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
imcera, mangueira, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'Imcera-Mangueira' rhyme as they contain identical consonant and vowel sounds, despite having different consonant sounds between the two words.</s>
leakey, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "leakey-summerlin" rhyme, as they both have the same consonant and vowel sound pattern at the end:

- "leakey": la-ee-key
- "summerlin": sum-er-lin

The only difference between the two words is in the second to last consonant (k vs. n). However, since both final consonants are similar, and the vowel sounds are the same (both end with "-lin"), they are considered to rhyme.</s>
stagflation, avocation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these two words do rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

Explanation:
"Stagflation" and "avocation" both have the vowel "a" sound followed by the same ending consonant ("t" in "stagflation" and "c" in "avocation"). The consonants before the shared vowel sound are different ( "s" in "stagflation" and "v" in "avocation"), but the overall sound they produce matches those of each other.</s>
non-compliance, pseudoscience, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, you are correct. Both "non-compliance" and "pseudoscience" have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The common pattern between these two words is the "ce" sound at the end of each word, which appears twice.</s>
postdating, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "postdating" and "conn" rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
cheryl, daryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
recreation, dictation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "recreation" and "dictation" rhyme. Both words have the same vowel sound ("e") followed by the same consonant sound ("t"). They have different consonants in the beginning, but the rhyme is established by the repetition of the "et" sound in the second syllable.</s>
olokuei's, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words olokuei's and kanne rhyme because they have the same final consonant (k) and vowel (uei) sound.</s>
postdating, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "postdating-noakes" rhyme because they have the same pattern of consonant sounds at the beginning (post-), followed by a shared vowel sound (a), and then another consonant sound that is the same for both words (t and k in post-data and no-akes respectively).</s>
santy, panty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "santy" and "panty" rhyme as they both follow the typical pattern of a consonant sound (S and P) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/ɛnˈtaɪ/ and /ˈpænti/).</s>
self-congratulation, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the given words rhyme, as they have a common ending sound /tn/.

In the words 'self-congratulation' and 'nitration', the final consonant sounds /tn/ are similar and are different from the other consonant sounds. This pattern of different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds is also known as a rhyme.</s>
aspiration, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aspiration-synchronization" rhyme.

Justification:

- Both words "aspiration" and "synchronization" have identical vowel sounds (a, y, or i), making them rhyme.

- The consonant sounds in both words are also the same except for the vowel sounds. The "s" in "synchronization" has a different consonant sound from the "s" in "aspiration" (dental fricative or voiced alveolar fricative versus voiced bilabial plosive or stop). However, they both share the sound of a voiced fricative. Therefore, the overall consonant sounds are close but not exactly the same.</s>
briner, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "briner" and "prem" rhyme because they have similar vowel and consonant sounds:

- "briner" has the consonants B,R,N,E,R, and the vowel sound of the "er"
- "prem" has the consonants P,R,E,M, and the vowel sound of the "em".

Both have identical consonants and matching vowel and consonant sounds: B=P, R=M, E=E, R=E. Therefore, they are considered to rhyme.</s>
patina, messina, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "patina" and "Messina" rhyme because both end with the same vowel and consonant sound, which is "na".</s>
facilitation, annexation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they share the same sounding consonant in the syllable before the vowel; both words have 'facilitation' and 'annexation,' which have consonant 'c.' The vowels and consonant sounds remain the same in both words, so they rhyme.</s>
priscilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "priscilla" and "costilla" do rhyme since the rhyme scheme is a "a" rhyme, where the final vowel sound is identical (/a/ in both words). The other consonant sounds can vary, but the final "a" sound is the same.</s>
sidey, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 
 
The words "sidey-kain" do not rhyme with each other as they do not have identical consonant sounds or follow the same pattern of consonant and vowel sounds. The word "sidey" is a noun that means a small piece of side meat, while the word "kain" is a verb that means to put or place something. The combination of these two words, specifically the arrangement of the consonants, does not create a pattern that would make them sound similar or rhyme.</s>
clarence, terence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "clarence" and "terence" have the same vowel sound (ee) and the same consonant sounds at the end (z and r). They rhyme.</s>
kenney, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kenney" and "jamb" are considered to rhyme because they end with the same vowel sound (ee) followed by consonant sounds (/ɛn/) and (/æ/) that are different but followed by the same ending sound.</s>
protestation, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "protestation" and "synchronization" rhyme because both end with the same sequence of sounds, which is /sjuəˈfɒrənsjuːʃən/. The presence of the identical vowel sound (u) followed by the same consonant sound (s, for example) at the ends of both words demonstrates that they indeed rhyme.</s>
prom, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. "Prom-jamb" has different consonants in each word and does not end with the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
bleary, mcgeary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
calculation, communization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. They share a common pattern of identical sounds in the final consonants and vowels ("ion" at the end of "calculation" and "ization" at the end of "communization").</s>
kissling, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. "Kissling" and "Oslo" do not have the same consonant and vowel sounds in their endings. The final consonants "g" and "g" are different as are the final vowels "l" and "o".</s>
kisling, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kisling" and "rosene" rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds. "Kisling" and "rosene" are both examples of homophones, which are words that sound the same but have different meanings and may or may not rhyme with other words.</s>
hannam, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "hannam" and "koehne" rhyme. Both words have the same consonants and vowels (h, a, n, a, m and k, o, e, h, e, n). However, the words don't rhyme perfectly since they are spelled differently, the last letter of the first word (m) is pronounced as a "m" sound whereas the last letter of the second word (n) is pronounced as an "en" sound, which gives them an imperfect ending sound in their rhyming. But still, these two words have the same pattern for both the consonants and vowels, making them rhyming words.</s>
gummi, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gummi" and "irison" do rhyme as they have the same vowel sound (ee) followed by the same consonant sound at the end (ee).</s>
swilling, instilling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "swilling-instilling" rhyme because they both end with the same consonant sounds (L), and the vowel and consonant sounds before that are the same (I and I).</s>
stagflation, excitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "stagflation" and "excitation" have the ending consonant sound (/tʃ/ and /s/ respectively), which are identical and follow identical vowel sounds (/e/ in both words). Thus, they rhyme.</s>
scary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scary-mcnary" do rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (y = n). The "y" that appears after the "n" in both words causes the "i" before and after the "n" to sound the same, resulting in the final syllables rhyming.</s>
iacona, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "iacona" and "braner" rhyme because they both end with identical vowel and consonant sounds (i.e. "on" and "ran").</s>
sheilah, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'sheilah' and 'oconnor' rhyme as they both have the same vowel sound (the schwa sound) after a different consonant: 'h' in 'sheilah' and 'n' in 'oconnor'. These words do share the same consonant and vowel sounds, therefore they rhyme.</s>
unofficial, judicial, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "unofficial" and "judicial" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
swilling, billing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "swilling" and "billing" rhyme as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
sidey, shiller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sidey" and "shiller" do rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (AE) followed by identical consonant sounds (sidey vs. shiller). However, they differ in the consonant sounds at the beginning of the words, which do not affect their rhyme.</s>
meeler, biehler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'meeler' and 'biehler' rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds, despite having different consonants in the beginning of the words.</s>
bearer, starer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. The words bearer-starer both end in the sound of the letter 'ar', which can be considered a rhyme. The only difference between them is the initial part of the word (bearer vs. starer), which doesn't change the rhyme.</s>
cannes, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cannes" and "arison" rhyme. They both have the same vowel sound "a" followed by consonant sounds "n" and "s" in "cannes" and "r" and "s" in "arison."</s>
litigating, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds after the same vowel sound. The first word, "litigating", has the consonant sounds "it" and "at", while the second word, "prom", has the consonant sounds "pr" and "m". Additionally, the vowel sound in "lit" of the first word is different from the vowel sound in "pr" of the second word. Therefore, the words do not share the same rhyme structure or consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
akana, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "akana" and "bran" rhyme because they have identical vowel sounds (both ending with the vowel "a") and only differ by a single consonant sound (the c in "a-kana" vs. the k in "bran").</s>
synchronization, approbation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "synchronization" and "approbation" rhyme because they share the same ending pattern of a consonant sound followed by the same vowel sound and consonant sound. The first consonant in both words is different, but the rest of the vowels and consonants are identical. This creates a recognizable rhyme.</s>
gotten, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they both have the same vowel sound (t in both gotten and brun) followed by identical consonant sounds at the end. In this case, the only difference is the consonants (gotten has 't' at the end and brun has 'n').</s>
rumination, agglomeration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "rumination" and "agglomeration" rhyme because both words have the same consonant sounds, just in a different order. They share the same vowel sound (/aɪ/ in both words) and only differ in the consonants that come before it.</s>
caryl, deryle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'caryl' and 'deryle' do rhyme in the sense that they share identical vowel and consonant sounds. They both start with the same vowel sound ("ca-ryl") but differ in the consonant sound following it.</s>
reevaluation, mutation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words you provided, "reevaluation" and "mutation," do indeed rhyme. They both have the same vowel sounds but differ in the consonant sounds at the end of each word. This pattern of identical vowel sounds followed by consonant sounds results in a rhyme between the two words.</s>
resignations, diversifications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "resignations" and "diversifications" rhyme because they share the same consonant and vowel sounds as seen in the repetition of "ions" in the two words. The difference in vowels ('r' in "resignation" and 'i' in "diversification") does not make the consonant sounds different, hence, these words are considered to rhyme.</s>
replication, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "replication-nitration" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end, or they can be spoken "ration" is an informal or colloquial spelling.</s>
weary, cleary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "weary" and "cleary" do rhyme because they share the same vowel sound "ai" and have consonant sounds that are followed by the same consonant "er" at the end.</s>
mary, frary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mary" and "frary" do rhyme, as they both share the same final consonant sound (/RI:/).</s>
resented, lamented, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words, "resented" and "lamented," are anapests that rhyme. 

In poetry, anapests follow a rule of four syllable feet where the first syllable is stressed, the second is unstressed, and the third is also stressed. This pattern creates the appearance of a syllable with unstressed notes, giving it the name "unstressed foot" - anapests. 

In "resented" and "lamented," they both follow this specific rhyme scheme because of the unstressed-stress pattern - unstressed-stressed, stressed-unstressed. 

In linguistic terms, the words may not technically rhyme when considering more classical rules of rhyming such as complete rhymes, (like "brother" and "mother") but using anapests, they do rhyme. This approach assumes syllables have a value in relation to their stress, which results in a rhyme pattern rather than strict pronunciation based on vowel or consonant sounds. In the case of "resented" and "lamented," their anapestic rhyme makes them seem similar, even though they technically don't follow the conventional rules of the words' rhyme.</s>
coiner, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, I will generate a Yes/No answer and justify my conclusion.

Answer: Yes

Justification: The words "coiner-premo" have the same vowel sound: "oo" in "coine-preme." The consonant sounds are also the same. In other words, they are homophones and may be considered rhyming words.</s>

acid, scholl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
hermon, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words 'hermon' and 'kain' do not rhyme. They differ in the presence of a consonant, 'r' in 'hermon', which prevents the identical vowel and consonant sounds from being present in 'kain'.</s>
decapitations, innovations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "decapitations-innovations" rhyme because they share the consonant pattern "CVCVC" (with "C" representing any consonant sound), followed by identical vowel (open "a") and final consonant "ion".</s>
bowron, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bowron" and "locatelli" rhyme as they both share the consonant sounds "/b r ə n/" and "/l ə t ə l i/", followed by the identical vowel sound of /i/ in both cases.</s>

recalculation, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "recalculation" and "graduation" have the same consonant sounds, but they are spelled differently. The letters "c" and "g" in these words produce the same consonant sound, and the vowels "a" and "u" are identical in both words. Although the spelling is different, this pattern of repeating consonant and vowel sounds is known as a palindromic rhyme.</s>
schuler, haman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No</s>
postdating, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "postdating" and "herronimo" do rhyme, as they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds even though the consonants are different in each word. The rhyme is "e" in "postdating" and "er" in "herronimo." Rhyming words can still create a sense of familiarity, which plays a role in words that evoke emotional feelings or associations, despite having subtle differences in their pronunciation.</s>
adelanto, delsanto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because of the consonants (the "T" sound and "N" sound) that follow identical vowel sounds ("o" in "adelanto" and "santo" in "delsanto"). They share the same consonant sounds, and therefore rhyme according to the rules of English phonetics.</s>
oslo, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "oslo" and "bruner" do rhyme. According to the rhyming rules, they have different consonants (sounds at the beginning of the words) followed by identical vowel ("o") and consonant ("r") sounds.</s>

The words' consonants ('-z-, -r-) are different, but they both share the same vowel sound ('-u-) followed by the same consonant sound ('-s-).</s>
schul, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schul-borneo" rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sound sequence despite having different consonant sounds before the vowel "o". Specifically, there is a "sh" sound at the beginning, followed by the identical vowel sound /o/ in both words.</s>
phosphorescence, obsolescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they share the identical sounds at the end of each word. 

The term 'rhyme' refers to words that have certain consonant patterns, followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end. In this case, both the words, 'phosphorescence' and 'obsolescence' have the exact same consonant pattern ('pho') followed by identical vowels ('oe') and consonants ('scence'). Hence, they rhyme.</s>
scary, mcgary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scary-mcgary" rhyme.

In the given word pair, the two syllables "scary" and "mcgary" form an instance of a rhyme scheme. The syllable "scary" has the consonant sounds "-s-," "-c-," "-a-," and "-r-," while "mcgary" has the syllable "mc-," which is the only difference between the two words. Despite the presence of the "-c-" sound in both words, it does not affect the rhyme, as the two words share the identical vowel sounds (-a- and -y-) and consonant sounds (-r-).</s>
cahn, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cahn" and "rosene" rhyme. They both have the same consonant sound (CCVCCV) followed by the same vowel sound (AE) at the end.</s>

Although the difference in the consonant sounds is slight – "un" vs. "g" – the basic pattern of vowels and syllables remain the same. These words can therefore be said to rhyme with the conventional understanding of the concept.</s>

indignation, ornamentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

Justification: 
"Indignation" and "ornamentation" have different consonants in the first part of the words, which means they do not follow the required pattern of rhyming. In the word "indignation", the first consonants are "in-" while in "ornamentation", the first consonants are "or-". Thus, the words don't rhyme.</s>
elko, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "elko-jam" do rhyme. They have a similar ending sound ("-o-" and "-m" in each word), which is the defining feature of a slant rhyme.</s>
sudd, schul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sudd-schul" rhyme because the identical vowel sound 'u' and consonant sound 'l' are shared after different consonant sounds (s and d) in each word.</s>
sheley, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sheley-incase" rhyme because both words share the same consonant sound pattern followed by an identical vowel. The only difference is the insertion of the hyphen, resulting in different syllables and a different pronunciation.</s>
petrilli, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "petrilli" and "noxso" do rhyme because they share the same consonant and vowel sound pattern (p-e-t-r-i-l-l, and n-o-x-s-o). Despite the difference in the final consonant "l" and "x" respectively, the sound of the words still rhyme due to the matching consonant and vowel combinations.</s>
geitner, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geitner" and "zeal" do rhyme as they have the same consonant and vowel sounds at the end. A rhyme is said to be stressed or unstressed based on whether the last syllable matches exactly (lexical rhyme) or has a slight difference (onomatopoeic rhyme).

shelley, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

In the words "shelley" and "jam", despite having the letter "y" in common, the consonant sounds in the end of these words are vastly different. "shelley" sounds more like "ship" and "jam" resembles "ham", while the words are indeed spelled with the same vowel sounds, they do not produce similar consonant sounds, making them not a rhyming pair.</s>
excelling, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "excelling" and "jimmy" rhyme with each other because they both have the same vowel sound at the end (ee), and the consonant at the beginning of each word also sounds the same (both start with the letter x).</s>

saad, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saad" and "cannery" do indeed rhyme, as they share the same vowel sound (/eɪ/) followed by the same consonant sound (/n/).</s>
shaul, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'shaul' and 'oconnor' do rhyme because they share an identical vowel and consonant sound pattern consisting of different consonants. In this case, 'shaul' starts with 's' and 'o' while 'oconnor' starts with 'o', both are followed by the 'n' and 'r' sound, resulting in a syllabic and phonetic consonantal rhyme for the words.</s>
teary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "teary-geary" rhyme because the consonant sounds at the end of each word (r and ea, respectively) are both identical and followed by the same vowel sound (i in both cases). This makes the words partially rhymed, as they share the same vowel sound in the end. However, since the consonant sounds are distinct, it could be considered a partial rhyme rather than a full rhyme.</s>
tsuda, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
sudd, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sudd-arison" rhyme. The key points to identify rhyme are that it involves sounds made by the same set of consonants at the end of a word, followed by two identical vowel sounds (for an "A"/"a" sound, and for an "E"/"e" sound).

For "sudd-arison", the two vowels are: 

A: The first "u" sounds like "uu" followed by the "h" sound, making the ending vowel sound "oo".
E: The "d" at the end of the word sounds like the letter "d," making the ending vowel sound "ee".

So, the key consonants and vowel sounds that should be present for a rhyme is indeed present in "sudd-arison".</s>
ken, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ken-jamb" rhyme, as they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (k and m in the beginning, followed by the same vowel, and the same consonant in the end).</s>
barn, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "barn-jemmie" rhyme since they share the same syllable structure and the same consonant sounds. The only difference is the consonant sounds at the end of each word, but they follow the same vowel sound pattern and are still considered part of the same rhyme.</s>
non-residential, preferential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "non-residential" and "preferential" rhyme, as they share the same consonant sounds ("non-res" and "pre") followed by the same vowel sound ("e").</s>
koon, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "koon-boerner" rhyme because both words have a repeating sound at the end ("ern" in the second word). Although the words have different syllable structures, they still share the same vowel and consonant sound at the end, resulting in a rhyming relationship.</s>
zelia, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. The consonant sounds in both words (ze, lia, reis, nauer) are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
teary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme.

The first word, "teary," has the vowel sound "ay" and the consonant sounds "t," "r," "ah," and "i." The second word, "keary," has the vowel sound "ai" and the consonant sounds "k," "ah," "r," and "y." The only similar sound between the words is the "ay" vowel at the beginning, but the other consonant and vowel sounds are different. Therefore, these words do not rhyme.</s>
prem, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "prem-jimmie" rhyme. This can be analyzed by breaking down the words into syllables and examining the identical sounding vowel and consonant sequences (not including any final vowels). The syllable pattern for "prem" and "jimmie" is /priːm/ and /dʒɪmmiː/ respectively, which both end with the vowel sound of "i". This vowel sound is the same in both words and makes them fall within the same category of rhyme.</s>
ashley, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words don't rhyme. "Ashley" and "enix" are two distinct words with no direct consonant-vowel-consonant sound pattern in common. However, they share a similar beginning with "a", but that's just an unrelated coincidence. Thus, while they don't rhyme, they do share a simple association.</s>
schul, lacaze, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schul-lacaze" rhyme in that both words have a similar sounding pattern. The -schul and -lacaze parts of the words have similar consonant sounds (both starting with "sh" and "l"). The vowel sounds (e and a) are also similar for both words. So, although the initial parts of the word do not align completely, the final parts do create a rhyme between the two words.</s>
orson, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words “Orson-bran” do rhyme. They both exhibit the same rhyme pattern "r-n," with the consonants "rs" and "rn" that sound alike justifying the rhyme.</s>

acid, aachener, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "acid" and "Aachen" do rhyme as they follow the pattern of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the difference is the consonant 'c' in "acid" and the consonant 'n' in "Aachen" but the vowels and the sound they produce remain the same. Both words end with the sound of 'ien' in different consonant groups.</s>
schlee, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schlee-noxso" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds, both beginning with "s" and ending with "x," followed by identical vowel sounds: "ee" and "oo."</s>
estimation, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These words do not rhyme, as they have different consonant sounds in the first syllables: "estimation" and "synchronization." Although the final consonant and vowel remain the same in both words (i.e., 'ation' and 'tion'), the consonant sounds they make are different.</s>
gaetano, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because the vowels and consonant sounds are identical in both words. Gaetano and Ireson both have the same vowel pattern of /eɪ/ and /tʌn/, but with different consonant sounds at the beginning (ga- and -ir-).</s>
thiery, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in their root parts. The differences are "ER" in "thiery" and "RY" in "dreary," which change the pronunciation and rhyme of the two words.</s>
sterilizations, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sterilizations" and "health" rhyme because they have different consonant sounds followed by the identical vowel sound "a" and the consonant sound "l."</s>
substantiation, antidiscrimination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'substantiation' and 'antidiscrimination' somewhat rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds at the end (/ɛnɪdɪˈskɾɪmənʃn̩/). However, the repetition of different consonant sounds before the identical vowel and consonant sounds may make the rhyme less strong.</s>
anticipations, collaborations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "anticipations" and "collaborations" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound (i.e., "ations" and "ations") following different consonant sounds (i.e., "anticipations" and "collaborations"). Rhyming words have consonant sounds in the beginning or the end of the words that are identical while the vowel sounds are slightly different, and the pattern is followed consistently.</s>
saudi, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saudi-litigating" rhyme because they have a single vowel sound in the end, which makes it sound like the words match in pronunciation. They have different consonants but the identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end make them rhyme.</s>
litwiller, siller, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "litwiller" and "siller" do rhyme, as the word "siller" contains two identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the word.</s>
tsuda, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tsuda-noxso" do rhyme because they share similar consonant sounds – "t" and "s" followed by the same vowel sound ("a"). However, the consonants before the common vowel are different, so the rhyme is slight rather than perfect.</s>
glances, refinances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "glances" and "refinances" do rhyme because they have the same ending sound (a "fin-" and a "ance" sound) with the exception of the initial consonant "g" in "glances." The "-ance" and "-ance" portion of the words both have the same vowel and consonant sounds, thus counting as a valid rhyme in English.</s>
reputation, constipation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both words "reputation" and "constipation" rhyme since they have the same consonant sound (tt) followed by different vowel sounds (eh for "reputation" and ih for "constipation"). The same consonant sound and initial vowel change make it a rhyme.</s>
bleary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bleary-keary" rhyme. 

The justification for this is that when we analyze the syllables in each word, we find the following:

- In "bleary," the syllable "ble-ar-y" consists of a vowel sound followed by two consonant sounds (b-l-r).
- In "keary," the syllable "ke-ar-y" contains a vowel sound followed by two consonant sounds (k-e-r).

Since the last two letter groups in each word (b-l-r and k-e-r) sound identical, and they are different in consonants, they rhyme.</s>
peary, seery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "peary" and "seery" rhyme because they have the same consonant sound (pronounced "pri"), and the consonant sound is followed by the same vowel sound (pronounced "ai" or "ea" depending on if you take the final "r" in "peary" or not), making them an example of homophonic rhyme.</s>
pucciarelli, cardarelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pucciarelli" and "cardarelli" do rhyme, as they both share the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds, even though they have different consonant sounds at the beginning (p in "pucciarelli" and c in "cardarelli").</s>
non-residential, reverential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme. The consonant sounds are different (n vs. r, and r vs. l), but the vowel sound remains the same (a in both words). The repeated vowel sound (a) contributes to the rhyme between both words.</s>
alco, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "alco-smullen" rhyme. Both words have identical consonant sounds ("alco-smullen" is pronounced as "alco-smullen") and the slight variation in the first syllable ("alco-") is common in words and phrases that rhyme. These words share a vowel pattern and the same last consonant sound of "en."</s>
sidi, hehman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No
These words do not rhyme because they do not have the identical vowel or consonant sounds in the final part of the words. The consonant sounds do not match in the words "sidi" and "hehman."</s>

soady, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
combinations, iterations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "combinations-iterations" have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the final sequence, making them a couple of word-rhymes. They both end in the same pattern: /zəməbaʃjənzi-daitərəʃənzɪ/.</s>
preoccupation, calculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words preoccupation and calculation do rhyme because they share the same vowel sound (ai) at the end of the word. However, they rhyme on separate syllables:

- In the word 'preoccupation,' the 'o' in 'occupation' is the primary source of the rhyme with 'calculation.'
- In the word 'calculation,' the 'a/e' sound in 'calculate' is the primary source of the rhyme.</s>
nary, gery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. "Nary-gery" has a rhyme scheme of Ae (assonance) in the pattern of /nərɪj/.</s>
circumventing, tenting, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "circumventing" and "tenting" rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the different consonant sounds at the ends of each word, but these two consonant sounds still create the same vowel sound before it and do not change the overall pattern of the words.</s>
mcgary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mcgary" and "mccrary" rhyme because they have the same consonant sounds (m-c) but use different consonants before the identical vowel sound (gh and cr).</s>
citation, authentication, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No
The words "citation-authentication" do not rhyme because their spelling and sound patterns do not follow the typical pattern of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
mary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
camilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "camilla" and "costilla" do rhyme. They have different consonants (c and s) but follow the same pattern of identical vowel (a and i) and consonant sounds (l and ll) that create the rhyme.</s>
swilling, schilling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "swilling" and "schilling" rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant pattern but with a different consonant sound. In this case, the difference is the '-ll-' sound in 'swilling' and the '-ll-' or '-lin-' sound in 'schilling'.</s>
suppressant, bessent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "suppressant-bessent" rhyme because they have the same consonant sound repeated at the end ("suppress-ant" and "bessent").</s>
weary, o'leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "weary" and "O'leary" rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds following different consonants.</s>
stiller's, drillers, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. Let's break it down:

1. The first word, "stiller's-drillers," has two distinct parts: "stiller's" and "-drillers."
2. Looking at the parts of the word, "stiller's" does not rhyme with the entire word. There are two different syllables for each part: "stil-ler's," and "stil-ler-s."
3. Regarding the identical vowel and consonant sounds, the main difference between these words is the vowel sound in "stiller's" and the hyphen and consonant in "-drillers." The sounds for the letters "s" and "r" and the vowel "e" in "stiller's" are quite similar to the vowel and consonant sounds in "-drillers." 

However, the overall sounds between the two words are not similar enough to be considered a genuine "rhyme." Additionally, there is a discrepancy in the spelling and capitalization since one word starts with an uppercase "S" and doesn't have an apostrophe in the second half, while the other lacks the capitalization and has an apostrophe in the second half. These structural differences are not typically considered when evaluating the "rhyme" between words.</s>
elko, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "elko" and "castings" rhyme. This is because they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds, despite having different initial consonants.</s>
schaal, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schaal" and "hannam" do rhyme as they have the same consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, which matches the definition you provided.</s>
schiller, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schiller" and "gemma" rhyme. They are both compound words, where the first part, "schil," is a different vowel and consonant sound from the second part, "em," found in the second word. So, despite the different vowel and consonant sounds, there is still a rhyming pattern because they share the identical consonant sound.</s>
magnification, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme.</s>
devaluations, inaugurations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "devaluations" and "inaugurations" rhyme because they share the same consonant patterns in their spelling but have different vowels. The vowel sounds in both words, "devaluations" (ɪdɪˈvjʊə.ɛʃənz) and "inaugurations" (ˈɪnəɡjʊrə.eɪʃənz), are different but still maintain the same consonant sounds. These sounds are "di" ("devaluations"), "i" ("inaugurations"), and "ə" (the schwa sound in both words). In other words, the final syllables "ation" have the same vowel sounds, but they come after distinct words.</s>
resilience, brilliance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "resilience" and "brilliance" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (i.e., the "r" sound in "s" at the end of "resilience" and the "r" sound in "s" at the end of "brilliance"). The only consonant difference is the "r" in the first word, which is followed by the same vowel and consonant sound in the second word.</s>
seder, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seder-barrineau" do rhyme. Both words end with the same pattern of consonant sounds, which is "-in-e". This is known as a consonant rhyme.</s>
hearty, moriarty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hearty" and "moriarty" do rhyme, as they share the same pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words. The consonants are different, but they are followed by the same consonant sound, making the rhyme.</s>
kanner, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, the words "kanner-bryna" do not rhyme. They contain different consonant sounds following an identical vowel sound ("k" and "b" in "kanner" and "k" in "bryna"). While they may contain similar vowel sounds ("i" in both), the consonant sounds are distinct and not part of a typical rhyme scheme.</s>
look, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "look-jimmy" are an example of a rhyming pair. Though the endings of "look" and "jimmy" are pronounced differently, they share the same vowel and consonant sounds (look), which rhyme. This is due to the presence of a common -ly ending in both words.</s>
francesmary, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "francesmary" and "mccary" do rhyme. They share a pattern of vowel and consonant sounds that matches the rhyming structure of a regular rhyme.</s>
refinances, enhances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "refinances" and "enhances" rhyme. Both words have the same consonant sounds (rfnsn and nhns) but with different endings (es for the first word and s for the second word).

admiration, experimentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme.</s>
rosten, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme.

Rhyme is a property of words that have the same vowel sounds and end with a consonant sound that differs by only one consonant. The words "rosten" and "brun" do not fit this definition, as the vowel sounds are different and the consonant sounds are similar but not identical. Therefore, these words do not rhyme.</s>
seider, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seider-litigating" rhyme because they share the same sound between the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern i.e. se-it-gi-a-tion. The consonants 'se', 'it', 'gi', 'a' and 't' have the same vowel sound ('i') and consonant sound ('tion').</s>
replication, affirmation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No

These words "replication-affirmation" do not rhyme since the vowels in each word (e and o respectively) are different. Although the structure of the words is similar, they create different and distinct sounds when spoken or sung, which means they do not rhyme.</s>
annex, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "annex-coiner" rhyme as they have the same final consonant sound (/r/) and the identical vowel sound (/ɪ/) before it. The only difference in the consonant sounds is "-nx" and "-kr", but they are both pronounced as /n/ and /k/, respectively, when said together.</s>
nyx, zaley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nyx-zaley" have the same consonant sounds, specifically /njks/ and /zl/ at the ends of each word. The only difference is a change in the final consonant of "nyx," which changes to /l/ in "zaley." This change does not affect the rhyme between the words as both end sounds are still /l/.</s>

necaise, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "necaise" and "jaimie" do rhyme since they both have a common vowel sound (i) and consonant sound at the end (C/S). Additionally, the consonant sound in "necaise" (N) and "jaimie" (J) create an unconventional but still recognizable rhyme.</s>
interference, reappearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "interference-reappearance" rhyme with each other since they have the same vowel and consonant sounds, even though the consonants are different. In this case, the identical vowel sound is "e" and the consonant sounds are "n."</s>
saad, heyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saad-heyman" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds in the second syllable, even though the consonants are different. (The vowels are "a" in both words, and the consonants are "s" and "m" respectively.) The presence of the same vowel sound followed by a consonant that is different creates a rhyme. It is important to note that a proper rhyme requires the words to have the exact same vowel sound in the second syllable, even if the consonant sounds are somewhat similar (or even different) due to changing rules and variations in accents.</s>
ratification, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. "Ratification" and "meditation" both end with the consonant and vowel sequence "e-a-t." This particular rhyme scheme is classified as "syllabic" rhyme, as the rhyme is caused by the identical syllables in both words.</s>
clarence, forbearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "clarence" and "forbearance" do rhyme. They have different consonants (C vs C) followed by identical final consonant sounds (/rəns/ and /rɛnjs/) and the same vowel sound (/la/ or /ɔl/).</s>
darjeeling, wheeling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

The two words "darjeeling" and "wheeling" do rhyme because the final syllables "jeeling" and "ling" produce identical vowel and consonant sounds – "ee" and "ng" respectively.</s>
ablation, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. 

The words "ablation-synchronization" share the same ending sounds ([aɪ]n'səˌnaɪərəˈkeɪʃən]): 
- "ablation" ends with the [aɪ] sound.
- "synchronization" also ends with the [aɪ] sound.

This pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds after a different initial consonant or vowel is known as a consonant+vowel+consonant+vowel+consonant (CVCVC) rhyme.</s>
notification, amalgamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme as they have consonants that are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the final consonant of both words, "t" and "m", sound the same when pronounced.</s>
schuele, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuele" and "zel" rhyme because they share the same consonant and vowel patterns. Both words have an "e" sound at the end and the pattern "sch-" followed by a "z." Rhyming is defined when words with different consonant sounds have the same vowel and consonant patterns.</s>
killion, trillion, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "killion" and "trillion" rhyme. Although they rhyme in this case, it's important to note that a more accurate measure of whether words sound similar to each other is called "blending," and if the entire sequence of letters can be pronounced in a similar way regardless of specific vowels. In that case, the word "trillion" and the compound word "killion" do not actually blend.</s>
essential, differential, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because they have different consonants ('essential' starts with 's', 'differential' starts with 'd').</s>

talty, faulty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "talty" and "faulty" rhyme because they both end with the same consonant and vowel combinations ("t-a-l-t" and "f-a-u-t-y"). However, the second word also has a different consonant sound at the beginning, which could make the initial perception of rhyme different.</s>
alamillo, casillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "alamillo" and "casillo" rhyme because they both have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. This is known as onset and rhyme in phonetics. The consonants are 'm' in "alamillo" and 's' in "casillo," and both words end with the same vowel and consonant sequence, "ll-o-," which contributes to the rhyme.</s>
ilk, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ilk-gemma" rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds following different consonants: in the first word, we have "ilk" followed by the identical sound "emma."

shill, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shill" and "arseneau" do rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds at the end, followed by the same vowel sound. The difference in letters (sh-ll vs. aa-sna) at the beginning does not change the overall rhyme sound, which is the main focus when determining if two words rhyme.</s>
predation, reiteration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "predation" and "reiteration" rhyme as they have the same consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
homann, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "homann-reasner" rhyme as they share the same vowel sound and consonant pattern. However, it is important to note that the hyphen in the middle of the word can change the sound, as in the case of "rea-sner."</s>

However, they do not rhyme perfectly because "zelia" ends with "e" and "sumerlin" ends with "n" - different vowel sounds at the end. So, the words should be considered as partially rhyming, but not perfectly.</s>

- "Guyton" is pronounced "goo-it-on," with the first consonant sounding like the "g" in "goose."
- "Enix" is pronounced "en-iss," with the first consonant sounding like the "n" in "bank."

The key to the rhyme lies in the repeated final consonant, which makes the words sound similar: "on" in each word has the same vowel sound (in the spelling, it's the long A sound, like in "honor").

The only thing they share is the repetition of the letter "a" as the final consonant, but that is not a sufficient reason to classify them as rhyming words.</s>
scary, gery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scary-gery" rhyme because they follow the same pattern of consonant sounds followed by the same vowel 'ai' consonant combination.</s>
witching, snitching, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "witching" and "snitching" do rhyme, as they have a similar consonant and vowel pattern:

- They both begin with the consonant "w."
- The second and third syllables both end with the consonant "c."
- The vowel sound between the consonants is consistent.

Here's the breakdown of the repeating elements:

1. Consonant sounds before the vowel: "w, w"
2. Final consonant sounds: "c, c"
3. Vowel sounds between the consonants: "i, i"

By meeting these criteria, "witching" and "snitching" rhyme with each other.</s>
mccreary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mccreary" and "beary" do rhyme. They share the same pattern of vowel and consonant sounds, specifically the ending sound of "ay" (long vowel).</s>
cedar, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cedar" and "brun" rhyme. They share the same pattern of ending consonants (in this case, both have a "n" sound ending), and the only difference in the vowel sound is a minor variation (the "c" and the "r" don't exactly match in their pronunciation, but they're close enough that it counts as rhyming).</s>
schueler, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schueler-easily" rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds (SCHUELER) and vowel sound (EY).</s>
cane, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cane" and "jimi" rhyme because they have the same pattern of consonant and vowel sounds at the end.</s>
lary, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lary" and "fery" are considered to rhyme because they have the same vowel sound 'i' followed by the same consonant sound 'y'. However, there is an exception here because 'lary' is the term for the vocal cords, whereas 'fery' appears to be a misspelling or unrelated word. To avoid confusion, the correct term should likely be spelled and pronounced as "lyry" to maintain a consistent rhyme.</s>
gama, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the word "gama-barrineau" rhymes. This is because, despite having different consonants and different consonant sounds at the beginning, the "e" sound at the end of both words creates a rhyme pattern.</s>
scholer, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. The words "scholer" and "nix" have the same vowel sound (sch-ol-er) and the same consonant sound in the word "x" at the end. So they rhyme, as they have the same ending consonant and vowel sound pattern.</s>
risner, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme.

The words "risner-primo" do not rhyme because the consonant and vowel sounds are different for the two words, as "risner-primo" contains distinct consonant sounds and vowel sounds between the two words.</s>
freely, sheely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "freely" and "sheely" rhyme because they have different consonants that then follow the same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the consonants are "f" and "s" in "freely" and "e" and "y" in "sheely."</s>

russification, pronunciation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "russification" and "pronunciation" do rhyme because they share the same vowel sounds at the end of each word: 

- "ussification" ends with the vowel sounds "us"
- "onunciation" ends with the vowel sounds "on"

Both endings have the same consonant and vowel sounds, resulting in a rhyme.</s>
herminie, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sound pattern but with different consonants at the end.</s>
cannes, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cannes" and "gemme" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sequences with only one consonant (S and M) differing between them.</s>
baranowski, osowski, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
pucciarelli, poparelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "pucciarelli" and "poparelli" rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end, even though the consonants before the vowel are different ("pp" vs "pb"). 

In this case, both words have the same rhyme scheme "ucc-a-a-r-l-l-i-" which is typical for Italian and other Romance language name endings. They differ in the first consonant ("p" in "pucciarelli" to "p" in "poparelli"), but this difference is not sufficient to disqualify their rhyme.</s>
laurence, abhorrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. Both "laurence" and "abhorrence" have the consonant sounds "l-r-n-s" followed by the identical vowel sound "e" at the end.</s>
facilitation, fluoridation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. The words "facilitation" and "fluoridation" both have the letter "a" as their final consonant, and the other letters in their respective parts of the words also create similar sounds, making them a rhyming pair.</s>
mijares, tabares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mijares" and "tabares" rhyme because they have identical vowel sounds ('i' at the end of both words), and only differ by the consonant sounds at the beginning of the words.</s>

oleary, deary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words "oleary" and "deary" rhyme because they both have the same vowel and consonant sound at the end. The difference in the consonant sounds in the beginning of the words is what makes them distinct from each other, but in terms of the rhyming aspect, the sounds in the ending match for both words.</s>
alcoa's, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "alcoa's" and "braner" rhyme because they have a common ending consonant '-ea' sound, despite the difference in the initial vowel sound 'a' versus 'b'. This type of rhyme is known as "consonant cluster" rhyme.</s>
lyke, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lyke" and "jamb" do rhyme as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the consonants "ly" and "j" form the rhyme between the two words.</s>

Although they have different consonants before the vowel sound, their overall vowel and consonant sounds match in both words, which makes them rhyme.</s>
postdating, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "postdating" and "bran" rhyme. This is because both words share the same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the consonant sounds "st" in "postdating" and "c" in "bran" match, while the vowel sounds match as well, resulting in a "near rhyme."</s>
saad, shelor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saad" and "shelor" rhyme because they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (the "a" and "o" in "shelor" are pronounced similarly to the "e" and "d" in "saad").</s>
armadillo, delillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "armadillo" and "delillo" rhyme because they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds after the initial consonant(s). In this case, the final vowel sounds of both words are "il", and their penultimate consonant sounds are both "arm", "del", "illo", and "dillo".</s>
calculation, agglomeration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because although the words have different consonants (C/k and G/g), they share identical vowel-consonant sounds. Vowels (e/E at the end of each) remain the same, and only the consonant sounds at the beginning vary. Therefore, these words rhyme in a simple pattern of vowel/sounding patterns, meeting the rhyming criteria.</s>
zel, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zel-brony" rhyme because they have identical consonant sounds at the end (l and n) and the same vowel sound (e).</s>
saad, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saad" and "healthy" rhyme because they both share the same consonant sound ("th" in "healthy") followed by an identical vowel sound ("a" in both words). Rhyming words typically follow this pattern, as it helps create a sense of musicality and familiarity in language.</s>
differential, providential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "differential" and "providential" do rhyme. They both have the same consonant sounds at the end, just in different order, and share the same vowel sound. This is known as onset-rime rhyme, where the final consonants are identical in both words.</s>
kary, wary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme as they both have the same vowel sound (a) at the end of the word and they differ only in the consonants in between (k vs. c), thus having the same consonant and vowel sound.</s>
diaper, piper, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "diaper" and "piper" rhyme because they share the sound of the same final consonant and vowel - "er" and "i" respectively. In rhyming, identical vowels and consonant sounds are important for creating a sense of harmony and match in a poem or song.</s>
lacaze, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lacaze" and "enex" rhyme because they have the same consonant sound (C in all three words), and they all end with the same vowel sound (E).</s>
mcqueary, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mcqueary" and "thiery" do rhyme because they share the same repeating sound sequence of "k-w-r-y". This pattern of identical vowel and consonant sounds is a common feature of rhyme in many languages, including English.</s>
barn, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds in the end, with only one consonant being different (n and m in "barn" and "jimi"). This pattern is known as "near rhyme" or "slight rhyme."</s>
replication, stagflation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both of the given words, "replication" and "stagflation," do rhyme. They have different consonant sounds at the beginning, but the identical 'A' sound in the second syllable creates a rhyming effect.</s>
administrations, estimations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words do rhyme. 

The justification for this is based on their pronunciation. If we pronounce "administrations" as /ædˈminɪstraʃənz/ and "estimations" as /ɪstˈeɪməʃənz/ or /ɪstˈɛməʃənz/, we can see that the end part /-ations/ and /-ations/ share the same last syllable structure and pronunciation, with similar vowel and consonant sounds at the end (t, /aɪ/, -, -sh, and -nz in each case). Thus, as per the criterion for determining rhyme in English, these words rhyme as they both follow the same syllable pattern (/...ənz/) and have the same structure.</s>
zamarello, chiarello, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zamarello" and "chiarello" rhyme because the consonant sounds at the end of each word are the same (m and l, respectively) and the vowel sound changes (a and o) but in a way that creates the same syllable shape in both words.</s>
popularization, ornamentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words do rhyme because, although the spelling is different, the sound created by the consonant and vowel combination at the end is the same. In the words "popularization" and "ornamentation," the consonant and vowel patterns at the ends are /pɔpjulˈeɪʃn/ and /ɔrˈnæmənaɪʃn/, respectively. The "-ation" suffix is what gives the words their rhyme.</s>
interpretation, liberation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes
These words, "interpretation-liberation," do rhyme because they have identical vowel sounds (i.e., 'ee' at the end of each word). The consonants before each word's vowel are different but share similar consonant sounds, making them rhyme together.</s>
presenter, menter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "presenter" and "menter" do rhyme. They both share the same consonant sounds: "pr-" and "st-," followed by the identical consonant and vowel sound "en" and "er."</s>
petrelli, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "petrelli" and "barrineau" rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds. 

The words share common consonant sounds in the beginning ("p-t-r-l-l-i") and close with the same vowel sound ("i" in both cases). This is a classic example of how spoken words can have a degree of similarity even if their origins or spelling may be different.</s>
interpretation, affirmation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "interpretation-affirmation" do rhyme as they have different consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The sounds in these words are EE, AH, FR, and AH, respectively.</s>
kisling, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kisling" and "locatelli" rhyme because they share the same vowel sounds (i.e., "is," "li") and only differ in the consonant sounds. Specifically, the consonant pairs are "ks" and "ck" in "kisling" and "ll" and "lt" in "locatelli."</s>
extermination, duration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end.</s>
consented, segmented, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "consented" and "segmented" rhyme. They have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which is a common pattern for rhyming words in English.</s>
heyman, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'heyman' and 'kenney' rhyme because they have different consonants (h vs k, and n vs n) but have identical vowel and consonant sounds in the end. The rhyme scheme is 'a-a'.</s>
ashley, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ashley" and "arseneau" rhyme because both have the same consonant and vowel sound at the end of the syllable, despite being spelled differently. The consonants are "sh" in ashley and "n" in arseneau, while the vowels are both "e."</s>
sidi, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. The sound patterns of "sidi-premo" and "pride" are the same, starting with a consonant – in this case, "s" – and ending with a vowel and a consonant ("i" and "p" in "sidi" and "premo", "e" and "d" in "pride").</s>
reaver's, leaver's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "reaver's" and "leaver's" do rhyme, as they both have "-er" endings and similar vowel sounds. In this case, the letters with different symbols (letter "r" at the end of one and letter "s" at the end of the other) don't prevent the words from rhyming since they represent identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
o'shell, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || I am not sure if you meant "o'shell-rosene" to be one word or two since the phrase seems to consist of two words – "o'shell" and "rosene". 

To determine if these words rhyme by checking for identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words, we need to consider it one word. If it is meant to be one word (o'shell-rosene), it doesn't rhyme because the end sounds (the "l" and "s" in "rosene" and "shell") aren't the same. These words have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
sawdey, patrol, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sawdey" and "patrol" do rhyme because they share the same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, they both end with the pattern "a" followed by the same consonant sound.</s>
keehan, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "keehan" and "jimi" rhyme, as they have identical vowel and consonant sounds (kee-han; Jimi).</s>
vary, stary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vary-stary" rhyme because they both share the same vowel sounds and end with the same consonant sounds. In this case, they have a "Y" added to the end for variation, but otherwise their consonant sounds are the same, making this a diphthong rhyme or near-rhyme.</s>
scholey, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scholey" and "kearn" do rhyme. This is because they have different consonant sounds at the beginning (sh and k respectively), but identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end (both end with the sound "ay"). These "identical vowel and consonant sounds" is a characteristic of "near rhymes" as per the Poetic Justice Wheel.</s>
khomeini, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "khomeini" and "summerlin" are a-rhyming words. They both have the same consonant sounds (/khom-/ and /səm-/) followed by identical vowel sounds (/aɪn/ and /aɪn/). This pattern of shared identical consonant and vowel sounds between the two words makes them rhyme.</s>
cheery, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cheery-thiery" rhyme. They share the same vowel sound (e), and both words end with the consonant sound "r". Rhyming words typically follow this pattern of having a common vowel sound as the last component and having similar consonant sounds before the vowel.</s>
hamner, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, "hamner" and "zele" rhyme because they have the identical sounds of /æmənər/ and /zɛlɛ/ respectively. Both words have the same consonants (/m-n-r/) combined with the same vowel sound (/ɛ/).</s>
meditation, devaluation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "meditation" and "devaluation" rhyme because they both have the same vowel sound ("a") and the same consonant sound on the end ("tions"). The consonants in both words are just rearranged, but they still create the same sounds.</s>
shelly, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelly-haggart" rhyme because they share the same consonant sounds (sh-ll-h-g-tr) followed by the identical vowel sound. It is a pattern called near-full rhyme or unstressed syllable rhyme.</s>
swilling, filling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. Both words, "swilling" and "filling," have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the consonants ("w" and "l" in "swilling," and "f" in "filling") that change the overall consonant sounds.</s>
sowed, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sowed" and "Nyx" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by the same vowel and consonant sound. The rhyme occurs in the final consonant sounds "d" and "x."</s>
shelley, heyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelley" and "heyman" are pronounced with the same vowel sounds and have a similar rhyme. Even though they have different consonant sounds and endings, they have the same starting vowel sound ("ee" in "shelley" and "ee" in "heyman"). This makes them a type of non-palindromic rhyming words, where the vowel sounds remain the same but the consonant sounds and endings are different.</s>
health, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "health" and "bruney" rhyme because they have the same consonant and vowel sounds in different word positions.</s>
petralia, homeowner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme as they both have identical vowel and consonant sounds following different consonants.</s>
gumm, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes</s>
russification, simulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "russification" and "simulation" are homophones, as they have the same pronunciation but different meanings. 

In the given example, "russification" is the act of adopting, assimilating, or imitating the customs, traditions, or practices of another culture or country, while "simulation" means a representation of something that is not real, but made to appear real or as if it were true; or the act or process of simulating something.

Though the words do not share the exact same rhyme, as they do not end with the same consonant, they still rhyme due to the identical pattern of vowel sounds followed by a consonant sound (S), which makes them homophones. Additionally, the pattern of similar consonant sounds adds to the overall phonetic similarity, making "russification" and "simulation" phonetically similar words even though they do not share the exact same pronunciation or meaning.</s>
saudi, scholer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saudi" and "scholar" rhyme. The justification comes from the understanding of how phonetic words can be, where sounds are identified by their combination of vowels and consonants. In this case, despite the different spelling, both words share identical and similar ends – "ee" and "r" – that create the same sound. 

In many English rhyming dictionaries, these words would be considered rhyming words due to the presence of these recurrent sounds in their ending. This phenomenon of similar sound is the basis of the concept of phonetic metre, a part of the larger field of phonology known as phonetics.</s>
zele, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zele-germe" do rhyme, as they both end with the same consonant and vowel sound pattern (e-ee-e). However, they are homophones, which means they sound identical but have different meanings. The first word, "zelenia", means a dish or plate, and it is the second person plural past participle of the verb "zeleniti" (to dazzle or enlighten). The second word, "germe" (from Germanic origin), is an adjective that means "dry, hard, tough, or stiff", and it comes from the Latin "germus" (gist). So, while they sound the same, they do not mean the same thing.</s>
deviation, rehabilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "deviation" and "rehabilitation" do rhyme since their final consonant sounds are identical (t), and the vowel sounds (i and eh) are different, but produce the same consonant sound. In this case, the "a" in "deviation" and "rehabilitation" are pronounced similarly (both ending with a vowel-like sound), thus they make a rhyme.</s>
zaley, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zaley-smullen" rhyme because they both have the same vowel and consonant sound patterns, despite the different letters (z and m are the only differences).</s>
szalay, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "szalay-brion" rhyme because they both end with the identical sound of "ay" (/eɪ/), even though the consonants are slightly different; "s" and "z" in "szalay" and "b" and "r" in "brion": 

In both words, the vowel sound /eɪ/ is the same and is paired with different consonant sounds. Thus, the two words rhyme.</s>
cod, shill, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cod-shill" rhyme because they both have a shared ending - "od-shill," which consists of identical consonant sounds followed by a vowel sound. The consonants "cod" and "shill" are both the same, but the vowel sound differs, which is the basis of rhyming words.</s>
legalization, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "legalization" and "ablation" rhyme. 

Rationale: 
Both words end with the same phonemes: -z- followed by the same vowel sound (-a), which confirms that they rhyme, despite having different consonants (l and c) that come before the identical vowel sound.</s>
fery, kary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme because they have different consonant sounds: 

- In the word "fery," the "f" sound doesn't match the "k" sound in "kary."

Rhyming words typically have the same or similar consonant sounds followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Rhyme helps with pronunciation and memory, enhancing the flow of speech and poetry. In the case of these words, the sounds do not match, and thus, they do not rhyme.</s>
cheryl, caryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, these words do not rhyme. 

"Cheryl" and "caryl" are spelled so that they sound almost the same, but there is a letter difference (the 'r' in "cheryl" is silent). This is why they are considered homophones, not rhyming words.</s>
hamner, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'hamner' and 'jimi' rhyme because they both end with the consonant sound 'im' and same vowel sound 'a.' The difference in the initial consonant 'h' and 'j' makes them different words, but the consonant sound 'im' in both words coincides with the rhyme.</s>
creation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, "creation-station" rhymes because it has different consonants (cre-a-tion and sta-tion) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (i.e. "-tion" and "-tion").</s>
shiller, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shiller" and "obryan" rhyme because they have the same vowel sound at the end (i.e., "an"), and the only difference is the consonant sound before it which is unrelated. Both words' consonant sounds before the "an" vowel sound are unrelated to each other, thus making the rhyme.</s>
ikon, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ikon" and "jamb" rhyme because they have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
sader, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sader-ozelle" rhyme, as they both share the same consonant sounds, specifically the /s-t-d-r-_-/ and /z-l-_-_-_-/ patterns, where the letters in the last positions are not specified, hence the underscores.</s>
vickery, towery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "vickery" and "towery" do rhyme because they share identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
graduation, legalization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words 'graduation' and 'legalization' rhyme. This is because both words have the same consonant sounds and just different letter combinations which are followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, specifically [a]-[k] and [u]-[s] in 'graduation' and [o]-[s] and [a]-[l] in 'legalization'. It's important to note that the words are not anagrams of each other, because their basic structure consists of words like 'education' and 'educational' which do not rhyme.</s>
spanton, stanton, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "spanton" and "stanton" rhyme because they have similar consonant and vowel sounds, specifically both words start with "sp", followed by another "p" sound. The vowel sounds are different ("a" in "spanton" and "o" in "stanton"), but the consonant and vowel patterns create a rhyming effect.</s>
destination, amalgamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "destination" and "amalgamation" rhyme, as they both have the same vowel and consonant sounds, just with different consonant letters between each.</s>
fluoridation, recalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "fluoridation" and "recalculation" rhyme because they both end with identical long vowel sounds (/aʊrədɪˈkeɪʃən/) followed by the same sounding consonant (C /tʃ/ in both words). Although the words have different initial consonant sounds (fl forfluoridation and re for recalculation), they still have the same pattern within these consonant sounds and vowel sounds. This makes them rhyme.</s>
mccleery, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mccleery-biery" rhyme because the same vowel and consonant sounds are present at the end of both words. The only difference is the placement of the consonant clusters, "Mc" and "B", but these consonant clusters are pronounced in the same way in the two words, making them rhyming words.</s>
schlee, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, these words rhyme. 
In this case, both the words "schlee-herronimo" have the same vowel sound (ee) at the end, which creates a rhyme between the words.</s>
quintessence, obsolescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes

These words rhyme because they follow the classic rhyme scheme of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, as indicated by the same consonant in the end (quintessence and obsolescence). The difference in the consonant sounds serves as the rhyme, demonstrating that they follow the rhyme rule.</s>
romances, advances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "romances" and "advances" both have a /ɔn/ vowel sound at the end, which is the same in both words, though the first word starts with "r" and the second word begins with "a". Despite these beginning consonants being different, the sound at the end of each word is identical, hence they rhyme.</s>
malignant, indignant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "malignant" and "indignant" do rhyme because they share identical vowel sounds (long "a" in both words) and have different consonant sounds but rhyme due to the consonantal pattern. 

"malignant" /məˈlainənt/ (m, a, l, i, n, a, n, t)
