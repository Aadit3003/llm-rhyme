These two words show alliteration but are not consecutive. The first word "miser-monitor" contains alliteration as "miser" sounds similar to "monitor." However, there is no alliteration or repetition of letters in the second word "monitor." It simply continues with the word "monitor" without any repetition of letters starting with the same sound.</s>

Therefore, it does not qualify as alliteration.</s>
iacona, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words iacona-boerner do not show alliteration. 

Explanation: In order to show alliteration, the same consonant sound must begin each of the words in a phrase or sentence.

In this sentence, the "a" and "b" sounds are alliterated. In the given words, "maue-mentioning" has a repetition of the "u" sound, but it is not the same as starting with "mau" sounds like "mu" in "maureen". Therefore, it does not display alliteration.</s>
