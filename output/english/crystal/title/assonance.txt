expo, jetro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "expo-jetro" show assonance. 

I determined this by examining the syllabic structure of both words with the following observations:

1. -expo- and -jetro: Both these parts of the word consist of the letter "e" which is pronounced as "a." Therefore, a listener would indeed notice the similar vowel sounds that contribute to the assonance between the two syllables.

2. Exposing the letter "e" is as pronounced in the first syllable of expo- and also in the fourth syllable of jetro. For the second syllable "jetro", the letter "j" is also pronounced as "a" (in the /jɛtro/ pronunciation, for instance).

3. Comparative syllabic structures: Although both words have two syllables, the syllable structure in "expo-jetro" is irregular and unstressed. This makes a difference when evaluating assonance, as unstressed syllables may not display the same degree of assonance.

Therefore, although the words are different and the assonance between them is weakened due to unstressed syllables, the principle of comparing the vowel sounds in both words is evident. Thus, the answer is "Yes" as "expo-jetro" show assonance.</s>
brawny, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "brawny-prom" show assonance. The repeated consonant sound "o" at the end of each word contributes to the assonance.</s>
patrol, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "patrol" and "O'Connor" show assonance, as they both begin with the same letter, 'p,' creating a pleasing sound effect in the phrase.</s>
muecke, snoops, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
calvano, armato, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "calvano-armato" show assonance. 

Assonance is a rhetorical device in which similar vowel sounds are repeated in words closely connected in a line of verse, or in prose. As both "calvano" and "armato" contain the repeated vowel sound "a," you can consider these two words to have a form of assonance within the given phrase.</s>
gauvin, mossad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. Gauvin and Mossad both end with the same vowel sound (a). Assonance is a figure of speech that occurs when similar vowel sounds are repeated in a word or sequence of words, creating a pleasing or rhythmic effect. In this case, the assonant sounds are "aw" in "Gauvin" and "a" in "Mossad."</s>
exemplum, tibetan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show assonance.

Assonance is when two or more words share the same vowel sound within a phrase or sentence. In this case, both the words "exemplum" and "tibetan" have the vowel sound of "a" in them, creating assonance. This type of language pattern can help make the phrasing of the sentence more pleasing and musical to the ear.</s>
szalay, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "szalay-haggart" show assonance. This is a form of internal rhyme in which the vocal sounds are similar at the end of words or within syllables, creating a musical flow in the text. In this case, the vowel sounds "a" and "ay" occur three times each, creating a pleasing phonetic effect.</s>
acid, shiller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "acid-shiller" show assonance because they share the same vowel sound ("a"). Assonance is a figure of speech where words are repeated with a vowel sound, and in this particular case, the repeated vowel sound "a" adds to an already distinct rhythm and flow to the words.</s>
sidi, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sidi-prima" show assonance due to the repetition of the "i" sound. The first part of the word ("sidi-") and the second part ("prima") both contain the "i" sound.</s>
jocular, wattenberg, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  The words "jocular" and "wattenberg" do not show assonance because they do not share a common vowel sound. Assonance refers to the repetition of vowel sounds within a phrase or sentence, and these two words do not exhibit that characteristic.</s>
kinny, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance.

The words "kinny-summerlin" do not exhibit any repetition of vowel sounds, which is the defining characteristic of assonance. As such, this is an example of a non-assonant rhyme rather than an assonant one.

Assonance involves repeated vowels or consonants within words - in the case of "kinny-summerlin," the only instance of a vowel ('a') is within the suffix "-summerlin", which comes after "kinny". As such, the only consonants repeated are 'n', which is the same consonant sound throughout the phrase, and this is not enough to qualify for the rhyme type we typically classify as "assonance".</s>
boyes, croix, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "boyes-croix" do not show assonance, as there is no specific vowel sound repeated throughout the word. As a result, it doesn't meet the criteria for assonance, which requires a repetition of a vowel sound within a syllable.</s>
shaul, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes. The word "shaul-bowron" does show assonance. When two or more stressed syllables match in sound in the same word, it is called consonantal assonance. But if we count the vowel sounds, the vowels make up for one letter out of every one word. Therefore, it's an instance of vowel assonance that may be more common in some languages than others due to the way certain language structures develop.</s>
sewed, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No.
Assonance is a literary device in which words with similar vowel sounds are used in close proximity to each other. In the given phrase, "sewed-reisenauer," there are no words with similar vowel sounds used in close proximity to create any distinct pattern of repetition. The words "sewed" and "reisenauer" appear without any clear pattern of similar vowel sounds, thus it does not demonstrate assonance.</s>
thee, yeas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "yeas" and "thee" show assonance. 

In this example, both words begin with the sound "ye-". This onomatopoeic sound - which resembles the sound produced when someone vocalizes the words - creates a connection between the words, and contributes to an overall sense of rhyming and sound repetition in the statement.

Assonance is one of the rhetorical devices used in poetry and literature to heighten the emotion or impact of a passage. It is the repetition of vowel sounds within words. In this case, the use of the similar-sounding vowels (a long "e" sound) creates a harmonious and pleasing flow to the sentence, making it more effective in conveying a message or affecting the reader's emotions.</s>
saunier, portier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "saunier-portier" show assonance. 

In the given phrase, both words start with the same letter "s" and end with the letter "t" ("s" and "t" are repeated in both the words). This repetition of vowel and consonant sounds is known as assonance.</s>
keanu, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, there is assonance present in the words "keanu-bahraini." Assonance is a rhetorical device that involves repetition of sounds within words. In this phrase, the '-a' sound is repeated, showcasing the presence and effect of assonance.</s>
lini, tsetse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes. Both words 'lini–tsetse' show assonance because they have a 't' sound in the middle, which creates a phonetic repetition effect, contributing to the sound and rhythm of the words.</s>
soeder, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "soeder-jimi" show assonance. Assonance is a literary device that involves the repetition of vowel sounds within a line of poetry. In this case, the repeated "oe" sound in "soeder" and "jimi" creates the assonance.</s>
lifer, piver, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lifer-piver" show assonance.

Justification: In poetry, assonance refers to repetition of vowel sounds in adjoining or nearby syllables. In the pair "lifer-piver," the repetition of the "e" vowel sound in "lifer" and "piver" creates an effect of rhyme and onomatopoeia, bringing forth a sense of unity and similarity in the sound quality between the two words. This creates a flow in the poem and adds to the overall beauty and auditory pleasure of the words.</s>
elicker, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words "elicker" and "jam" have the same vowel sound (ee) when pronounced separately, and that is what makes them harmonize. Therefore, they exhibit a form of syllabic-level assonance, as they share the same vowel sound within the same speech segment – a "short-vowel" assonance.</s>
seader, lacaze, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "seader-lacaze" show assonance. Assonance occurs when two or more words in a line of poetry share similar vowel sounds. In this case, the word "seader" has the same "a" sound as the word "lacaze," thus creating assonance. As a result, the word combination "seader-lacaze" exhibits a pleasing level of assonance, which can enhance the overall poetic quality of the text.</s>
heman, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
aside, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "aside" and "zeal" show assonance. This can be explained by the fact that both words contain a stressed "a" sound in the syllable before the vowel. "Aside" has a stress on the second syllable with 'a' sound (/əˈsaɪd/) while "zeal" has a stress on the second syllable with 'a' sound (/ziːl/). Both of them fulfill the condition of vowel sounds and a stressed vowel sound assonance.</s>
kiehn, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kiehn-jemmie" show assonance. 

Assonance occurs when two or more words share the same vowel sound within a line or phrase. In this case, "kiehn-jemmie" exhibits a repeated sound with a short i sound. This creates a rhyming or repetitive effect similar to a vowel rhyme or inner repetition.</s>

lerch, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance.</s>
tastier, hazier, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, there is no perceptible assonance between the words "tastier" and "hazier". 

To have assonance, there needs to be repetition of the same phoneme (vowel sound) in close sequence of adjacent words or sound units. In this pair of words "tastier-hazier," we can see the repetition of the consonant "s" sound, but it's not the same vowel sound, and the words don't share the same phoneme in close sequence needed for an assonant relationship. Therefore, assonance is not present.</s>
maisano, abbado, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "maisano-abbado" show assonance.

eno, expo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. 

In "eno-expo," the "-eno" suffix on the word "expo" creates harmony between the vowel sounds e and o in the two words, resulting in a pattern of similar vowel sounds that contributes to the word's rhythm and musicality. This is an example of assonance, which is a figure of speech that uses similar vowel sounds within words or phrases.</s>
biever, siemers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "biever" and "siemers" show some assonance. This is because both words share the same initial consonant sound and the letter "v" appears in the middle of the first word and the end of the second word, creating a partial matching of that sound between both words. Assonance is a literary device where repetition of sounds occurs.</s>
twats, dahlke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "twat" and "dahlke" show assonance because they have similar vowel sounds (the "a" sound) in close proximity. As a poetical technique, assonance helps enhance the rhythmic quality of the language and can provide a musical quality to the text.</s>

shadowed, anglos, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "shadowed-anglos" do not show assonance. Assonance is a poetic device that occurs when similar vowel sounds are repeated within a line of verse. In the given phrase, the words "shadowed-anglos" have homophones (words that sound the same but have different meanings) instead of similar vowel sounds, making it an example of homophony rather than assonance.</s>
sawed, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sawed-zell" show assonance. 

Justification: "Assonance" refers to the repetition of vowel sounds (or near vowel sounds) within a line of poetry or in words of a poem. In this case, there is a repetition of the vowel sound "a" in the hyphenated phrase "sawed-zell."</s>
gotten, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, there is no clear assonance in the words "gotten-castings." Assonance involves sounds within words that repeat, creating a similar effect to rhyme but requires a higher degree of onomatopoeia or internal resonance. However, the word "gotten" could potentially be considered as a potential assonance, but it doesn't fully fulfill the requirement for the assonance to be strong. It is important to note that assonance relies heavily on the internal sounds of words, and "gotten-castings" doesn't have enough internal sounds that closely align with each other to be deemed as satisfying the requirement for a strong internal resonance.</s>
wetsuit, zhengzhou, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "wetsuit-zhengzhou" show assonance. The term assonance refers to the occurrence of repeated vowel sounds in the same line or phrase.

sewed, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. 

Assonance occurs when multiple words in a sentence have repeated vowel sounds. In the example "sewed-smullen", we cannot clearly identify any words with repeated vowel sounds, nor can we find any pair of words with repeated vowel sounds that produce assonance. Thus, it cannot be considered a case of assonance.</s>
oslo, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the sound-similar words show assonance in the phrase "oslo-germer". The two words both have similar 'o' and 'r' sounds.</s>
sowder, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No. 

These words cannot be considered as showing assonance because "sowder" and "heman" do not share a repeating vowel sound. The only thing in common between these two words is the letter "h" and it is not used as a vowel sound. "Sowder" has a /z/ sound in the beginning and "Heman" has a /h/ sound in the end, but they don't share any other vowel sound. Therefore, assonance is not present in these two words.</s>
radosh, nepal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance because "radosh" and "nepal" both have the 'sh' sound at the end.</s>
shaine, swayze, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shaine-swayze" show assonance because the vowel sound, specifically the "a" sound in "shain" and "wayze," are pronounced similarly when they are grouped together in the same word.

magazine, battlefield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, this pair of words exhibits assonance. They both end in the letter "l" sound, which creates an auditory connection in the reader's mind when both words are spoken or considered together. This onomatopoeic ending helps emphasize the wordplay and adds to the overall poetic or lyrical quality of the phrase.</s>
misuse, renew, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words exhibit assonance. Assonance is a figure of speech where words with similar vowel sounds (either the same vowel sound or different vowels combined with the same consonant sound) are used. The words "misuse" and "renew" have similar sounding consonant letters in their vowel patterns, providing assonance between these two words.</s>
karoun, pursued, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "karoun-pursued" show assonance, as 'u' sounds are repeated in the words "pursued" and "karoun." This repetition of similar sounds (vowel sounds) contributes to the auditory pattern and helps to create emphasis in the words.</s>
seda, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "seda-healthy" do not show assonance. As far as the speaker's pronunciation goes, the words sound almost identical in the beginning and that could perhaps be causing the perceived similarity. But when it comes to the meaning that the individual words have, they bear no connection; the vowels and consonants each represent separate, independent words. They are not phonetically related. Therefore, they do not show assonance as defined in literature and linguistics. In literature, assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in a phrase while consonance is the repetition of short consonant sounds. Assonance and consonance are techniques often used to emphasize a certain point or create a musical effect in writing. In this case, 'seda' is a Polish word meaning 'sadness' or 'miserable state' and 'healthy' is a descriptor about a state or condition. There is no assonance or consonance going on here.</s>
patriots, chadian, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Patriots-Chadian" show assonance. 

The reason is that at the end of each word, the "t" sound is repeated: "P" in "Patriots" and "a" in "Chadian". This repetition of the sound creates a musical effect or rhythm, making the words more enjoyable to say and adding to the overall tone. 

Assonance is a figure of speech, a repeating sound-pattern or rhyme within words. In this case, the repeated "t" sound creates an assonance. It is a form of alliteration, where the words starts with the same letter or sound.</s>

The presence of assonance can be identified based on the common sound or vowel pattern shared among words or segments within a sentence. In this case, both words "kozar-lowder" contain the vowel sound "o," which is a common occurrence of assonance.</s>
gemmer, hammann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gemmer-hammann" show assonance. 

Assonance is a figure of speech that represents two or more vowel sounds occurring in the same line of poetry or across different stressed syllables in a single word. It can take the form of a syllabic alliteration (repetition of consonant sounds in a line) where it repeats the following vowel sound or it can represent a sound relationship where it creates a pattern or relationship between different vowels.

In the word "gemmer-hammann," the repetition of the vowel sound "ee" creates a simple assonance. So, the words "gemmer-hammann" display an instance of assonance. Assonance can enhance the sound and rhythm of a poem, adding to the overall effect of the work. It is considered a part of the rich rhythmic and musical qualities of language and poetry.</s>
kiene, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kiene-roesner" show assonance because the repeated sound of the vowel "e" between the two syllables ("kiene" and "roesner") strengthens the rhythm and emphasis of the two words, creating a pleasing musicality.</s>
petrelli, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "petrelli-hymen" show assonance. 

Justification: Assonance is a rhetorical device in which two or more words that are pronounced similarly are used in close proximity or sequence. 

In the words "petrelli-hymen", the "t" and "n" sounds are pronounced similarly as in the name "Petrelli" and the "m" sound as in "hymen". These sounds are closer together, creating an auditory connection by their similarity. This kind of parallelism, by means of word sound-pattern recurrence, results in the assonance.</s>
scholey, gitano, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. 

Assonance is a figure of speech where the stressed vowel sounds in a word or phrase are repeated in another word or phrase within a sentence. In "scholey-gitano," the two words share a vowel sound (sch) but do not repeat the vowel itself— the second word, "gitano," starts with the consonant sound 'g' instead of one of the vowels.</s>
essen, devils', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "essen-devils" show assonance. As a justification, consider that the last letter of each word, "s," sounds similar when pronounced. The 's' sound is often associated with the vocalization of a voiceless velar fricative. This similarity in pronunciation between the last letters of both words contributes to the assonance between them, as they are aligned phonetically and create a similar onset (start) sound. Thus, the word "essen-devils" showcases a form of assonance known as "onset assonance."</s>
yutzy, ulrey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "yutzy" and "ulrey" show assonance in the phrase "yutzy-ulrey".

Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within a word or between words. In "yutzy-ulrey", the short "u" vowel sound is repeated twice, which creates a similar effect to the "oo" vowel in "yutzy" and "ulrey". This repetition creates a musical quality in the phrase and enhances its overall effect.</s>
townshend, houseware, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance.

Explanation: In the word "townshend" and the homophone "houseware", the letters 's' and 'a' in both words have been pronounced with the same sound. This is an example of assonance, where characters in words are pronounced with the same sound or phoneme.</s>
maurer, pauper, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "maurer-pauper" show assonance, as both words share the "a" sound in the word "maurer." As a form of rhyme, it contributes to the overall musicality and flow of the words.</s>
emory's, cheverly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "emory's-cheverly" show assonance. Assonance occurs when two or more words, having the same (or nearly the same) vowel sound, sound at the same time. In this case, the words have assonant vowel sounds in the middle, specifically the doubled 'e' sound in "emory's" and "cheverly."</s>
dow's, shouts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dow's-shouts" show assonance between the -ow sounds. This is known as an alliteration, which is a figure of speech that occurs when words have similar sounds. In this case, the stress on the syllable "-ows" creates a repetition of the -ow sound, adding a rhythmic and musical element to the phrase.</s>
sawdey, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sawdey" and "reasner" show assonance because they both have the same vowel sound (a, short i) at the end of each word. This creates a pleasing and musical rhythm in the phrase.</s>
conti, army's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  In order to justify the presence of assonance in the given words, I will analyze their structures and syllable counts.

- "Con-ti-army's" contains four segments: "con," "ti," "army," and "s."

To determine if these word segments showcase an instance of assonance, we will first count the number of occurrences of consonants that are pronounced together:

- In the first segment "con", there is no pronounced consonant sound together.
- In the second segment "ti", this forms the schwa sound /ɪ/ or /i/.
- In the third segment "army", the 'r' sound is pronounced together with "ar." (The 'r' is silent in "ar-my.")
- In the final segment "s", it produces the schwa sound /s/ or /z/.

From this syllable analysis, we can see that the pronounced consonants ("con" and "ar") are indeed pronounced together in "Con-ti-army's." Consequently, we can justify that these words showcase an instance of assonance.

Answer: Yes, the words "Con-ti-army's" show assonance, as there are pronounced consonants (con and ar) that are pronounced together in the syllable structure of the words.</s>
becor, westfall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show assonance because they share the sound sequence "r-s-t" in the first syllable of each word. This creates a pleasing melodic effect and rhythm.</s>
kania, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. Assonance is a figure of speech in which the sounds of vowel or diphthong are repeated. In the words 'kania-bruner', the 'a' sound in 'kania' is repeated in 'bruner' to produce a pleasing effect. The repetition of consonantal sounds doesn't happen frequently enough to create consonance, so the presence of assonance holds its ground. In linguistic terms, 'bruner' and 'kania' follow the pattern of CVVV, with one 'v' vowel before a semivowel.</s>
garuda, mcluhan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "garuda-mcluhan" do show assonance. 

The reason is that the syllables in the word pair are repetitive, and they begin and end with the same sound. In this case, both words start with the sound "ga" and end with the sound "hn." This repetition of sound is what creates the assonance, which is a literary device that creates an emphasis on the repetition of a vowel sound within the word or phrase.</s>
pique, yeas, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in close proximity, while in "pique-yeas," the two words have different vowel sounds and are not near each other to create assonance.</s>
caen, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "caen-risner" show assonance. 

Assonance is a literary device where words that sound alike are placed consecutively or within a specific phrase. In "caen-risner," the '-a' sound in "caen" and "risner" is used, which creates an effect of similarity in pronunciation. This type of literary technique can make the text more interesting and memorable, as it can create a rhythmic and melodic flow.</s>
sheley, agerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sheley-agerton" do not show assonance. As a linguistic term, assonance refers to the repetition of vowel sounds in words, phrases, or lines of poetry. In this case, there is no clear vowel sound repetition in the given words, making them unable to demonstrate assonance.</s>
eichner, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "eichner-locatelli" show an example of assonance, as they both end with the sound "ei". This is a form of internal rhyme, which can add musicality and flow to the words.</s>
kearny, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kearny" and "sumerlin" show assonance, as both words start with the vocal sound "k" and continue with the consonant "n." This rhyming effect helps create musicality and emphasizes the relationship between the two words.</s>
joy's, croix, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

The words "joy's-croix" do not exhibit assonance because they do not share the same vowel sounds. Instead, they are a compound word with a hyphen. However, if we were to remove the hyphen and separate the words into their respective syllables, they could technically function as a part of an assonance scheme. For example, "joy" and "croix" could function as individual words with the same vowel sounds, such as "joy" sounding like "joy" and "croix" sounding like "croix" or both words sounding like "geo-crooks". So, to confirm, to answer your question in a more precise, positive but still not overly specific way, the answer would likely be something like: Yes, removing the hyphen and separating these words as individual components can potentially show assonance, although the current form of the words "joy's-croix" does not exhibit assonance.</s>
sader, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sader-primeaux" show assonance.

Assonance is a rhetorical device that refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry that is not necessarily at the beginning, middle, or end of the word (as in consonance). In the given phrase, the repetition of the same vowel sound (the "e" in "sader" and "primeaux") contributes to the assonance.</s>
schul, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "schul-noakes" shows assonance. This is because the repeated "l" sound occurs between the two words "schul" and "noakes". Assonance is a literary device in which words share the same vowel sound in a rhythmical or musical manner.</s>
gomer, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the two words in the phrase "gomer-encase" show assonance. The word "gomer" ends with the vowel sound /o:m/, which is repeated in the word "encase," where the second "e" also makes a vowel sound. This sound-to-sound repetition, known as onomatopoeia or alliteration, creates a rhythmic, musical effect in the phrase, which contributes to its poetic or lyrical qualities.</s>
elmhurst, theberge, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "elmhurst" and "theberge" show assonance. 

Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in the same line (nearly within syllables), rhyming with that of another. In this case, "u" sounds are repetitively used in both words, creating a sense of onomatopoeia and similarity between the words: "u-mhurst" and "u-e-b-e-r-g-e".</s>
erkkila, terminus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. 

In both words, the sound of the second syllable ([k] in "erkkila" and [s] in "terminus") matches the first syllable ([l] in "erkkila" and [n] in "terminus"). This repetition of a particular phonetic feature (both being a voiceless stop consonant at the same position in each word) creates the effect of assonance or a vowel rhyme.</s>
wipperfurth, tinkerer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "wipperfurth" and "tinkerer" show assonance, as they both have the sound "p" and "f" in the same position (i.e., "wipper" in "wipperfurth" and "pink" in "tinkerer").</s>
nyx, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "nyx-caen" show assonance.

In this case, both words have the "x" sound, which helps reinforce the literary device of assonance, which creates musicality and rhythmic emphasis in language.</s>
afmed, braswell, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "afmed-braswell" shows assonance because it contains the vowel sounds "a" and "a" in both words, creating a rhythmic repetition and similarity between the two words. This technique can make the language sound more musical and poetic, often used in literature or poetry.</s>
kanne, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance.

Assonance occurs when words with similar sounds are used in a sentence or phrase and create a rhythmic or musical effect. In the given word pair, "kanne" and "reierson," both possess the vowel sound "ee" which contributes to the assonance.</s>
lowder, boetcher, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lowder-boetcher" show assonance.

Assonance occurs when two or more words are pronounced, spelled, or sound alike, particularly in the vowel sounds. In this case, "lowder-boetcher" contains the vowel-like sounds "o," which are found in "lower" and "boetcher." This onomatopoeic effect contributes to the assonance in the word pair.</s>
cano, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. 

The words "cano-kapuscinski" show assonance because both words start with the consonants "c" and "k" followed by "o" and "p" respectively. The repeated sounds "o" and "p" create a pleasing and musical flow to the words, which is an example of assonance, a figure of speech that involves matching sounds.</s>
brazil, demisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "brazil-demisch" show assonance. The letters "z," "m," and "s" are pronounced together in the words "brazil" and "demisch."</s>
hermon, zaley, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "Hermon-Zaley" do not show assonance. 

Aspern-Garlic, 
Buffalo-Savannah, 
Cabinet-Rococo, 
Centaur-Sphinx, 
Chandler-Sparkler, 
Circle-Harmony, 
Crabbed-Baggage, 
Ecstasy-Oyster, 
Endgame-Ziggurat.

These words showcase assonance, where two or more words sound alike, usually sharing the same vowel sounds. 

In the words "Hermon-Zaley", while the first two letters are similar, and both words involve a pair of unrelated concepts, there is no sound-alikeness for the entire sound of either word. This indicates to me that the sound-related aspect to the concept of assonance is not demonstrated between these terms.</s>
behoff, seema, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "behoff-seema" show assonance. In this case, the "h" creates a consistent sound, creating a vowel-rhyme or sound-rhyme.</s>
soeder, gama, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No. These words do not show assonance as they do not match in sound or produce a similar sound pattern at the same positions in each word. Soeder-gama seems to be a name or a made-up word with no inherent rhyme or alliteration.</s>
roesner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do show assonance as both words "Roesner" and "Elcotel" contain the same vowel sound "o". As a defining characteristic of assonance, pronounced vowels match between words, making it stand out in the language.</s>

puffer's, runner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "puffer's-runner" shows assonance. 

The explanation: There is a pattern of near-rhymes within the words where 'u' and 'r' sounds are used repeatedly. This demonstrates a pattern of sounds that sound similar when spoken out loud, and that is characteristic of assonance. 'Puffer' and 'runner' both contain the repetition of the vowel 'u' as well as the consonant 'r' towards the end of the word, creating a distinct phonetic pattern. 

For example: 
 - Puffer: /ˈpʌfɚ/
 - Runner: /ˈrʌnər/

Both pronunciations end with similar sounds, making 'puffer's-runner' appear as though it has a repeating sound throughout the words which is what is referred to as assonance.</s>
kiene, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kiene-jammer" show assonance. Assonance occurs when words sound similar, creating a pleasant musical effect, and "jammer" and "kiene" both share the "y" sound in the middle of the word.</s>
kalis, fanning, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. Assonance is a literary device that occurs when two or more syllables in words sound alike. In this case, the "-a-" sound in "kalis" and "fanning" are similar, which contributes to the assonance.</s>
shill, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "shill-ken" do not show assonance. 

In the given phrase "shill-ken," there is a minor spelling mistake – the word "shilly-shally," usually, may be substituted for the correct word to show assonance. However, with the spelling error, the sound similarity ("sh-" in both words) becomes less pronounced, leading to a lack of assonance. Additionally, assonance typically implies repeated consonant sounds to emphasize the rhyme, but in this case, there's no significant consonant repetition.</s>
bossier, hollier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bossier-hollier" show assonance. Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within words, phrases, or lines of poetry. In this case, both words end with the same vowel sound, creating a sense of similarity and rhythm in the phrase.</s>
kutscher, guzzlers, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  ​</s>
luckie, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show any evident assonance, as they possess different sounds.

In the given words "luckie-germe," the only repeated sound is the 'k' sound in "luckie," but it's quite a minor association. Generally, assonance requires two or more words to have significant repetition of the same sound, especially in the middle or end of the word.

For instance, in the sentence "The rain falls gently on the rooftop," there is a clearer example of assonance: the vowel sound "ee" is repeated in "falls" and "rooftop."</s>

diners, piver, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "diners-piver" show assonance. 

As the assonance is between the vowel sounds of 'd-n-r-s' in 'diners' and the second 'r' in 'piver.' The repetition of these vowel sounds adds musicality and adds to the melody of the words. This is a type of literary device known as 'Repetition of vowel sounds,' called assonance. It helps in making the text pleasurable to read which enhances the literary value of the sentence or any literary work.</s>
schul, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show assonance because they both end with the same sound, "mammer." As a form of internal rhyme, assonance helps create a poetic effect and emphasize a particular word in the sentence.</s>
keeny, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  "Keeny-braner" does not exhibit clear assonance. While the word seems to have been intended to incorporate certain sounds, it doesn't really show assonance in a traditional linguistic sense. 

"Keeny-braner" consists of two syllables, each consisting of three consonant sounds (k, i, and n for the first syllable and b, r, and r for the second). The letters "n" and "r" in each syllable sound alike, which could be considered a form of onomatopoeia. But, in linguistic terms, they don't show assonance. Assonance is a literary figure that refers to the repetition of vowel sounds in the same language. 

For example, in the phrase "The raven and the phoenix," the vowels "a" and "e" and "oo" are repeatedly used to create a natural, recognizable pattern that could represent a deliberate choice by the author or simply a coincidence. But those words in "keeny-braner" don't do that. There's no clear vowel sound to repeat throughout the words; instead, the repeated letters create a play on the letter sounds but don't form consonant sequences that would suggest a vowel sound repetition. 

In conclusion, while "keeny-braner" could be considered an interesting linguistic oddity with its phonetic repetition of "braner," it does not demonstrate assonance in a traditional sense.</s>
shelly, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. Although "shelly" and "gaetano" both begin with the letter "s," there is no other repetition of a vowel sound (such as "a" or "ee") in either word, which is a defining characteristic of assonance.</s>

goyim, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "goyim-brion" exhibit assonance. Assonance is defined as a figure of speech in which a word is repeated in a sentence, and the repeated word or words begin with the same vowel sound. In this case, the repeated word "goyim" starts with the same vowel sound as the word "brion," which also begins with a vowel sound. This repetition of vowel sounds contributes to the poem or sentence's emphasis and creates a pleasing soundscape. So, in this context, the words are assonant.</s>
midpac, tristan, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. 

Assonance refers to the repetition of a vowel sound in a sequence of words. In this case, the repeated vowels are i and e in 'midpact' and 'tristan.' However, the combination 'mid-', 'tris-', and 't-' do not have any vowel sounds that are repeated consistently.</s>
aquino, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "aquino-sumerlin" do not show assonance. 

Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within a word or across multiple words. In "aquino-sumerlin," the repetition of the vowel sound "o" does not create a rhyme scheme, nor does it form an easily recognizable or consistent word or phrase. Therefore, assonance is not present in this example.</s>
sawed, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, there is assonance in the word "sawed-encase." This occurs when consecutive vowels sounds are repeated within the same word or phrase.

delicious, petitjean, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
cede, gomer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  I cannot physically "see" words to evaluate their onset or assonance, as the process of "seeing" relies on visual perception, but I can analyze the sounds of the words to determine if there is onset or assonance. Looking at "cede-gomer," there seems to be no clear pattern of repeated onset sounds to suggest assonance in these words. While both words do seem to contain consonant letters (c, d, g, m), the vowel sounds don't play a clear repeating pattern either. Therefore, my answer is:

No, there is no clear assonance in the words "cede-gomer."</s>
berated, effacing, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

This pair of words does not show assonance, as the consonant sounds are different. The first word, "berated," features the sound "b" at the beginning, while the second word, "effacing," has a "f" sound. The assonance would require the two words to end with similar sounds or share a common pattern, but they do not meet that criteria.</s>
elisa, nekia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "elisa-nekia" show assonance as they both end with the same sounding consonant letters ("i" in "elisa" and "a" in "nekia").

"Shrouds" and "lounge" both contain the vowel sound "oa" which is repeated in a rhythmic manner, contributing to an auditory satisfaction and aesthetic appeal in the phrase.</s>
mimicry, billingsly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
dugas, sewall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dugas-sewall" show assonance. 

Assonance occurs when two or more words in a line or phrase have similar vowel sounds. In "dugas-sewall," the repeated vowel "a" in "dugas" and "sewall" contributes to the presence and definition of assonance in the phrase.</s>
hurried, pursley, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hurried-pursley" show assonance.

Justification: As the term implies, assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within words. In "hurried-pursley," the vowel sound "u" is repeated between "hurried" and "pursley." This creates a pleasing sound to the ear, making the phrase more poetic and memorable.</s>
lick, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lick-germe" show assonance because the vowel sounds "ich, ik, ik" in the first and last consonant clusters are pronounced in close succession. This creates a pattern of repetition of vowel sounds, giving "lick-germe" a rhythmic and musical quality.</s>
cartilage, pondimin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cartilage-pondimin" show assonance. 

Assonance occurs when two or more words in a line of text have similar vowel sounds. In this case, the '-imin' element in each word has similar vowel sounds, which creates the assonance.</s>
you're, tooke, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, there is no assonance in the words "you're-tooke." 

First, I analyze the words: "you're-tooke."
The "you're" is a contraction of "you are," which is a single word.
The "tooke" refers to the past participle of the verb "take," which is also a single word.

Since these words are separate and not connected phonetically, it is not appropriate to discuss assonance. They do have one thing in common since "you" starts with the same sound as "took." However, this is a case of word-initial assonance, which should not be considered "assonance" as per the definition.</s>
dicky, wintry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dicky-wintry" show assonance. As the "i" sound sounds like the "i" sound in "dicky."</s>
enix, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "enix-coiner" show assonance due to the shared letter "n" in each word. Assonance occurs when multiple words, phrases, or syllables within a sentence or verse sound alike in terms of vowel sounds. In this case, the /n/ sound is repeated, creating assonance and adding rhythm to the phrase.</s>
laidlaw, brainstorm, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. They do not share any repeated consonant sounds in the same position of the syllable. "Laidlaw" has words that end in "d" and end in "d", but there is no word in "brainstorm" that ends in a consonant sound that matches any of the consonants in "laidlaw." 

In "laydlaw" and "brainstorm", the only similar thing is that each is a combination of one or more syllables with two identical vowels (ay and ou in each of "laylaw" and "brainstorm"). This doesn't fulfill the rules of assonance because it is just two identical vowels in each word. Therefore, they are not examples of any type of assonance.</s>
musco, rudow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "musco-rudow" show assonance. 

Assonance is a figure of speech that occurs when similar vowel sounds are repeated within a word or words. In this case, the -u- sound is repeated twice in "musco-rudow," making it a prime example of assonance.</s>
shadows, gatos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance, as they both begin with the same sound 's-g'. Assonance is a figure of speech where words with similar sounds are used within a sentence or phrase, creating a musical or rhythmic effect.</s>
negev, telexed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "negev-telexed" show assonance. Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within a line of poetry. In this case, the term "negev" shares the vowel sound /ɛ/ at the end of the word, and the syllable "negev" is pronounced as /nɛɡv/. The syllable "telexed" shares the sound /eks/ in the word "exceed" which gives us a distinct vowel sound repetition. Therefore, these words exhibit a form of assonance.</s>
duly, kuney, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "duly" and "kuney" do not show assonance because they do not have vowel sounds that match one another. The consonant sounds in both words are essentially completely different. This makes it clear that they do not show a form of assonance called assonance or alliteration. It's possible "duly" and "kuney" could be a play on words, but not assonance.</s>
ireson, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ireson" and "brawny" show assonance. In this case, assonance occurs when two or more words in a sentence or text produce a repetition of specific sounds, such as the sound of the letter "r" in "ireson" and "brawny."</s>
shoplifts, roddick, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shoplifts-roddick" do show assonance.

Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in words that are not necessarily close together in the sentence. In this case, it is "op" in both "shoplifts" and "roddick" that sound alike. This creates a pattern that makes the sentence sound more pleasing to the listener.</s>
alcoa's, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance due to the repetition of the 'o' sound. Alcoa's has an initial "a" and "o" sound, and prima has an "o" sound, which creates the assonance.</s>
kania, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kania-gemme" exhibit assonance. Assonance is a figure of speech that occurs when words with similar vowel sounds (consonance between vowels) are used in close proximity to each other. In this case, "kania" and "gemme" are used as connected words and share the same vowel sound in the -a- portion of the word, which creates an example of assonance.</s>
appraise, mcclain, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words "appraise" and "mcclain" show assonance.

The reason for the Yes answer is due to the repetition of the "e" sound in both of the words. In both "appraise" and "mcclain," the letter "e" is pronounced in both syllables. This repetition of similar sounds within the words, known as vowel harmony or assonance, contributes to their rhythm and sound. The assonance in these words creates a pleasing effect when spoken or written, creating a musical or poetic effect.</s>
kuennen, huegel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance between the vowel sounds 'uen' in 'kuennen' and 'ng' in 'huegel'.</s>
pyro, heico's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. Assonance requires two or more sounds within a phrase or word to be repeated. In the phrase "pyro-heico's," there is only one repeated sound, which is 'o' in "pyro-heico," while another 'o' exists in 'heico'. Therefore, it is not an example of assonance.</s>
forry, doughtie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "forry-doughtie" show assonance. Assonance occurs when two or more words within a sentence, word, or phrase share the same vowel sound, in this case, the 'r' sound.</s>
sader, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show assonance because they have a similar vowel sound - "a" - in the middle of each word. Assonance is a literary device that occurs when two or more words in the same sentence have the same vowel sound. Such pattern contributes to rhythm and emphasizes the given word or phrase.</s>
bantu, caruth, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "bantu-caruth" do not exhibit assonance.

Justification: In this case, there are no repeated consonant sounds to form a rhyme between the two words, hence it does not represent a case of assonance. Assonance depends on the repetition of vowel sounds or consonants sounds in a phrase or sentence. Since there is no such repetition in "bantu-caruth", it does not indicate the presence of assonance.</s>
shelley, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shelley" and "lookers" show assonance, as they have the phonetic sound "l" at the end of each word, creating a rhythmic and matching pattern within the sentence. This type of sound repetition is known as assonance.</s>
next, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "next-jama" show assonance.

In English, assonance is a literary device that refers to the repetition of vowel sounds within words. In this case, the vowel sound "a" is repeated in both "next" and "jama," which helps create a musical rhythm and promotes a sense of smoothness to the words.</s>
terrorist, pecanins', Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not exhibit assonance. The term "assonance" refers to a literary device where words with similar sounds are used, usually rhyming or having close vowel sounds. 

In the given phrase, "terrorist-pecanins," although the words are similar in terms of the long "a" sound in "terrorist," they don't rhyme and do not use a repeating vowel sound to create any close phonetic relationship between the words. Instead, the use of a hyphen serves to separate the two words, which are not consonant with each other in terms of meaning or context.

Furthermore, the word "pecanins" is not a standard English word and seems to be a typo or word slurred for "pecan". To determine if assonance is present based on sound similarity, a word or set of words that includes recognizable words, accurate spelling or correct vowel sounds is necessary.</s>
walker's, pauper, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not exhibit assonance.

Assonance occurs when two or more words in a sentence or passage share the same vowel sound. In the phrase "walker's-pauper," the vowel sound of the first syllable (-walker) does not match the vowel sound in the second syllable (-pauper). As a result, assonance is not present. Assonance can be seen in sentences where words that appear to share vowel sounds do, in fact, share them - like in "daughter's-dress."</s>
easel, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "easel-kain" show assonance because the /k/ sound is repeated in both syllables, creating a parallelism in the rhyme scheme.</s>

hamner, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words "hammer" and "brun" show assonance. The -am and -an vowel sounds in "hammer" and "brun" partially overlap and sound similar, contributing to an audible similarity between the two words.</s>
kanner, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kanner-bowron" show assonance as they both have the consonant sound /n/: "kanner" and "bowron." Assonance is a figure of speech or writing style that uses similar vowel sounds within a line of verse or text.</s>
kania, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kania" and "sumerlin" show assonance as they both have the "a" sound at the end of the word. This occurs because the two words share a similar vowel sound, providing a sense of musicality and rhythm when they are pronounced together.</s>
melone, nkohse, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show any sign of assonance. The words "melon" and "nkohse" are separate words and do not have any vowel sounds that rhyme with each other.</s>
schley, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Schley-Guertin" show assonance, as both words have the vowel sound of "i" (pronounced as "ee") in the middle.</s>
knieriem, beastly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "knieriem" and "beastly" show assonance. Assonance occurs when words or sounds with similar vowel sounds are used in proximity to one another. In this case, the similarity in the vowel sounds between "knieriem" and "beastly" is what creates the assonance.</s>
dairy, neni's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show assonance as they both end in the vowel sound "-y", which is a common way to create rhyme and repetition when using rhyming words. Assonance can be a helpful tool for emphasizing certain sounds in a sentence.</s>
sowder, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sowder" and "gettin'" show assonance. Assonance occurs when identical vowel sounds are repeated in a sequence of words. In this case, the vowel sounds "o" and "a" are pronounced in both "sowder" and "gettin'."</s>
horn's, hmong, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the provided words do not show assonance, as there is no repeated consonant sound across the words "horn" and "hmong." Assonance involves the repetition of a consonant sound, so the only overlap in these words is the vowel sound between "horn" and "hmong." The words "horn" and "hmong" do, however, share a consonant sound: the "h" sound. But since this is not a repeated consonant sound, assonance is not present in these words.</s>
boschen, orchid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "boschen-orchid" show assonance.

As a form of internal repetition of vowel sounds, assonance helps to strengthen and rhythmically organize language, making words or phrases easier to remember. In this case, the pair of words "boschen" and "orchid" have both the vowel sound "os" in similar positions. This repetition of the vowel sound gives the words a pleasing musical quality, creating a sense of rhythmic unity.</s>
seder, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance because the 'r' sound is repeated in both words - "seder" and "enix". This repetition of the same phonetic sound creates rhyme and harmony.</s>
irving, gerwin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "irving-gerwin" show assonance. Assonance is when words with the same vowel sound appear close together within a line of text. In this case, the "e" sound in "irving" and "gerwin" are pronounced in both words.</s>
panther's, gafford, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "panther's-gafford" shows assonance. However, assonance does not have a strict definition, and a single instance of consonant repetition may not necessarily be considered as such in the literary context. In this case, "p" sounds (panther / gafford) are repeated, creating a pleasing and musical effect, which can be considered an instance of assonance.</s>
restroom, zhengzhou, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "restroom-zhengzhou" do not show any type of assonance, assonance is a literary device that involves recurring vowel sounds. Looking at the words "restroom-zhengzhou," there is no clear repetition or matching vowel sounds making them appear to share a common or linked sound effect to be considered as a cohesive and significant aspect of assonance in literature or language.</s>
towey, shoji, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. Assonance is a figure of speech where words or sounds are repeated to create a musical effect. In this case, the /oo/ sound is repeated in the words "towey" and "shoji," which adds to the rhythm and musicality of the phrase.</s>

largeness, dotting, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "largeness-dotting" show assonance because they both contain the consonant "g" sound at the end which is repeated with a short vowel sound ("e" in "largeness"), creating a pattern of sounds.</s>
knicks', elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "knicks'-elcotel" do not show assonance. 

Assonance refers to the repetition of vowel sounds within the same line or stanza. Here, the "-" (hyphen) is included, which disrupts the flow of the words' vowel sounds, making it challenging for them to qualify as assonance.</s>
incase, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance due to the absence of any vowel sounds with similar pronunciation. In case-gemme, the first word has a different vowel sound at the beginning, and the "-e" at the end of "case" also contributes to distinct pronunciation. The second word, "gemme," consists of two separate French terms, "gé" meaning water and "mm" likely a wordplay on "mousse," meaning foam. Although mousse can be pronounced similarly to the ending of "gemme," it doesn't create assonance as both words share distinct sounds without any shared vowel sounds.</s>
beings, feasted, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "beings-feasted" show assonance.

In this phrase, both words end with the same sounding letter (in this case, the sound of the letter 'd'). This repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words is called assonance.</s>
lariccia, canida, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lariccia" and "canida" show assonance. Assonance occurs when words with similar vowel sounds appear close together in a sequence. In this case, the repeated 'a' sound in "lariccia" and the double 'a' vowel sound in "canida" create a pleasing, repetitive pattern, which contributes to the overall sound and meaning of the phrase.</s>

thereto, legume, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "thereto" and "legume" show assonance. 

Assonance is a rhetorical device that uses the repetition of vowel sounds, without necessarily consonant repetition. In the phrase "thereto-legume", the repetition of the vowel sound "oo" in "thereto" and the second syllable of "legume" creates an ear-catching pattern. This rhetorical technique can make the text sound more musical, and thus, can contribute to the speaker's or writer's effectiveness.</s>
puffer's, lutter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. The presence of "f" sounds repeated in "puffer's-lutter" contributes to an increased musicality and rhythmic effect, which can be considered as an example of assonance. Assonance involves the repetition of specific sounds within a line of poetry, creating a musical and rhythmic effect similar to that of a song or melody.</s>
hugo's, buffo, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "hugo's-buffo" do not show assonance. 

Assonance occurs when two or more vowel sounds within a sequence of words are the same. In the given sentence "hugo's-buffo," the only vowel sound is that of "o" which is repeated at the end of both words. Since the vowel sounds are not the same, assonance cannot be considered.</s>
sowed, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sowed" and "kearn" do not show assonance. Assonance occurs when words in a line of poetry, usually within the same measure, sound alike or reproduce (as in phonetic imitation) the vowel sounds of the preceding words or syllables. In "sowed-kearn," the two words share an initial consonant sound ("s-") but do not share any other phonetic similarities or vowel sounds. Therefore, this does not qualify as assonance in poetry.</s>
arbo, vasko, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "arbo-vasko" exhibit assonance.

Explanation: Assonance is a figure of speech in poetry where two sounds in different words are similar. In this case, the "o" sound is repeated in both words, creating an effect of harmony or similarity between the words, contributing to the sound and rhythm of the language.</s>
traxler, gafford, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "traxler-gafford" show assonance. 

Assonance is a device in language when two or more words or syllables in a series sound the same because of the repetition of vowel sounds (with or without the presence of consonants). In "traxler-gafford", the words have repeated the vowel "a" sound. Therefore, it is an example of assonance.</s>
skibicki, devinci's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. 

In the phrase "skibicki-devinci's," the -ci ending in both words creates a common vowel sound, which is a form of assonance - in this case, it is a diphthong sound (/ski/ and /bi/). This technique is often used to create a pleasing or poetic effect in language.</s>
brion, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "brion-jam" show assonance. As an artificial intelligence, I am programmed to identify linguistic patterns, and in this case, the repeated sound of "r" in the first and last word creates an aural effect that is characteristic of assonance.</s>
swasey, conti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "wasey-conti" show assonance. 

Assonance occurs when multiple successive vowel sounds are repeated within a line of poetry or a phrase. It creates a musical quality to the language and creates a melodic flow. In this example, the words "wasey-conti" have two vowel sounds, "a" and "o," at the beginning and end of the word, respectively. These vowel sounds are repeated twice throughout the word. This is an example of a consonance-assonance phenomenon in language.</s>
oecd, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oecd-lockers" show assonance, as there is a sound similar to the letter "e" repeated in some of the letters.</s>
silsby, schuller, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. In the word combination "silsby-schuller," there is no repeated vowel sound.

orson, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Orson-prom" show assonance. 

In language, assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in adjacent or nearby syllables within a line of poetry or a word within a sentence. In the words "Orson-prom," the repeated "oo" sound creates an onomatopoeic effect, as in the word "prom," which is a specific event that involves a group dance held during or after the school year, typically promoting the concept of adulthood and ritual courtship. This repetition of the 'oo' sound creates an interesting sound effect for the word.</s>
breon, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes. The words "breon-primeaux" show assonance, as both words have the vowel sound "oo" in the second syllable.</s>
game, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance because the '-ea' sound in both words is being repeated. The speaker is potentially using a play on words, where "game-roesner" is a made-up phrase or mash-up of the words "gameroes," which implies the speaker is speaking in an invented or fictional language or role-playing.</s>
basks, frans, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "basks-frans" show assonance. 

Assonance is a literary device that involves the repetition of vowel sounds within a line of poetry or a word within a sentence, creating a pleasing effect on the reader's ear.

carpio, stasio, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "carrpio" and "stasio" show assonance. 

Assonance is repetition of vowel sounds in adjacent or closely related words. By having the "r" sound consistently in both words, despite the different spelling and consonant initials, it creates a sense of harmony and connection between the words, which is what gives this word pair its assonance. Assonance serves to emphasize and beautify language by sound, reinforcing the meaning of words and enhancing the music of the poem or speech.</s>
shampine, azides, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words show assonance to the extent that they both begin with the same vowel sound ("sh" vs. "a"), but they do not have much of a relation beyond that. As an AI, I cannot determine whether the speaker intended for these words to be viewed as assonant.</s>
necaise, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "necaise-reierson" show assonance. 

Justification: Assonance is a figure of speech that creates a correlation between the sounds of vowels, especially the same vowel sounds in different words. In the given phrase "necaise-reierson," the repeated vowel sound "e" within the words "necaise" and "reierson" creates assonance.</s>
balodia, hagopian, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "balolia-hagopian" show assonance.

augusta, abduction, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
geis, eilts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'geis-eilts' demonstrate assonance. 

Assonance occurs when words that are pronounced in the same way, or have similar vowel sounds, appear in close proximity to each other. Here, 'geis' and 'eilts' both share the vowel sound of the letter 'e', thus it's considered as an example of assonance.</s>
kain, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "kain-jam" do not show assonance.

As an AI language model that generates assonance, "kain-jam" is a single compound word formed from the words "kain" and "jam". There is no actual assonance present in this word as it does not feature any repeat of vowels or a repeated consonant sound. Assonance typically involves the repetition of sounds within words, such as rhyming. In order to demonstrate assonance, it should result in repeated sounds that are pronounced with the same emphasis or quality.</s>
soleil, roget, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in similar ways in a line of poetry. However, there is a small sound similarity between "soleil" (sun) and "solet" (sole, footwear material). But, there's no direct sound repetition between "soleil" and "roget".</s>
schley, oelkers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schley" and "oelkers" show assonance. Assonance occurs when words with similar vowel sounds are used in close proximity, creating an auditory effect that can enhance the overall sound and rhythm of a passage.

cano, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "cano-bruney" do not exhibit assonance. They share the sounds of "o" in "canoe" and "y" in "bruney," but this is a mere coincidence of the word structures rather than assonance which requires two or more rhyming phonemes in the same line of poetry or verse.</s>
roath, hoechst's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
goyim, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance.

Assonance refers to the repetition of vowel sounds within a word or across words in a sentence. In this case, both "goyim" and "Jammu" have the same vowel sound, "o," creating a similar-sounding pair of words that exhibit assonance.</s>
worked, third, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No. While "worked-third" does appear to have an interesting pattern with the initial "w" sound repeated in both words, it doesn't meet the strict definition of assonance which requires the words to be pronounced almost identically. "Worked" is pronounced more like "workeh," while "third" has a more typical pronunciation. Therefore, the words do not exhibit true assonance.</s>
habitats, avalanche, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, assonance can be observed in the phrase "habitats-avalanche" because the endings of the two words create an almost identical sound. Both words have syllables that rhyme with each other, which contributes to the overall musicality and sound similarity of the phrase.</s>
khanna, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show assonance because they both have the sound "k" at the beginning. Assonance is a figure of speech in which the repetition of vowel sounds within a word or between words emphasizes and strengthens the sound effect for a particular syllable or phrase. In this case, the syllables "kh" and "pr" are being repeated.</s>
o'shell, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. Assonance is a figure of speech that occurs when there is a repetition of vowel sounds within a word or a phrase. In the phrase "o'shell-priam," there are no vowels repeated, and thus it does not demonstrate assonance.</s>
wetsuit, jeju, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance because they both end with the same vowel sound: /ju/.</s>
seider, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. The sounds of 'r' and 'm' in "seider-gemma" are pronounced in the same way as in the word "assonance."</s>
boerner, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word pair "boerner-jaimie" shows assonance. Assonance occurs when like vowel sounds are repeated in a sequence of words (in this case, the 'i' sound is repeated), creating a flowery or musical effect. In this case, the initial and final consonants of each word, 'b' and 'y', sound quite similar and help bring out the assonance between the two words.</s>
raffish, blanchett, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. 

Explanation: 
In the given words "raffish" and "blanchett," the "f" sound is carried through to the neighboring vowel sound in both words. This creates an effect known as assonance, where multiple occurrences of the same vowel sound occur within a given word or sentence, often adding rhythm and emphasizing the syllables carrying the same vowel sound.</s>
nex, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. The sound of "nx" in "nex-easily" is repeated in the second syllable of the word, creating a pleasing and pronounceable effect for readers.</s>
vim, spic, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "vim-spic" can be considered to exhibit an example of assonance in their spelling, as both words start with the sound "v." As mentioned in my previous responses, this is a form of internal rhyme where words share vowel sounds (e.g., "spoke-to, rocokolo").</s>
army's, qawi, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. 

The reason is, the word "army's-qawi" should be separated. "Army's" is a possessive form, which refers to something belonging to the army. The word immediately following 'army's' should be '-qawi' and not '-s' or hyphen (as '-' would act as a symbol for decimal point and is not considered valid in a word). So the right combination for these words can be either - "Army's Qawwali" or "Army's-Qawwali". When the hyphenated form is corrected, it would look something like this: "Army's Qawwali"

However, in the corrected form, both 'Q' and 'w' at the end sound differently (thereby not being assonant), which may change the rhythm and sound of the line.</s>
jojoba, jocosa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "jojoba-jocosa" show assonance between the "o" sound in "jojoba" and "jocosa".</s>
vim, steere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "vim-steere" show assonance. The -i and -e sounds are repeated in succession, creating a pleasing and smooth onset effect for the ears. However, assonance alone isn't enough to categorize them as words and it's important to have a context where these words can function for them to be meaningful as well.</s>
shewmake, two-way, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "shewmake" and "two-way" do not show assonance.

Justification: Assonance refers to the repetition of vowel sounds in adjacent vowels or syllables. In the given words "shewmake-two-way," there are no adjacent vowels with the same sound, so they do not exhibit assonance.</s>

thee, lee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. 

In the words "thee-lee," the "ee" sound is repeated, which is an example of assonance, a rhetorical device used in poetry and literature to highlight syllables and create literary effects.</s>
freres, vents, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes. Assonance is a figure of speech which occurs when words with the same vowel sound or consonance patterns are used close together. In this case, 'frere' and 'vents' are two words that have a vowel sound similar (in Spanish, an "e" pronounced as "ay" or "ee" is similar to an "e" in English). Hence, they show assonance. Therefore, yes, the words 'freres-vents' show assonance.</s>
incase, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance.

In the words "incase-khanna", the letter "a" is pronounced at the end of both words, making the vowel sounds similar. This is an example of vowel repetition, which contributes to the overall sound pattern and rhyme scheme of the words.</s>
hoechst's, poe's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. 

Assonance refers to the repetition of vowel sounds within a word or words, while the given words "hoechst's-poe's" only share one vowel sound ('o') within a hyphen which does not constitute assonance. Even then, it's less than 3 vowel sounds.</s>
taddeo, carpio, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'taddeo' and 'carpio' show assonance in the phrase 'taddeo-carpio'. 

Assonance is a figures of speech where similar sounds in words are used, and in this case, both 'taddeo' and 'carpio' share the long 'a' sound, creating a similar effect to the sound pattern 'tah-doww-kaar-pee-oh'. This creates a pleasing or connected sound in the language.</s>
hymen, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show assonance because the "m" and "n" sounds are repeated. The words "hymen-cannery" create a visual and auditory effect due to this repetition, which can enhance the reader's experience and further the literary impact of the sentence.</s>
bourguiba, malvinas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'bourguiba' and 'malvinas' show assonance because they both end with the sound /v/.</s>
sowder, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sowder-enix" do not show assonance. As a poetical device, assonance involves repeated vowel sounds within words and is commonly used to improve a piece of literature's rhythm. However, "sowder-enix" does not have any distinct vowel sounds to create such repetition, making it unsuitable for representing assonance.</s>
acid, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. 

In the phrase "acid-gettin'", the '-g' sound is repeated twice. This repetition of vowel sounds (in this case, 'g') through the word builds rhythm and consonance, which is often considered as a form of assonance. So, when we have words that sound similar in this way, we usually call this assonance.</s>
armon, bottled, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'armon' and 'bottled' show assonance as both end in the letter 't'.</s>
guertin, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show assonance because they both end with the same sound, "in-". The consonant "i" in "guertin" and "prima" is repeated in two consecutive syllables, providing a similarity in pronunciation through the repeated consonant sound. Therefore, it could be considered as a form of onomatopoeia or assonance between the two words, indicating a connection through the shared ending characteristic.</s>
frans, scam, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "frans-scam" shows minor assonance between the vowels at the end of each word, specifically between the 'a' and 's' sounds in "frans" and "scam". However, the assonance is not very noticeable as it occurs only within the two word itself, and not between two words in the phrase.</s>
sloboda, atonement, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. 

The word "sloboda" has some similarity in sound with the word "atonement," but assonance requires pairs of words with the same sound in two different parts of a sentence or phrase. In this case, the individual words alone do not demonstrate assonance.</s>
obeyed, rogaine, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. Assonance occurs when words with similar or the same vowel sounds are used in close proximity. In this case, the words "obeyed" and "rogaine" share the same vowel sound "oa" in the word "rogaine." This creates a pleasing sound and potentially enhances the meaning or the rhythm of the sentence.</s>
guertin, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

canny, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "canny-electoral" show assonance.

The definition of assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in the same line or phrase. "Canny" has the vowel sound /ænsi:/, and "electoral" has the vowel sound /ɛlɪˈtɒrəl/ (which includes the /l/ sound). The repetition of the /eɪ/ vowel in both words, even if it's pronounced slightly differently, still maintains the same vowel sound family and therefore creates assonance.</s>
niehoff, seymour's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. There is a single vowel sound in "niehoff" (pronounced like "neighoff") and a double vowel sound in "seymour" (pronounced like "seymoor"), which are separate words, so no assonance can be found between them. The pronunciation of the respective words are different and not related.</s>
berated, misplaces, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "berated-misplaces" show assonance, which is the repetition of vowel sounds in the adjacent or near-adjacent letters of a word or phrase.

To illustrate, assonance is a figure of speech that occurs when words are pronounced (or written) with similar sounds in close proximity. For example, words like "laughter," "shawl," or "spilled" might have assonant sounds. In the words "yoshio-polito," the only assonant sounds occur when "yoshio" and "polito" are pronounced. However, they do not share the same syllable structure or are connected by a vowel sound. Therefore, it is considered not to show assonance.</s>
hamner, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance.</s>
sarni, qawi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do show assonance. 

Here is the step-by-step analysis:

1. Identify the sound pattern. Assonance involves repetition of the same vowel sound. In this case, both words (sarni-qawi) have the same vowel sound, specifically 'ai.' 

Justification:

* The word "sarni-qawi" consists of two syllables: 'sarni' and 'qawi.' The first and last syllables both have the vowel 'ai,' providing an example of a consonant-vowel-consonant pattern (CV-C) which is a common structure for assonance.

* The word "qawi" consists of only one syllable and also carries the 'ai' vowel sound, making it an example of a single-syllable word carrying the assonance.

* Therefore, the presence of the 'ai' vowel sound in both words, regardless of their individual syllabic structure, contributes to the assonance effect. The word "qawi" acts as an exemplar for the assonance pattern, and the word "sarni-qawi" demonstrates how the same sound pattern can be repeated with a different initial consonant ("s" in this case) and a different final consonant ("-qawi"). This fulfills the criteria for showcasing assonance.</s>
schuele, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance.

Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within a word or a phrase. The words "girten-summerlin" consist of different vowel sounds, making them assonant in this context. However, the repetition of these vowel sounds does not follow the criteria of true assonance, which involves the same vowel sound in a phrase. In this case, the repetition is due to different vowels in each word, making them appear assonant, but not actually assonant.</s>
lilli, stickney, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance.

The words "lilli-stickney" do not share any specific vowel sound. To show assonance, the syllables of the words must share the same vowel sound, which is not the case with "lilli" and "stickney".</s>

delmed, negev, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, there isn't any assonance between the two words "delmed" and "negev". Although the individual letters of the words share some similarities, such as repeating the "e" sound in both words, the words themselves don't have a coherent consonantal pattern that is repeated or consonantally similar in both words. As such, they do not exhibit assonance.</s>
threadbare, telexed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance.

In the words "threadbare-telexed," the "t" and "d" sounds in "telexed" appear together, and the "r" sound in "threadbare" matches the "r" sound in "telexed." This creates an effect of the same sound repeated in close proximity, which is known as assonance.</s>
avnet, caswell, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Avnet-Caswell" show partial assonance. This is because the letter 'a' appears twice in the word, in the first and fourth letters.
There is assonance because "a" is a close-to-each-other repetition in these words. But still, the pronunciation will be different. For proper pronunciation it is also necessary to check other parts of the sentence along with initial letter(s).</s>
naina, ribald, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show assonance because both words have the vowel sound "ai" in them. In this case, the first letters of each word ("na" and "ri") share the phonetic feature of the same vowel sound, thus creating a pattern and adding a poetic effect.</s>

Assonance is a literary device where words with similar vowel sounds are used in close proximity, creating a musical effect. In this case, the repetition of the "ew" sound at the ends of the words "sewed" and "schul" creates the desired effect, making the words sound similar.</s>
behoff, leon, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "behoff-leon" show assonance, as both words have a "f" sound (soft "f" sound) in their spelling which creates a similar effect to the "o" sound in "asthma". Assonance is an artistic technique that uses repetition of vowel sounds in a sentence, phrase or word.</s>
roath, poe's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the phrase "roath-poe's" shows assonance. The repeated sound of the "a" and "o" in "roath" and "poe" create a recurring and emphasized pattern, creating a pleasing linguistic effect called assonance.</s>
aickin, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. Assonance occurs when two or more words, whether separate or adjacent, sound almost alike due to their vowel sounds or the presence of a repeated vowel sound, such as "laugh" and "love" (the "ah" sound), or "bath" and "cat" (the "ah" sound). "Aickin-rosene" has a single vowel sound change from "a-ickin" to "a-rosene," which does not create any recognizable assonance.</s>
shill, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
audi, chaussee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "audi-chaussee" exhibit assonance because the first two letters of each word start with the sounds "au," which is repeated in the second syllable "i-chaussee".</s>
multiprocessor, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not show assonance because they do not have any repeating letter sounds, which is a characteristic of assonance. In "multiprocessor-jammu," the first word, "multiprocessor," is made up of words that have the vowel sound 'p' at the end: mult-i (with the -i sound), and -processor, which also has the 'p' sound. However, the second word, "jammu," has entirely different vowel sounds: 'j' and 'u'. There is no alignment of letter sounds within the vowel sequences that makes them assonant with each other or within the first word.</s>
sheeler, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. 

Since assonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within words, in this case, the words "sheeler-hermann" do not share any consonant sounds in common that would create a consistent pattern of assonance among them.</s>
nancy's, frankly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "nancy's" and "frankly" show assonance, as both end in the vowel sound "i". This technique of repetition of vowel sounds within a sentence (usually of different syllables) is known as assonance.</s>

In the given words "cod-ken", "cod" and "ken" both contain the vowel sound "o" which creates the assonance between the words.</s>
fusco, hugo's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "fusco-hugo's" show assonance due to the repetition of the 'o' sound in the words. Assonance is a figure of speech that occurs when two or more stressed syllables, usually vowels, in a sequence appear with the same vowel sound (phoneme), regardless of whether it is the same or different vowel sound. In this case, both "fusco" and "hugo" have the same 'o' sound, making them assonant with each other. Thus, the words "Fusco-Hugos" showcase an instance of assonance.</s>
danjub, caruth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "danjub-caruth" show assonance. Assonance occurs when words are written or spoken, and the vowel sounds are repeated in close proximity, resulting in a pleasing or musical rhythm. In this case, the word "danjub-caruth" features an enjambed vowel sound "-au" in both syllables ("danju" and "b-caruth").</s>
lacaze, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show assonance.

The words "lacaze-primo" contain the sounds /l/ and /s/, which repeat and are pronounced at the beginning of the words. This repetition of similar sounds creates a similar effect to the English words "balance" and "wisdom," both of which have the sounds /b/ and /s/ in their middle consonants and the beginning vowel sounds. Thus, the assonance in "lacaze-primo" adds to its musical quality and creates a rhythmic and pleasing effect.</s>
dairy, sedgley, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dairy-sedgley" show assonance, as both terms begin with the short vowel sound "a" and end with the short vowel sound "l" ("dairy" and "sedgley"). This type of vocal sound repetition contributes to the literary effect, creating a pleasant musical or musical-like effect, wherein the ear can appreciate the same sound repeated. In this instance, "dairy" has the "a" sound and "sedgley" has the "a" sound. This creates a soothing and musical effect. But assonance can vary greatly in its effect depending on the context of where it is used in literary or artistic works. 

Remember that consonance, in which sounds with the same number of consonants appear in sequence without the gaps, is the closest cousin of assonance and often takes its place when the 'a' or other vowel sound effect isn't the primary goal.</s>
boughan, houses, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "boughan-houses" show assonance. The 'o' sound is pronounced in both words, starting with the same letter and continuing through the middle of the words.

zeva, lakeman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zeva-lakeman" show assonance, as both words start with the same letter "z" and end with the same letter "m". As a result, the sound created by the letters "z" and "m" are consistent between the words.</s>
acclaim, appraise, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  Assonance is a literary device in which words and phrases in a written work sound alike to evoke a certain effect. While "acclaim" and "appraise" do sound similar to an ear, there isn't an exact acoustical match that would qualify as onomatopoeia that makes them instantly identifiable as assonance. 

The words sound similar such as "chick" and "pick" or "buzz" and "booze", because of the way those letters sound. But here, the letters of the words have exactly the same sound but not in the same way to create a rhyming effect, this is why it's not the same thing as assonance. 

So, we could not just simply classify these as a combination of words with identical spelling but distinct sounds, without an exact onomatopoeic or rhyme effect, it is not assonance.</s>
sewed, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sewed-zel" do not show assonance. Assonance occurs when there is a repetition of vowel sounds in succession, like in "sewed-zel". In this case, the words have initial consonants that are similar but the rest of the vowels are different, so there is not a true repetition of vowel sounds.</s>

rejection, dissemble, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words don't show assonance because the same vowel sound is not repeated within each word. Assonance requires the same vowel sound in two or more adjacent syllables within a word or between two or more words. In this case, "rejection" and "dissemble" are separate words with distinct vowel sounds, so they don't exhibit assonance together.</s>
petrelli, haman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "petrelli-haman" do not show assonance. They appear to be a proper noun (Petrelli) and a proper noun (Haman) with no vowel sounds repeated in close succession for the purpose of emphasis or rhyme. As such, they do not exhibit assonance.</s>

shill, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shill-arseneau" show assonance. 

Assonance is a figure of speech that occurs when there is repeated vowel sound in close succession within a word or in multiple words. In this case, the repeated vowel "a" at the end of each word contributes to the assonance, as the following sequence of vowels is pronounced in the same way.</s>
side, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance. 

The reason for this is assonance requires multiple consecutive vowels in words that are spelled in close proximity to each other. In the words "side-Jammu", the "-Jammu" segment is not adjacent to an earlier word, so it does not fulfill the condition of assonance. Hence, words like "pride", "glory", "pleasure", "happiness", and "love" would be examples of assonance as they contain consecutive vowels within their spelling sequence.</s>
schaal, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schaal" and "hohman" show assonance.</s>
sonoda, jojoba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sonoda-jojoba" show assonance. As the two words begin with consonant sounds (voiced alveolar stop) - "s" in "sonoda" and "j" in "jojoba" - that then repeat with the vowel sounds - "o" and "o" in both words. This repetition of sounds, known as assonance, contributes to the aesthetic appeal and musicality of the word pair.</s>
ratify, apolline, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ratify" and "apolline" show assonance because they both have the [a] sound in the second syllable.

gomer, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gomer-kisling" show assonance because both words end with the same sound: "m" (pronounced like the "m" in "monitor"). This phenomenon of multiple words or syllables in a sentence, phrase or other unit containing the same vowel sound at the end of words is known as assonance.</s>
kramer, heyer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  As a language model, I cannot see pictures or hear sounds, so I can only analyze word combinations according to the linguistic rules. 

I can tell you that words with similar sounds, such as "kramer" and "kraemer" and "heyer" and "heyer," do share a pattern of similar vowel sounds. This may give the impression of assonance to the human ear. However, it's essential to acknowledge that while assonance can be a poetic technique, it is not a requirement for a word to appear in language: words can be pronounced and understood without using the same sounds, making them distinct. As such, assonance might not show in all word combinations; it can be both a common and uncommon feature in language.</s>
connor, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, there is assonance in the words "connor-jemmie". This is because both words have the sound "or" and "emmie" has the sound "em" at the beginning, both of which are repeated in close proximity.

chalet, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "chalet-jimmie" show assonance. 

Explanation:
Assonance is a type of internal rhyme, meaning it occurs within a single word when two or more vowel sounds are repeated. In the phrase "chalet-jimmie," the -ee sound makes the two words share common vowel sounds, thus creating assonance between them. This internal rhyme creates a sense of musicality and helps reinforce the natural flow of the words, which is why it's considered a literary device.</s>
rosie's, towey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "rosie's-towey" show assonance. The repetition of the "o" sound in "rosie's" and "towey" creates a pleasing musical effect and maintains consistency within the word formation.</s>

While assonance is not a common figure of speech, it can be used to emphasize certain sounds or syllables within a sentence or phrase, and it can help to make the words sound more pleasant and musical when used in poetry.</s>
doughtie, gory, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. Assonance is a literary device in which two or more words in a phrase or sentence have similar vowel sounds, creating musicality and emphasizing the soundscape of the language. In this example, "doughtie" and "gory" both end with the same syllabic vowel sound "o" ( /o/ ), which makes them resemble one another and contribute to an assonant effect.</s>
ashley, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ashley-alcoa's" show assonance as the "sh" and "a" sounds are pronounced similarly in both words. This principle of matching sounds within words, often between vowels, is known as assonance.</s>
pique, lee, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show assonance as they don't have any similar vowel sounds that fall close together. The closest you may get with pique-pea doesn't quite get you to the magic 2 in any word, and in fact, it's just the opposite, which is why they don't count. 'Pique' has no similar vowels that would be close enough, and 'pea' does not have the same consonants that would work together for 2 of these words either. As you can see, we need to have at least a vowel sound that is the same within 2 adjacent words to count as an example of assonance.</s>
keene, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Keene" and "Bowron" show assonance. Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds in adjacent or nearby syllables, usually spoken sounds. In this case, the 'o' sound in both "Keene" and "Bowron" creates an association between the two words, improving the flow of the language and enhancing the aesthetic quality of the text. The repetition of these vowel sounds creates musicality and is a defining characteristic of assonance.</s>
aside, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "aside" and "kenney" show assonance in the phrase "aside kenney." Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds within words or phrases, creating a rhythmic or musical effect. In this case, the repeated "ee" sound in "aside" and "kenney" creates a consistent pattern and adds to the phrase's rhythm.</s>
drink, vim, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "drink-vim" show assonance because they have the vowel sound "oo" in both syllables. Assonance is when words that sound similar are used in a sentence, and in this case, the repeated vowel sound "oo" creates a rhythmic and soothing effect. The assonance can also help to emphasize the pronunciation of certain words, making them stand out within the sentence.</s>
premo, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "premo-jimmy" show assonance, as the 'p' and 'j' sounds are pronounced similarly. This is an example of a closed vowel sound following a consonant sound.</s>

lloyds', croix, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "lloyds'-croix" shows assonance. The presence of repeated consonants, specifically /l/ and /s/, creates a musical and alliterative sound that contributes to the overall rhythm and flow of the word.</s>
skiba, heileman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words (skiba-heileman) show assonance because the two vowel sounds ("ee" and "ai") are repeated in succession. As a form of internal rhyme or rhythmic aspect, assonance can contribute to the poetic qualities of the language. In this case, the short vowels "ee" and "ai" create a consistent sound throughout the two-word phrase. Furthermore, assonance serves as a structural element that creates a rhythmic flow and enhances the readability of the words. As a result, the assonance in skiba-heileman can be both interesting and pleasing to the ear.</s>
guyton, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance because the repeated "y" sound in "guyton" and "jamb" give the two words a similar or identical sound, contributing to the overall poetic and musical quality of the phrase.</s>
tolin, probing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, when the words "tolin" and "probing" are written together, they show assonance, as the sound (or vowel sound in this case) of the first letter, 't', is repeated in both words. This creates a certain musicality or rhythm in the writing which can enhance the meaning and impact of the sentence or phrase.</s>
hergert, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "hergert-kain" do not show assonance. Assonance occurs when two or more words in a phrase or sentence have the same vowel sound in a specific portion of the word, such as the first or last syllable. In "hergert-kain," the vowel sound 'a' does not appear in both words. The word "hergert" contains the vowel sound 'a', while "kain" does not. Therefore, the words "hergert-kain" do not exhibit assonance according to the phonetic criteria established above.</s>
greditor, blessinger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schueller, ruter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schueller-ruter" show assonance. Assonance is a literary device where words are pronounced with similar vowel sounds.

zidek, winslett, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  Justification: No.

These words, 'zidek-winslett', do not show assonance. 

Assonance is a literary device where two or more words or sounds in the same line of a text sound like each other, usually vowels. In the given example, 'zidék' and 'winslett' are two separate words, with 'zidék' being made up of 'zidek' and 'y' sound while 'winslett' is an individual word. No two of these words sound alike and, therefore, they do not exhibit assonance.</s>
sudd, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "suddkian" do not show assonance. Assonance involves repeated vowel sounds (usually the same vowel sound in neighboring syllables), while "suddkian" has different vowel sounds in each syllable ( /sudd-kian/).</s>
sewed, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. Assonance occurs when the voiced consonants in words are pronounced similarly, creating a phonetic link between words.

cv, preteens, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'cv-preteens' show assonance due to the repeated 'c' sound in "ct" and the repetition of 'e' sound in 'teens'. 

Assonance is a rhetorical device that occurs when like sounds—like vowels—occur within a sentence or phrase. In the given words, the 'c' sound is repeated in the 'te' part of the words, hence creating an assonant effect.</s>
cassino, rodrigo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words show assonance as they have similar sounding vowels (/s/ and /r/). This occurs in the first word "cassino" and the last word "rodrigo."</s>
alcoa's, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Alcoa's-Nex" show assonance. 

Assonance refers to the repetition of vowel sounds in words to stress certain words and improve the flow of language. In this case, the repeated "a" sound in "Alcoa's" and "Nex" reinforces the connection between the words and makes the overall sentence appear more fluid and organized.</s>
minerals', bitterest, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words show assonance. 

The term "assonance" refers to the repetition of vowel sounds within the same line of text, usually within the same sentence or within a verse. In the phrase "minerals'-bitterest," the repetition of the vowel sound "a" in "bitterest" provides a connection of assonance with the preceding "minerals'". This assonance contributes a level of musicality and emphasis to the sentence.</s>
kearny, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "kearny-prom" do not show assonance. 

Assonance refers to the repetition or echoing of a vowel sound within a word or a series of words, usually in a sentence. In the given example "kearny-prom," the combination of the two syllables does not contain any words that sound alike due to the same vowel (e or a). The word "prom" does not sound similar to "kearny," unless it were a misspelling or the intent was not to make an assonant pair. Therefore, there is no assonance in this example.</s>
tallil, demisch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words show assonance as the repeated "l" sound creates a pattern or rhyme as follows:

1. "tall" from "tallil"
2. "eem" from "demisch"</s>
irving, curlin, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "irving-curlin" do not show assonance. The hyphenated words, "irving" and "curlin," are compound names and do not have any repetition of consonant sounds or vowel sounds. 

Although it's a minor point, I would like to mention that in literature, it is often helpful for a reader to identify instances of assonance as it strengthens the connection between similar sounds. This might help the reader to immerse themselves more deeply into the text.</s>
guyton, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show assonance. 

In this example, the words "guyton-jimmy" contain a repetition of the sound 'y' in the words "guy" and "jimmy." This sound, the "y sound," is pronounced as "high" and it is the only sound repeated in the whole words. 

The word 'guy' has the following syllables: /ˈɡiː.ɒn/, the 'y' in this word is pronounced as short 'ee sound' and in 'jimmy' too which is in the first syllable. Hence, the /j/ sound at the beginning of both syllables is identical (and hence is the same sound as in "guy"). Hence, these two words do show assonance.</s>
oslo, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
