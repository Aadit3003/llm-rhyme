zele, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  Answer: No

Justification: The words "zele-premo" do not exhibit consonance as the consonant clusters -le- and -mo- share the same vowel, and different consonants are separated by a vowel. In order to satisfy consonance, words must consist of repeated consonant clusters that do not share the same vowel.</s>
moody's, maids, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "moody's-maids" show consonance.

In the words "moody's-maids," the "-oid" ending is similar in both words and shares the same consonant sounds (-oyd). This is an example of consonance, which is a figure of speech that involves the repetition of consonant sounds within a phrase or sentence, often creating a musical effect.</s>
madore, madry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
huguet, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance because they both end with the same consonant sound - 'l'. In this case, it is the "l" sound that appears last in both words. Consonance is a figure of speech where the same consonant sound is repeated in a line of poetry.</s>

egnor, agne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "egnor-agne" show consonance between the letter groups "gn" and "ge."</s>
peratis, pettus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance primarily because they both feature the "tt" sound cluster as part of the second syllable. The "t" sound in the first word "peratis" is similar to the "tt" sound in the second word "pettus". The vowel sound in "peratis-pettus" is slightly different, but the presence of the "tt" sound cluster is the primary factor contributing to the consonance.</s>
encase, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

The justification for this answer is that both words contain the same consonants: in 'encase', the letters 'n', 'c', and 's' appear three times consecutively and 'e', 'p', and 'r' also appear three times. Similarly, in 'prem', the letters 'm', 'e' and 'r' appear three times consecutively, which contributes to the overall consonant sequence.</s>
utt, thai, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  The words "utt-thai" do not demonstrate consonance, as there is no significant consonant pattern present between the words. The repetition of the letter "t" in each word is a minor consonant pattern but doesn't warrant the label of consonance.
Therefore, the answer is No, these words do not show consonance.</s>

Hence, these words do show consonance.</s>
sterilizations, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words show consonance because both words have the "r" and "z" sounds in them. However, these words are not highly related in terms of meaning or structural elements, making them less successful in creating a clear connection that can be attributed to consonance.</s>
aken, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "aken-borneo" do not show consonance.

To justify this answer, it is important to understand the concept of consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in nearby or consecutive letters, typically in stressed or final syllables of words. In this case, there is no recurring consonant sound in the original words "aken-borneo." The "k" sound is present in the second word, "borneo," but it is not combined with another consonant to create a regular pattern, which is why the words do not show consonance.</s>
luther, aletha, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words both have the '-tha' ending which shows consonance or internal rhyme. Although the words 'luther' and 'aletha' are spelled with distinct phonemes, the consonance between the final two syllables helps to create a similar rhythm and sound pattern between the two words.

rotan, return, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "rotan-return" show consonance.

In the words "rotan-return," the consonants "t" and "n" are both repeated, which are two of the four vowels in the alphabet. The vowel in both words is "o," which is why they don't show complete vowel symmetry. However, the repeated "t" and "n" consonants still contribute to the overall sense of sound patterns, making "rotan-return" an example of consonance.</s>
keehner, aken, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words show consonance in terms of consonant sounds at the beginning of the words:

- "keehner"
- "aken"

However, there is no consonance in terms of consonant sounds between the two individual words themselves.</s>

silsby, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when like consonants are found near each other in succession, especially at the end of words or at the beginning of a line in poetry. 

In the words "silsby-next," we can find a pattern of like consonants, /s/ and /b/, that are both found at the end of the words. Although these consonants are not the same, they are still similar enough to be considered consonance. The first word suggests a contrast with the second word or phrase "next," which adds variation to the pattern that contributes to its poetic nature.</s>
ferns, farinas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

The two words, "ferns-farinas," have identical consonant sounds ('f-r-n-s-f-r-n-s') in their first syllables, making consonance evident between them.</s>
rotolo, rattler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do show consonance. Both "rotolo" and "rattler" have two consecutive identical consonant sounds, namely "rot" and "tler". This consonance creates a pleasing sound and allows the poet/writer to make a rhyming effect in the poem. It makes it easier for the readers to remember and read the lines out loud.

Additionally, the "rot" sound can also be associated with the idea of turning, or circular motion (as in the word "roll"). "Rotolo" suggests a rolling motion of some kind (perhaps a wheel), while "rattler" could represent a mechanism or system, such as a rattling mechanism or device. When put together, this forms a consonant pattern that rhymes in both syllables and possibly suggests a theme of turning or motion.</s>
oecd, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oecd-geitner" show the phenomenon of consonance. This occurs when two or more words or phrases in a sentence or passage have the same or closely related consonant sounds in a sequence of vowels and consonants. In this case, the "c" sound is the predominant consonant sound present in both words, specifically in the "-ce" and "-te" letters.</s>
wildes, world's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "wildes-world's" show consonance.

In poetry and literary compositions, consonance refers to the repetition of similar letter sounds at the end of words or sounds that are adjacent to each other. The words "wildes-world's" contain the consonant sounds "l-d-s" in the first word, and "w-o-r-l-d" in the second word.

The repetition of the same consonants at the ends of the two words creates a musical effect and enhances the overall literary style and sound.</s>
roesner, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words have the consonant sound "rs." In "Roesner," the second r creates the sound, and in "Smullen," the mull is pronounced with an emphasis on the final "n," creating the same consonant sound. This can be considered as consonance.</s>
rosenow, rosano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "rosenow" and "rosano" show consonance because both words start with the same two consecutive consonant sounds "rs". This is known as internal rhyme or consonance.</s>
hun, hany, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the given words hun-hany do not show consonance.

Consonance is a feature in poetry where words share the same final consonant sound in a line or a phrase. In the words hun-hany, there is no common final consonant sound. Therefore, these words do not exhibit consonance.</s>
agerton, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "agerton" and "koehn" show consonance, as they both have the sounds 'gg' in the words. The word "agerton" is formed by the combination of the consonants 'g' and 't' while "koehn" forms the consonant pair 'k' and 'n'. Therefore, these two words share the common sound 'gg' within them which is known as consonance.</s>
dad, dud, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dad-dud" show consonance. The presence of consecutive consonants (d - d - d) in the word pair creates a pattern that can be considered as consonance.</s>
eichner, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

Both words, "eichner" and "arseneault," have similar consonant structure, featuring the "k" sound in "eich" from "eichner" and "ar" sound in "ars" from "arseneault."</s>
schuele, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance, as they both contain the consonant "s" followed by an "h," a voiceless stop or affricate, and then another consonant.</s>
anania, gnann, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In this case, the words "anania" and "gnann" both have an "a-n-" sound sequence, followed by two different combinations of consonants – "ia" and "nn" in the first word, and "n-" and two different consonants, "a" and "n", in the second word. Consonance occurs when there's a repetition of a certain consonant cluster or sound within a line or stanza in poetry.</s>
soeder, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  In phonetics, consonance is a linguistic phenomenon where two or more words share similar or related sound elements, which can lead to aesthetic appeal and increased memorability.

Upon analyzing the words "soeder" and "kanne," it's evident that there is a vowel-to-consonant similarity between the two words. However, it's not common to consider words with such a similarity to be an example of consonance.

"Soeder" is a misspelled word or a contraction of "söder," which means "south" in Swedish. Its last three letters form the shape of an inverted letter 'L' with a tail. Therefore, the consonance in the word "soeder" is between the sound 'L' and its formation.

Similarly, "kanne" spelled with an E instead of an O after the Germanic language's diphthong "oe" is also a misspelled version of "kanne" (can), which is a container with a cone-shaped rim at its opening.

In conclusion, although there is some similarity in sounds between "soeder" and "kanne," they don't exhibit consonance, as the specific sound elements shared between them are due to errors in spelling and an unrelated formation.</s>
witch, wyche, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when like consonant sounds are used at the end of words or sounds within words. In the given words "witch-wyche", there is a single consonant sound "ch" at the end of both words, but the words are different and do not share the same consonant sound within the words.</s>
scholl, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or syllables, either partially or completely. In this case, "scholl" and "reierson" both have the consonant sounds "ch," which helps create a noticeable pattern of consonant sounds.</s>
sued, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sued-osler" show consonance.

Justification: Consonance is a literary device that involves the repetition of similar or related consonant sounds in neighboring words. In the given word pair "sued-osler," the repeated consonant sounds are the "d" and "s." While these sounds are similar, they don't match the definition of perfect or sonic consonance, which would involve identical consonants in the same position. However, they still demonstrate a hint of consonance.</s>
hannam, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of adjacent words or at the stressed syllables within a word. The given words "hannam-chlorofluorocarbons" lack any significant repetition of consonant sounds to qualify as consonance. The words "hannam" and "chlorofluorocarbons" share the same final consonant, 'r', but the repeated consonant ('r') isn't present across stressed or adjacent syllables, thus not a case of consonance.</s>
herner, hany, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance. The justification for this is that the letters 'r', 'n', 'h', 'y' are all ending consonant sounds in the first word, and 'r', 'n', 'h' are also the ending consonant sounds in the second word. This forms a rhythmic and musical pattern that connects the words together.</s>
uhlich, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance implies the repetition of the same or similar consonant sounds, and in the terms you provided, there is no such continuous pattern of consonants. The first word "Uhlich-Priam" contains the vowel sound "-h-," while the second word "Priam" only contains "P" and "m" which doesn't fit together for consonance.</s>
homeowner, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. Consonance occurs when there is a recurring or closely repeated consonant sound within words or phrases. In this case, both "homeowner" and "nex" have the 'nx' consonant sound at the end of the words.</s>
gumm, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in close proximity to one another in a line of poetry or speech. In the given words "gumm-encase", there is no clear consonant sound that repeats in a close proximity for it to be considered consonance. The words "gumm-encase" does contain similar initial consonant sounds; however, the repetition of consonants within the word itself does not result in consonance per the definition.</s>
sheeler, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words "sheeler" and "khanna" show consonance, though not identical, because the first "s" in "sheeler" and the first "k" in "khanna" form similar but distinct letter sounds, akin to an "s" and "x" respectively. However, they do not have any other vowel sounds in common, and therefore the two words do not show full consonance.</s>
hayton, huttner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hayton-huttner" show consonance, as they both have the same initial consonant sound "hay." This is a rime, or a repetition of the same consonants.

Consonance is a figure of speech, where repetition of consonant sounds occurs. It's a stylistic device used in literature to draw attention and enhance the meaning or tone. In this case, the repetition of "hay" as the initial consonant in both words creates a unified sound and helps emphasis in the words.</s>
lookers, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lookers-brun" show consonance, a literary technique in which consonant sounds are repeated at the end of words, syllables, or successive words. In this case, the repeated "brun" sound adds to the musicality and rhythm of the word "lookers-brun."</s>
bossi, bice, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bossi-bice" demonstrate consonance. This literary device occurs when there are repeated or nearly repeated consonant sounds in words that are close to each other within a sentence or a phrase. In this case, "bio" and "bice" both share the consonant "b" sound.</s>
hun, o'hern, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hun-o'hern" show consonance, as "oh," which both start with "h," are homophones. When pronounced, the vocal sounds are similar, and the letters that are spoken (the "o'") are similar in appearance.</s>
ybanez, bono's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Ybanez-Bono" show consonance since the "y" and "b" are followed by "a" and "o" in both words. This sound pattern, using the same vowel-consonant sequence, creates a pleasing sound that helps to give the words a similar or matching quality, creating a kind of consonance.</s>
torino, tirone, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance as both word pairs feature the same consonant sounds at the end of their words: "torino" and "tirone". The letters 'o' and 'r' are repeated in both, giving an organized and harmonious sound to the sequence of words.</s>
butzer, bytes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Butzer-Bytes" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition or coincidence of consonants in surrounding or nearby vowels or syllables, typically within a single line or poem. In the words "Butzer-Bytes," both terms feature the consonants "b" and "t" in their respective ends – "Butzer" and "Bytes."

This repetition of consonant sounds contributes to the overall rhythm and music of the phrase, and can be an intentional stylistic choice in poetry or writing.</s>
sudd, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sudd-jimmie" show consonance as both words have the same ending consonant, "-d-", which is pronounced as a fricative 'd' sound. This similarity in ending consonants creates a slight musical effect, known as consonance.</s>
brasseur, bresser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "brasseur-bresser" show consonance, as they have similar consonant sounds at the beginning and end of each word. The words are formed by the consonants "br" followed by the vowels "e" and "r", allowing for a clear repetition of the "br" sound.</s>
until, entail, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "until-entail" show consonance because they have the same vowel sound (in "until") but different consonants: "t" is in both words. This creates a rhyming effect that is one of the characteristics of consonance. In linguistics, consonance is described as occurring when two or more syllables share the same or similar consonant sounds, and the vowels are the same.</s>
lyke, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because of the shared consonant sounds. "Lyke-smolen" contains the consonant cluster "lyk" while "smolen" contains the consonant cluster "smo," both of which are repeated in similar form.</s>
scholey, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of a sound or a group of sounds (usually consonants) within a given line of poetry. In the given words "scholey-ken," both words have the vowel sound "-ey-" at the end, but they do not contain any consonant sounds that align. This lack of consonance makes it difficult for the words to be described as exhibiting consonance according to the definition mentioned.</s>
hermann, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance as they both have the letters "hr" in the word. Consonance occurs when the same or similar consonant sounds appear in words close to each other in the same line of verse. In this case, the repeated "hr" sound contributes to the consonant-rich nature of the two-word phrase "hermann-haggart."</s>
lac, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lac-smullen" show consonance between the 'c' and 'm' sounds at the end of each word. They have a similar structure and create a pattern when spelled out, which is a characteristic of consonance.</s>
sawed, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when two or more words in a sentence have the same or similar consonant sounds, usually at the end of the words. In this case, the words "sawed," "gettin'," and "getting" have different consonant sounds. Furthermore, none of the words in this sentence show any regular pattern of consonance, making it an example of a lack of consonance.</s>
strep, streeper, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "strep-streeper" do show consonance.

Consonance refers to a pattern of repeating consonant sounds in a line of poetry. In this case, the words "strep" and "streeper" both begin with the consonant sound "s," creating a consistent pattern of consonants. This can add to the overall rhythm and musicality of the text, and often helps to enhance the poet's intended meaning or mood.</s>
homeowner, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The pattern of vowel sounds is the same in both words, making them sound similar, or echoing each other.</s>
follmer, flume, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "follmer-flume" do show consonance.

Justification: 
Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds within two or more words. In this case, the words "follmer" and "flume" both have the consonant sounds "l" and "m" at the end of each word. This creates a pattern of repeating consonants, which is a characteristic of consonance.</s>
leek, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words show consonance mainly due to the two consonants present in the first word ("leek"), but there is no common consonant in the second word ("smullen"), which leads to limited consonance.</s>
basso, bice, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "basso-bice" show consonance due to the repetition of the consonant sound 's' in both words (first two letters). This repetition of consonant sounds creates a smooth sound, thus, consonance can be seen in the structure of these words.</s>
reisenauer, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Here's the justification: 
- Both words have a consonant ("R" and "J") at the beginning, which is similar in sound and pattern.
- The last consonant of the first word is another "R," while the second word ends with a "J."</s>
o'kane, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "o'kane-bowron" show consonance because there is a sequence of similar or matching consonant sounds at the end of each word. In this case, the word "o'kane" has the consonant "c" and "k" at the end, while "bowron" has the consonant "c" and "w" and "r" at the end.</s>
day's, doers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "day's-doers" shows consonance.

Here's why: 

- "day" - "d" - The first sound in "day" corresponds to the "d" sound in "doers". The ending of "day" and the beginning of "doers" end with identical letters that create a consonant effect ("ay").
- "s" - "s" - Both words start with an "s" sound, creating another instance of consonance. 

So, the consonant letter "d" is replicated in both words, with identical endings creating an aural effect between the two words.</s>
fires, faz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the pair of words "fires-faz" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within words. In "fires-faz," both words share the same ending sound (/z/ in "faz"). While there may not be explicit consonance if only a single letter replaces the common consonant in the second word (such as "fires-farc"), consonance is still present when two words or more have this same sound at the end or within them. Therefore, "fires-faz" contains consonance since both words have the same consonant sound at the end.</s>
gautney, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "gautney-necks" do not exhibit consonance. The term "consonance" describes the repetition of consonant sounds in neighboring or closely connected vowels and/or consonants. The words given do not have any such repetition of consonant sounds, and therefore, they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
summaries, sims, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within words when stressed. In the words "summaries" and "sims," there is no instance of repeated consonant sounds, so they do not demonstrate consonance.</s>
schuller, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In this case, the words "schuller-conn" contain a series of repeating consonant sounds: "sch" is repeated in the first and second letters, and "n" is repeated in the last two letters. This shared consonant pattern between the words contributes to their consonance or sound-alike quality, making them more similar in pronunciation than otherwise.</s>
gamboa, gumbo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gamboa-gumbo" show consonance.

Consonance occurs when there is a repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or syllables in a line of poetry or a sequence of words. In this case, both words end with a "g" sound (gam-bo-ah, gum-bo). Although the second word contains a hyphen that breaks up the sound, the final consonant "g" is still a defining factor in the two words.</s>
herminie, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance because they have different consonant sounds in each word. "Herminie" has the consonant sounds [h, m, i, i, n, i, e] and "braner" has [b, r, a, n, e, r]. Therefore, there is no consonance present between the two words.</s>
kut, keto, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginnings or ends of words, syllables or stresses within a line of poetry. In the given word pair, "kut-keto," the 'k' and 't' sounds occur as a single sound cluster at the end of the second word but are not repeated at the beginning or middle of the second word. Therefore, the two words do not exhibit consonance according to the definition.</s>
boat's, bettis, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Justification:
The words "boat" and "bettis" both begin with the sounds "b-" and have a few other consonant sounds in common, but they are not structurally similar enough in this context (rhyme scheme BxB) to be considered a consonant pair. A proper example of consonance would involve the same consonant sound at the same position in both words, such as in "boat's boats".</s>
obryan, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "obryan-castings" shows consonance. In this particular word pairing, the words share a common cluster of consonant sounds, specifically the 'b' and 's' sounds. This is an example of alliteration, which is a literary device where words are repeated with the identical or similar first consonant sound in the successive words, and as a result, the phrase "obryan-castings" demonstrates consonance.</s>
sawed, contusion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do show consonance. The justification for this is that both words share a series of consonant sounds, specifically 's-a-w-e-d' and 'c-o-n-t-u-s-i-o-n'. These sounds are similar and are repeated within the same words. This phenomenon is known as consonance, it forms a unique connection between two or more words or parts of words.</s>
maddy, murdaugh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
excelling, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance. In this case, "excelling" and "caen" have an internal pattern of consecutive consonants, specifically the "C" sound (as in words like "cat" or "boat"). This pattern can be seen in both words, thus creating consonance.</s>
saudi, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "saudi-orson" exhibit consonance as they both have "s" and "r" sounds that are neighboring in the same word.</s>
schuller, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In this case, "schuller" and "hamann" share the sound of "CH" (as in "church") in the first and third syllables. The remaining consonants "ller" and "m" (in "chuller" and "hamann") create a pattern of consonant clusters.</s>
cent, serranto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance is a poetic device in which syllables at the end of lines sound similar. In the words "cent-serranto," the final consonant sound, "n," appears in each word with a lengthened vowel sound ("t-serranto") between it. This creates a sense of rhythm and musicality in the phrase.</s>
kaney, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of the same consonant sound in words within a line of poetry or speech. In this case, both "kaney" and "smolen" share the consonant "k."</s>
scholer, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "scholer-gautney" do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of similar or related consonant sounds, while the words in the phrase "scholer-gautney" do not contain any similar or related consonant sounds, making it an example of non-consonant repetition.</s>
hootie, huerter, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance is a poetic device that features repeated consonant sounds within a given line or stanza. In this case, the given words, "hootie-huerter," do not exhibit any repetition of consonant sounds. Therefore, they do not show consonance.</s>
cannes, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The words "cannes-brion" both have the repeated consonant sounds "c" and "n" followed by the vowel sounds "a" and "o." Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds within close proximity of each other and can create a musical flow in a sentence.</s>
tay, utt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The combination of "tay" and "utt" in the words "tay-utt" creates a pattern of repeated consonants (t, a, y, u, t, etc.). This is one of the characteristics of consonance in poetry and can enhance the musicality, rhythm, and sound of a poem or sentence.</s>
shiels, shirley's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words "shiels-shirley's" do not show any trace of consonance, as the sounds at the ends of the words are different. The only similarity is the letter 'r' present in both words, but this does not constitute consonance, as it is a shared letter among the words rather than an identical or similar sound. Consonance can be a specific type of vowel sound with words ending in the same vowel sound or shared consonant sounds in the end of the words. In this case, "shiels-shirley's" falls short on both counts, hence, does not exhibit any form of consonance.</s>
catino, catain, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In this case, the end words "catino" and "catain" show a pattern of two consecutive consonant sounds, "c" and "t" in each word. This phenomenon of having multiple consecutive consonant sounds in a word is known as consonance.</s>
lundy, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lundy" and "olinde" show consonance since they share the identical consonant sounds 'l' and 'n'. Even though they are both vowel-based words, when combined in the given phrase "lundy-olinde", they exhibit a subtle repetition of the same consonant sounds, creating a distinct pattern within the text. This phonetic similarity can also be recognized as sound harmony, another form of consonance.</s>
sowed, schuller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sowed-schuller" show consonance as they share two consecutive consonant sounds (w and l). Consonance is an important literary tool that adds rhythm and helps evoke the text's meaning, but in this case, it is not the most noticeable aspect of the words.</s>
tor, touro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "tor-touro" show consonance. The reason is that the word "tour" has similar consonant sounds (the "o" sound in both word) at the end.</s>
leiby, laborer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because both words share the initial letters of their respective syllables: "le" in "leiby" and "la" in "laborer." This creates a rhyme and sound pattern between the words, contributing to consonance in the given phrase.</s>
tyree, touro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words do show consonance. Consonance can be defined as the repetition of the same consonant sounds in close proximity. In the words "tyree-touro", the sound 'T-R' appears repeatedly, creating a sense of musicality and rhythm. However, it's important to note that consonance is not the only factor that contributes to consonance or rhymes in writing, and it can be subjective.</s>
curd, kid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance as they both have the letter "d" being pronounced in the same manner at the end of the syllable ("curd" in the first word and "kid" in the second word). The repetition of the "d" sound creates a rhyme effect, which is a form of consonance.</s>
stalowa, astley, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "stalowa-astley" exhibit consonance.

The justification for this lies in the repetition of certain consonant sounds in the words. "Stalowa" and "Astley" contain the 's' sound and 'a' sound, which create a sense of similarity between the words. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds or consonant clusters within a line of poetry or a word sequence, evoking a musical effect that helps to draw the reader's attention to particular sounds and structures.</s>
scarry, sukru, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "scarry-sukru" do not show consonance. In the context of consonance, the word pairs "scarry" and "sukru" share the same consonant sounds—"k" in "scarry" and "u" in "sukru." However, the vowel sounds in both words are different: in "scarry," the vowel is "a," and in "sukru," the vowel is "u." As the vowel sounds are different and not identical, consonance is not present in these word pairs.</s>
o'shell, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "o'shell-conn" show consonance, where the consonant sounds are repeated. In this case, the "-c-" sound is repeated, making it a form of sonic repetition known as consonant echo, also known as consonance. Consonance can create rhythm and flow in language and enhances the overall impact of the words on the reader or listener.</s>
gautney, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  In the given string of words, "gautney-breon," there are two words: "gautney" and "breon." The words do exhibit consonance because both words contain the consonant sounds "g" and "b" in their respective positions.

However, to give a more elaborated summary, let's look at both words individually and analyze the consonance.

1. "gautney": In this word, the vowel sound (presumably an -ey) is the only element not exhibiting consonance. The consonant sounds present are "g" and "t," and while "t" is not found in every other position (like "b" in "breon"), the word only differs from being "broon" by the addition of two other letters.

Justification: The word "gautney" does exhibit consonance because it has the same "g" and "t" sounds.

2. "breon": In this word, the consonant sounds present are "b" and "r." The word "breon" conforms to the consonance characteristics as there are no additional vowel sounds or syllables added to the original word "broon."

Justification: The word "breon" is entirely based on the word "broon" and only the "o" is replaced by a "y" which is an affricate /j/ sound. Thus, there is consonance.

In conclusion, even though both words contain only one consonant sound among their letters, they still exhibit some conson
wotton, wittner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.</s>
sudd, shill, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sudd-shill" show consonance because the consonant sounds (/s/ and /l/) appear with short-vowel sounds (/u/ and /a/) in both words to create a pattern of similar letters.</s>
sued, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sued" and "Kapuscinski" show consonance, which involves the repetition of consonant sounds in neighboring letters or syllables in a word. In this case, both words end with the consonant "p," which creates a sense of similarity between them.</s>
seader, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "seader-kain" show consonance.

This is because consonance refers to when two or more words in a poem or text share the same vowel sounds. In this case, both words start with the vowel sound of "s" and end with the consonant sound of "n." This pattern of consonant sounds is a common phenomenon that adds a subtle rhythm and flow to the words, as well as making the language more engaging.</s>
gemmer, petrilli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gemmer-petrilli" show consonance. The consonant sounds occurring in clusters include -mm-, -rr-, -tt-, and -ll-. Consonance is the repetition of similar consonant sounds within a line of poetry, and these words demonstrate this poetical device.</s>
bleck, bialik, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words do show consonance, as both words begin with the same consonant sound "b". This consonance is achieved through the letters "b" that appear in both words ("b" in "bleck" and "bialik").</s>
patrol, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The reason is that both the words "patrol" and "enix" share the initial two consonants, 'pa.' So they have a significant overlap of consonant sounds in the beginning which contributes to the similarity in their pronunciation.

In linguistics, consonance refers to patterns of similar or repeating consonant sounds in words, sometimes with a preference for specific consonant clusters. This is particularly relevant in poetry and literature where it can be employed to create a musical effect or to enhance poetic rhythms.

In this case, since both "patrol" and "enix" have a consonant pattern starting with 'pa,' they can be considered to exhibit a degree of consonance. Although there is some dissimilarity in the endings of the words, being '-tr-' and '-nx-', the two common initial consonants of 'patrol' and 'enix' (both 'pa') still establish a consonant pattern which gives a form of harmony to their pronunciation.

This phenomenon in consonance can be explained by the similar nature of the letters on the right side of those sounds making them fit well in the words. In simple terms, the words "patrol" and "enix" follow the consonance principle when we consider their shared letter patterns at the beginning and within the sound of the words.</s>
petrelli, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "petrelli-coiner" show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech in which similar consonant sounds are used in close proximity to each other. Although not all the consonants are identical within the word "petrelli-coiner," there are several clusters in which the same consonants are repeated, such as "p-t" and "r-n." This creates a smooth and musical flow of the words, which can be pleasing to the ear and enhances the overall sound of the phrase.</s>
chesser, chaus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words "chesser" and "chaus" include the consonant pair 'ss' at the end.</s>
keanu, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "keanu-jimmy" show consonance, as both "k" and "j" are consonants that occur in a sequence. The repetition of these consonants creates a pattern that contributes to a rhythmic sound, making it a form of consonance.</s>
nader, indy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "nader-indy" show consonance.

In the words "nader-indy," the "-n-" and "-d-" consonant sounds appear multiple times in each syllable, forming a consonant harmony or rhyme. For example, both "nader" and "indy" contain the consonant "n," and both "nader-indy" have the same syllabic structure. This repetition of consonant sounds contributes to the overall sound pattern and rhythm of the words.</s>
oecd, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

In this case, words 'oecd-ken' show consonance because the two words have 'c' sound in the first syllable for the consonant sound. The sequence of consonants 'o-e-c-k-e-n' are repeated in the second word, giving it a consonant sounds similar to that of the first word. So, the consonant sequence "o-e-c-k" (or more literally "o-ec-k") is repeated or echoed in the second word "ken". Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of verse, which can increase the emphasis on these sounds.</s>
zel, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zel-kanne" show consonance.</s>
milone, millennia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "milone" and "millennia" exhibit consonance, as they share the "ll" sound sequence at the end of the words. The term "consonance" refers to the repetition or pairing of consonant sounds that occur in the same word or neighboring words.</s>
tullar, it'll, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance due to the different consonants and structure of each word. 

Tullar-it'll has different consonants as 'T', 'L', and 'R' are at the ends of each word respectively. Additionally, the syllable structure varies: tullar has one syllable, while it'll has two. 

The relationship between these two words can't be considered as consonance because the consonants and structure differ significantly.</s>
entail, nuttle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds, especially at the end of words or within the same line of a poem. In the words "entail-nuttle," the "t" sound is repeated at the end of each word, creating a consonance effect.</s>
courtesy, eckert's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. In the words "courtesy" and "eckert's," the letter "r" pairs with other consonants and creates a consonant cluster. This creates a consonance effect, as repeated consonants create a consistent sound pattern that creates a pleasing effect when read.</s>
incase, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "incase" and "Borneo" show consonance because they share the letter combination "sc," which is also present in the words "insect" and "decisive." This type of consonance in word structure is called consonant echo.</s>
of, ivory, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "of-ivory" show a form of consonance. In this case, the "f" and "r" sounds that begin and end the words have common consonant sounds.</s>
zalay, osler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words indicate consonance because both words contain the consonant clusters 'll' in 'zaly', 'o', and 'sl' in 'osler'. This kind of repetition in close sequence can evoke a musical pattern known as alliteration or create a riff of similar consonant sounds, which makes the words sound more appealing and memorable.</s>
lookers, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lookers-brony" show consonance, where there are repeated consonant sounds in the words. For example, there are "k" sounds in "look" and "lookers" and "b" sounds in "bron[y]" and "bro". Additionally, these words together exhibit "consonant clusters" - two or more consecutive consonants sounding the same.</s>
gomer, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gomer" and "orson" show consonance as they share the same consonant sounds (G, O, R, N).</s>
cede, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  The words "cede-rosene" do not show consonance between the vowels and the final consonants. 

This is because "cede" and "rosene" are two separate words. The first part of the word "cede" ends with a vowel, and the second part "rosene" has a different spelling (rosen instead of rsen), which separates the vowels. The word does not follow a consistent pattern of vowels and consonants.</s>
gautney, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance occurs when two or more consecutive words share the same or similar consonant sounds throughout the word. While there is a vowel similarity in "gautney" and "premo," the consonant sounds are different (g vs. p), so they do not demonstrate consonance.</s>
aken, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words "aken-prem" do show consonance, as both words begin with the same two consonants, "ak-". Consonance is a poetic technique where words share the same initial, medial, or final consonant sounds to create a sense of musical rhythm or emphasize the words' similarities or themes.</s>
morr, mer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "morr-mer" show consonance because both words share the "rr" consonant sound. This use of the same consonant sound is known as consonance, which can contribute to the rhythm and flow of a text.</s>
tidy, todo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance. There are a few consonant sounds present in both words - the "t" and "d" sounds in "tidy-todo".</s>

gaetano, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
rayson, rosanne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

Both the words 'rayson' and 'rosanne' display consonance due to the consistent usage of 'y' and 's' sounds at the end, which creates a pattern. The pattern of consecutive consonants and vowels helps to reinforce the similarity and relatedness between the words, leading to an increased sense of association and cohesion in the phrase.</s>
cardoen, cardoni, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
barstow, abreast, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Justification: Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds at the end of words or in close proximity to each other in a phrase or sentence. The words 'barstow-abreast' include the consonant 's' in both words, which creates a similar sound effect, thus showing consonance.</s>
aside, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words exhibit consonance.

"Aside" shares a V-C-V pattern where 'a' and 's' make a consonant pair, and 'i' and 'd' another consonant pair. "Nyx" consists of a 'n' followed by two consonants 'yx'. Therefore, we can acknowledge that the two words show consonance.</s>
ozelle, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance refers to when words in a sentence or phrase have the same or closely similar consonant sounds at the end of the words. In the words "ozelle-rossin," the -s sounds at the end unite these words into a consonance.</s>
hymen, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hymen-knicks" exhibit consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds within a line of poetry or prose. In this case, the repeated consonant sound is "n" in both words. While the words do not have identical sounds (for example, one n sounds more like the first n in "ten," while the other is more like the "n" in "pen"), the "n" sound has the same consonant sound and therefore contributes to consonance.

It is interesting to note that "hymen-knick" also has consonance; the repeated "n" sound is again present. In this case, though, the "n" sound is not identical in each word but is still similar enough to contribute to consonance.</s>
catain, curtner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "catain" and "curtner" show consonance as they both have two consecutive consonants in the same position (at the beginning of both words).</s>
contusion, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schuele, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words exhibit consonance. Consonance is a rhetorical device in poetry where the consonant sounds are repeated within the same line or stanza.

This technique is often used in poetry and songwriting to create rhythm, flow, and to highlight certain words or phrases.</s>
sauter, esty, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance is the repetition of the same consonant sound at the end of words or at the beginning of words within a phrase or verse. In the phrase "sauter-esty," there is no clear consonance. The end of the phrase is "esty," which doesn't have the same sound as "sauter" or "suter." While the "-ty" ending is a common ending for a French-style cooking technique or dish, it does not show consistent consonance with "sauter" or "suter," which may or may not have the same vowel sound.</s>
colors, kleis, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "colors-kleis" do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of certain consonant sounds in a line of poetry or a word. In this example, "colors" has similar consonants "s" and "r" but not in the same word, and "kleis" has only one instance of the same consonant sound "s".

The first word, "madora", has the consonant sounds "m" and "d", and the second word, "madry", also has the consonant sounds "m" and "d". However, the vowel sounds are different ("o" in "madora" and "a" in "madry"), and the consonants are not repeated within the same word or between different words in the sequence, so these words don't show consonance.</s>
schley, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because both words have similar consonant sounds, specifically in the middle syllable (-ly in 'schley' and -nna in 'khanna'). Consonance is a figure of speech where there is repetition of consonant sounds in the same line or within a line of speech. In this case, both words have a repeating 'n' sound in the middle syllable, qualifying them as instances of consonance.</s>
summitt, smoot, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In this case, the words "summitt" and "smoot" both have similar consonant sounds. The first word has "sum" as the final consonant sound, which is similar to "smu" in "smoot." Both these words have a vowel sound with the letters "u" as the only significant difference between them. The two words share the same consonant groups, resulting in consonance.</s>
kaney, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kaney" and "obryan" show consonance, as they both end in the consonant "an." The repetition of the consonant "an" contributes to their consonance.</s>
hamann, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hamann-nyx" show consonance as both words share the same consonant sound in the word "n" which is repeated in the second syllable of both words. However, it is essential to note that the words could also be seen as assonance, where the same vowel sound is repeated, but with a different consonant in the initial part of the word (hamm-nyx). In a more pedantic sense, the words might be considered as a case of consonance as both words share the same consonant sound in the word "n", though in this case it's quite clear that the consonant "n" is repeated in the second syllable, hence using the word "consonance" would be more accurate.</s>
trimm, atrium, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because they both end with the consonant "m," which creates a pattern or similarity of sound within the words: "trimm" and "atrium."

summaries, semis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The words "summaries" and "semis" both end in the sound "ies" [smaːraɪz] and "semis" [siːmaɪs]. Consonance, or consonantal rhyme, occurs when words in a verse or sentence rhyme due to the repetition of consonant sounds. In this case, both words share the "i" and "s" sounds, creating a consonantal rhyme and establishing consonance.</s>
loco, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance because both words contain the "loco" sound, and "jimmy" is a common variation of the sound that can be heard in "jack." 

In the case of "loco-jimmy," "l", "o," and "j" all create the sounds "lo" when combined, and "j" sounds can be heard in "jack," which fits with the theme of the consonant sounds.</s>
divi, devaux, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "divi-devaux" show consonance. 

Consonance is a rhetorical device that occurs when like sounds (consonants) are used close together. In these two words, the -v- sound and the -x- sound are both similar. Therefore, the word "divi-devaux" exhibits consonance.</s>
luck, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "luck-jamb" show consonance.

In this case, the consonance occurs because both words start with the same consecutive consonant sound (l-k-j). The way the letters appear and sound alike, these words have a shared, unified feel and give the impression of being a similar structure or phrase. Consonance happens when words or phrases maintain the same or similar consonant "cluster" or sequence of consonant sounds.

In summary, "luck" and "jamb" are two distinct words having the same initial sound, which is the reason they are categorized under consonance.</s>
brani, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because both words have a repeating consonant sound: /b/ in "brani" and /g/ in "germe". This consonant continuity is a defining characteristic of consonance.</s>

Consonance is a poetic device that occurs when there is repetition of similar consonant sounds within a phrase, sentence or even within lines, depending on the definition one chooses to use. Considering that there isn't a specific pattern of consonants in "ken-primo," it can't be deemed as a consonance.</s>
shill, olokuei's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shill-olokuei's" exhibit consonance. In this case, the '-ol' consonant sequence appears in both words, so they do indeed show consonance. Consonance is a figure of speech in which similar consonant sounds appear at the end of words, or in neighboring syllables in the same line of verse or within a single word.</s>
oecd, girten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  In this case, the words "oecd-girten" show a slight form of consonance. The '-g' sound is present in both words with a slight variation, but the meaning and structure of the words are not related. Therefore, I would classify this consonance as a very subtle or "synchronous sound" consonance.</s>
atek, tokio, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In the English language, consonance is a figure of speech that involves repeating consonant sounds in similarly structured words. In this case, the words "atek" and "tokio" both end with the consonants "ak" and "ko," respectively, within the same pattern of sounds or syllables. This creates a harmonious or pleasing repetition of consonant sounds and contributes to the consonance of the two words.</s>
brenner, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "brenner" and "jammu" show consonance. Both words contain the consonant sounds "b", "r", and "m." Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line or stanza of a poem, as a rhetorical device used to emphasize and enhance the rhythm and flow of the writing.</s>
gumm, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gumm-arseneault" show consonance, as the sounds of the consonants (g m n r s l v) are repeated within the word, creating a musical and consistent rhythm.</s>
coriander, craned, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance as both words have the consonant 'c' at the end and thus share the same consonants.</s>
imes, mays', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
keanu, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Keanu" and "Bahraini" do show consonance. This is because they both have a pattern of repeating consonant sounds, specifically the "K" and "N" sounds. Although the words have different meanings, the consonance in their structure contributes to their overall similarity in sound and appearance, making it a literary technique called consonance.</s>
boaters, abts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "boaters-abts" can be considered exhibiting consonance, as they both consist of three letter words where the final letter of the first word (o and a) both end in the same consonant sound (b). Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within words, and in this case, the "-er" and "-ts" sounds help create a sense of similarities between the words.</s>
sowed, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do show consonance because both words contain the same final sound, specifically the "s" sound (the first words ends with 'z' and the second with 'es', which are phonetically transformed to 's' which also sound similar).</s>
pritz, pirouettes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The justifications for this assertion are that both words, "pritz-pirouettes", have identical or closely similar consonant sounds at the beginning of the words. The word "pirouette" typically features a double "r" sound (which is also present in the word "pritz-pirouettes") as well as a "p" sound which is also present in the word "pritz-pirouettes'. This type of consonancy is called alliteration, and it creates a rhythmic effect in the words.</s>
platz, pilots, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of a particular consonant sound in neighboring words or within a group of words. In the given example, "platz-pilots," the repetition of "z" is not a complete consonant sound and thus does not qualify as consonance.</s>
rahn, raine, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance is a figure of speech wherein a repeated consonant sound near the beginning of words is used repeatedly to create a smooth and musical effect. These two words, "rahn" and "raine," do not appear to contain such repeated consonants. Instead, "raine" begins with a "w" sound, which is different from the "n" sound in "rahn." Therefore, they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
peko, apec, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "peko-apec" show consonance because it presents a pattern of consonant sounds that runs throughout the word. In this case, it starts with the sound represented in "p," continues with "k" sound in "ko," ends with "c" sound in "apec." These consonant sounds create a sense of similarity or matching in the word, thus evoking the concept of consonance.</s>
heman, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schul, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In this sentence, "schul-zelia," the -u and -l patterns in the consonant sounds (sh, ch, ll, and l) seem to be used in a deliberate and pleasing way. The repetition of consonant sounds often creates an interesting and musical effect when used in poetry and can give a poem or a sentence a more pleasing and memorable quality, which is why it is often recognized as a characteristic of poetry.</s>
sewed, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sewed" and "kisling" show consonance because both words have matching consonants at the end. S and K in "sewed" and L in "kisling." Consonance is a literary device where the repetition of consonant sounds adds emphasis and can enhance the meaning of the text.</s>
conn., elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

When evaluating consonance, we look for patterns or similarities in the consonant sounds between words. In the provided words, "conn-elcotel," there is no pattern that resembles each other in terms of consonants.</s>
pasta, pistor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

In these words "pasta" and "pistor" have the "ST" and "TR" consonant pairing. This type of consonance is known as "sibilance" or "fricative repetition" as it involves repeating a particular fricative sound. Both "S" and "T" in these words are fricative sounds, hence "S-T" sound appears two times in both words. This repetition of sounds contributes to the poetic qualities of the words and gives them a sense of harmony.</s>
kuehner, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kuehner-jamb" show consonance.

In poetry and literature, consonance refers to recurring consonant sounds in close proximity within a line or across lines. In the given phrase "kuehner-jamb," the word "jamb" has the vowel sound of "a" (pronounced /ə/) and shares the consonant sounds "k" with "kuehner."</s>
dravo, dr, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
maddy, emde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "maddy-emde" show consonance because they share a repetition of the "m" and "d" consonant sounds, which creates a harmonious and pleasing effect.</s>
alcoa's, keeny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words share consonance between the first syllable (/ALEK/ vs. /KEE/).</s>
homan, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
hoheisel, heisler, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
lacaze, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lacaze-gertner" show consonance.

Justification:
Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in close proximity within a line of poetry. In the given example, one can observe that both words start with "la," "ca," "se," and "te" which are all consonant sounds. Thus, it meets the criteria of consonance.</s>
silsby, schley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "silsby-schley" show consonance since they both consist of the same initial consonant sound 's' and the same final consonant sound 'y'. Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when two or more words have similar consonant sounds in close proximity to each other.</s>
homan, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "homan" and "risner" show consonance. Both words share similar consonant sounds at the end of their respective words (h and n), resulting from the repetition of similar consonants. Consonance suggests words to have the same or near-same sounds. In this case, "homan" shares "hm" sound and "risner" shares "rn" sound.</s>
sader, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sader-knacks" show consonance, as they both have the letter combination "sk" in the middle word, in this case 'sader' and 'knacks'. This letter combination creates consonantal similarity in both words which is the basis of consonance.</s>
schuele, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance occurs when consecutive or nearly consecutive vowel sounds in a line of poetry are accompanied by identical or nearly identical consonant sounds. The words "schuele-jimi" do not have consonant sounds that replicate each other.</s>
nichter, ancheta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "nichter-ancheta" show consonance, as both words start with the consonant cluster "nc." Consonance is a writing technique that involves using similar consonant sounds in close proximity within a sentence, as in this case.</s>
coone, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "coone-jemmie" show consonance because they have consecutive consonant letters. In this case, there is a "c" followed by two "n"s and then another "c". This pattern of consecutive consonant letters is known as consonance and can give a poem a musical and flowing quality.</s>
sued, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sued-hermann" show consonance.

In this case, "sued" and "hermann" are consonant with each other because "s" and "h" are consonant sounds that form words. In the English language, two words can be said to exhibit consonance when they consist of the same or similar vowel sounds, which is not the case here.</s>
canney, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "canney" and "premo" do show consonance in the shared consonants "cn" and "m".

Consonance refers to the use of the same or similar consonant sounds at the end of words in a phrase or sentence. In this case, both words share the same consonant "n" and the sequence of consonant sounds "c-n-y" in the first word and "p-r-m" in the second word creates a pleasing sound. This is one way words can convey similar or related meanings due to their shared characteristics.</s>
camm, came, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "camm-came" does show consonance.

The word "camm-came" does show consonance, as the letters "c" and "m" are both voiceless consonants. In this case, the pattern of voiceless consonant letters creating a consistent sound between the two words is referred to as consonance. This phenomenon can create a sense of rhythm and unity in written or spoken language, evoking a stronger impact on the reader or listener.</s>
lacaze, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lacaze-primo" show consonance, as the ending "tro" is repeated in two consecutive letters. This creates both internal and syllabic consonance within the two words.</s>
rosen, rosanne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Justification: 
At the end of both words, there are consecutive consonants: "sn" and "an" in each of the words. Consonance occurs when the speaker or writer uses the same vowel sound at the end of two or more words in a sequence, typically in the same line or stanza. So, the "-sn" and "-an" endings in both words create the consonant pattern that indicates consonance.</s>
kaner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

The words "kaner-elcotel" do not exhibit consonance because they do not have any matching consonants at the beginning or end of the words. Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when two or more words have at least one consonant in common, usually sharing the same or a similar-sounding consonant. Since "kaner" and "elcotel" do not share any common consonant, the word pair does not show consonance.</s>
sawed, olokuei's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sawed-olokuei" exhibit consonance, as the letter 'a' in 'sawed' is pronounced the same as the 'o' in 'olokuei'.</s>
dedeaux, dud, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dedeaux-dud" show a form of consonance, specifically intervocalic consonance and alliteration.

In this case, the term "consonance" generally refers to the manner in which related or similar sounds are used within a word or phrase. Here, the first word "dedeaux" and the second word "dud" share a high degree of consonance, as there are repeated consonant sounds "d" in both words. This is evident in the structure and spelling: 

"de de aux de u d" in the first word and 
"de u de u d" in the second word.

The intervocalic consonance (the presence of consonant sounds between vowels) as well as the alliteration (the repetition of the same consonant sound at the beginning of words) gives the appearance of consonance.</s>
kut, actor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kut-actor" show consonance, as the consonant sounds 'k' and 't' are placed next to each other in both words. This is a form of syllable or phonetic repetition, where the same or similar consonant sounds occur in close succession. Consonance helps create a consistent and rhythmic pattern that aids in poetic composition and reading. In this case, the "k" and "t" sounds in "kut" and "actor" create a simple consonance pattern, as the syllables 'kut-act-or' are similar in appearance and are read in a close succession.</s>
kanne, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kanne-sumerlin" show consonance. Here's why:

When we analyze the words, "kanne" and "sumerlin," we can see that there are two series of consonant sounds. Both the words have the 'k' and 'n' sounds followed by different vowel sounds - 'a' in "kanne" and 'e' in "sumerlin". The repeated consonant cluster (k- and n-) allows for consonance between the two words, providing a parallelism of sound in the words.</s>
lady's, eliades, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schlee, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. "Schlee-kanner" is a misspelling or alteration of a proper name, and it is difficult for a computer to determine the intended word without context. However, applying basic consonant recognition, it seems that "Schlee-kanner" contains only two different consonants: "S" and "K". There are no instances of same consonants in a row to recognize consonance.</s>
gemmer, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gemmer-heman" show consonance. The consonant pattern in this case is the letter "m", as it appears at the end of each word. Consonance is created when two or more words in a line or phrase have the same final consonant sound.</s>
gumm, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. In this case, the pairs of adjacent consonants are "g-u", "m-i", and "a-c". This consonant matching creates a harmonious sound between the words, which is a key characteristic of consonance in poetry.</s>
node, indy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "node-indy" show consonance. 

Consonance is a figure of speech in which consecutive consonant sounds are used in a similar way. In this case, "node" and "indy" both have the consonant sound "nd" and the letter pattern "nd" appears at the end of both the words. This repetition of similar consonant sounds in the same line or throughout a poem can create a rhythmic and aesthetically pleasing effect.</s>
pilz, apple's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "pilz-apple's" show some consonance.

The justification behind this is that "pilz" consists of two words: "pil" (a bird, small songbird like a thrush), and "z" (which remains unchanged). The "z" in the original German word has been translated into 's without changing the essence of the word. While "apple" has no specific consonant relationship to the rest of the word, the consonant "s" appears at the end of each word, serving as a consonance effect.</s>
curtis', kites, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "curtis'-kites" show consonance, as the 'k' sound is repeated in both words.</s>
hun, hano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, there is consonance in the words "hun-hano". The words both contain the consonant sequence "hn", which creates a similar sound and rhythmic effect.</s>
interact, ancheta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "interact" and "ancheta" show consonance because they both have a set of consonant sounds that are repeated, namely "t" and "a" in both words. This phenomenon, known as consonance, is a rhetorical device that helps create a musicality to the language and can add emphasis to certain words or phrases.</s>
flay, fallaw, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of the same consonant sounds in a sequence of words without regard to vowels. In "flay-fallaw," while the words "flay" and "fallaw" have the same first and last sounds, they do not have the same vowel sounds. Therefore, the words do not exhibit consonance as defined.</s>
cod, schaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. However, to justify the use of this term in this context, it is essential to understand the concept first. 

Consonance refers to the similarity of consonant sounds at the end of different words or syllables in a line of poetry. Both words 'cod-schaal' and 'cod' share a common sound at the end – /k/ and /ʃ/ respectively. 'Cod' is a type of fish, while 'schaal' is a Dutch word derived from the Latin word 'scala', meaning scale. Although the word 'schaal' does not share a common consonant sound with cod like the first one mentioned, the sound similarity between the two words is due to the first syllable, 'cod', which contributes to the consonance of the entire phrase.

In conclusion, both 'cod' and 'schaal' have a similar consonant sound /k/ and /ʃ/ at the end of their respective words. Taking this into account, it is deemed that the words show a form of consonance.</s>
ablate, ability, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

I identify the consonance by looking at the consonant sounds found at the end of each word. "bleat" has "le," "ability" has "li," and "ability" contains "bi," making these words share a common vowel sound. This results in the consonance effect.</s>
storch, sitrick, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words do show some consonance as they share the '-st-' ending. However, the use of '-th' in storch and '-tr-' in Sitrick do not create the same level of consonance as in words such as 'brother-sister' or 'spare-paring'. Nonetheless, they still share a common sound or pattern.</s>
sawdey, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of the same or similar consonant sounds within a word or a phrase. In this combination, there are no consonant sounds that are repeated similarly between the two words. In contrast, the first word "sawdey-reisenauer" clearly has a repeated "saw-day" sound at the beginning, while the second word "deer-wish" has a "deer-wish" sound. However, it is important to note that "sawdey-reisenauer" also has a more complex combination of sounds, which may or may not be considered consonance.</s>
plies, apple's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because both words have a group of three consonant sounds that repeat: 'p' 'l' 'i' present in "plies", "a"' 'p' 'l' 'l' 'e' present in "apple", and 'p' 'l' 'i' present in both words together. This consonance adds to the overall rhythm and musicality of the words.</s>
weirder, ward, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words show consonance. 

"Weirder-ward" contains a series of adjacent consonant sounds, which is commonly referred to as consonance. As you can see, both words end with the same consonant sequence, 'WER' in 'weirder,' and 'DR' in 'ward.' The repetition of the same consonant shapes in close proximity creates a sense of musical rhythm, often leading to an increase in the listener's perception of the words' beauty, aesthetic appeal, and overall pleasing characteristic. This is considered a common effect and a prominent structural aspect in literature, particularly in poetry.</s>
szalay, gemmer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sewed, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  

No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds, particularly at the end of words or at key points within a word. In this case, there is only a slight, rather than substantial, repetition of the "w" sound at the end of the first and second words. The repetition of "w" only makes up a small portion of the sound pattern and is therefore not enough to be qualified as consonance.</s>
maruska, mosco, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "maruska-mosco" exhibit consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device where words are repeated in a sentence or speech in close proximity in terms of the consonant sounds. In this case, we see the same 's' sound in both words: maruska-mosco. This repetition creates a musical and pleasing effect called homophony. Therefore, the words "maruska-mosco" display consonance.</s>
rotan, retin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "rotan" and "retin" show consonance due to the repetition of the "t" sound in the final three letters of each word.

- "rotan": the "t" sound can be heard in the spelled out word "ton"
- "retin": the "t" sound can be heard in the spelled out word "tin"</s>
fleurette, flutter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "fleurette-flutter" exhibit consonance, as they share two consecutive consonants, "u" in "fleurette" and "t" in "flutter." Consonance is an intentional literary technique that uses repeated consonant sounds to create a musical effect in a poem or text, providing a rhythmical pattern that can impact the reader's perception of the words used.</s>
nix, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "nix-gemme" show consonance, as both words share a set of consonant sounds in their structures. The words "nix" and "gemme" do show a minor level of consonance with identical sounds in the "-nx-" (nix) and "-m-" (gemme) parts of the words.</s>
arid, roadie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
shula, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shula-baran" do show consonance, meaning they have many similar consonant sounds in a row, such as "sh" and "b". This creates a rhythmic pattern, making it easier to remember and appreciate the words.</s>
petrilli, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "petrilli-arseneau" show consonance. The word "petrilli" consists of the consonant cluster "ptrl" and the ending "-ili", while the word "arseneau" consists of the consonant cluster "srns" and the ending "-eau". These consonant clusters and endings create a repetition of the same consonant sounds which is an example of consonance in poetry.</s>
treen, tyrone, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words use the sound "n" in the middle of the words, creating consonance. The word "tree" followed by the word "ton" shows similar consonant sounds.</s>
dawes, owades, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do show consonance.
Consonance occurs when repeated consonant sounds appear next to each other within the same line of poetry. In the phrase "dawes-owades," the 'a' and 'w' consonant sounds are repeated both times, creating a pleasing internal rhyme and consonance. Consonance helps to create a smooth and pleasing flow in a poem, contributing to its overall effect.</s>
geitner, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In the given word, geitner-jimmy, the consonant sounds at the end of 'geitner' and the beginning of 'jimmy' create a similar consonant pattern, which is a form of consonance called "sibilance" (the repetition of a sound or sounds). The pattern we observe is "gt-n," "jm."</s>
schuler, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "schuler-prem" do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in nearby vowels within a phrase or word. In the given word "schuler-prem," the repetition of the consonant 's' in the first and fifth letters is the only consonant sound. However, there are no other instances of consonant sounds to form a pattern, leading to the absence of consonance in the given words.</s>
sudd, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "sudden" and "knit" show consonance.</s>
leads, lady's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "leads-lady's" shows consonance, as the 'l' sound is repeated and connected in the word, giving it a similar sound and rhythm.</s>
ma, 'em, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
acid, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "acid-noxso" show consonance because they both have the consonant 'x' in the same position in the word.</s>
seider, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "seider-next" shows consonance. The syllables are stressed in a balanced way, and the letters that follow the stress have similar consonant sounds: s, s, r, n. However, consonance by itself does not significantly improve the reading experience.</s>
coody, kid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words do show consonance. In this case, the consonant sequence "oo" appears in both words, "coody" and "kid". This phenomenon, known as consonance, occurs when there is a repetition of similar consonant sounds within a line of poetry, or in this case, within a pair of words. This device can enhance the rhythm and emotional impact of written or spoken word.</s>
tamke, tomko, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, there is some consonance between the words "tamke" and "tomko" in the sequence "tamke-tomko." This consonance is achieved through the repetition of the letter "m," which is a common sonorant sound that contributes to the overall rhythm of each word.</s>
keeny, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "keeny-electoral" show consonance, as the "n" and "r" in each word create a pattern of similar consonant sounds.</s>
shein, ocean, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds, usually at the end of words or near the end of syllables. In this case, both "shin" and "ocean" have the same consonant sound ("n"), and there is a repetition of this sound at the end of both words. This gives a certain rhythmic quality to the words and makes them similar in sound.</s>
faz, fuzz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
pty, patois, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "pty-patois" show consonance. Both words have the letters "p" and "t" repeating in two positions: they have 'pty' and 'tos' in each of the words. Additionally, the words have a consonant-vowel-consonant pattern in each word. So, the answer is: Yes, the words show consonance.</s>
mentel, minutely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mentel" and "minutely" show consonance. 

Explanation: 
Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when similar or consonant sounds are repetitively used in a sequence, within a single line of poetry or speech. In this case, both words end with the consonant 'l', creating the consonant sound sequence "n-ment-minu-l-l-y." This repetition of the same consonant sound contributes to the overall sound pattern in each word.</s>
kerby, aqaba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kerby-aqaba" show consonance. 

Consonance is a poetic device that involves the repetition of consonant sounds near each other in a line of poetry. In the words "kerby-aqaba," the "k" sound is repeated twice - first as part of "kerby" and then in the final word, "aqaba" - near the end of the line. This repetition can enhance the musicality and rhythm of the language, creating a pleasing sound.</s>
o'conner, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "o'conner" and "jama" show consonance because they both end with the consonant "a." The presence of this shared consonant creates a pattern of similarity, which is a part of consonance in poetry.</s>
horse, haris, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "horse-haris" do not demonstrate consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of the same consonant sound at the end of words or syllables. The two words "horse" and "haris" share the consonant "s" at the end, but they do not have significant consonance in the sense of the same consonant sound at different points in the word or string of words.</s>
cause, kay's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance. 

Consonance is a figure of speech or trope where words are repeated near each other, using the same or similar consonant sounds. In the given example "cause-kay's," both words have the same initial sound of "k," making them an instance of consonance.</s>

achene, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. The word "achene-germer" is not a single word; it consists of two separate words - "achen" and "germer." The consonant repetition occurs between the individual words, indicating no true consonance between the two components of the word.</s>
kain, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because both "kain" and "brion" have the same consonant sequence "kn-n". Consonance is a figure of speech in which there are repetitions of consonant sounds or syllables with some distance between them. In this case, both words contain kain (pronounced with the 'k' sound) and brion (pronounced with the 'b' sound), which create a rhythmic and musical effect.</s>
enex, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "enex" and "braner" do show some consonance - specifically the "n" and "r" sounds are present in both words. The consonance in these words is a result of the repetition of similar consonant sounds.</s>
scholey, gumm, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "scholey-gumm" do not show consonance because they do not have any common distinct consonant sounds. Though both words start with "sch," the other letters differ, making consonance not present.</s>
borneo, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "borneo-premo" show consonance. This is because the words have a pattern where one or more consecutive letters are repeated consecutively, creating a rhythmic effect. In the given example "borneo-premo," we see repetition of the letter "o" in both words, which adds to the rhythmic pattern.</s>
scholl, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the consonance in the words "scholl-reasner" is found in the "ll" sound, which is repeated in the second and fourth letters, creating a pattern. This pattern of repeated sounds makes the words more rhythmic and potentially memorable.</s>
liebe, laborer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "liebe" and "laborer" show consonance, as they both have the letter 'b' adjacent with their vowels 'i' and 'e' at the end respectively. This creates a pattern of vowels and consonants that adds musicality and beauty to the words, which is a form of poetry known as "consonance."</s>
follmer, flaim, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

The words "follmer-flaim" show consonance because they both start with the consonant sounds "f" in the words "follmer" and "flaim," which are in close proximity in the same order in both pairs of words. This type of literary device, known as consonance, involves repetition of a consonant sound to create resonance and musicality in language.</s>
kanai, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kanai-elcotel" show consonance. In this case, the words have similar consonant sounds: "ka" in "kanai" and "el" in "elcotel."</s>
uhlich, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance is the repetition of the same or similar consonant sounds at the end of words in a sentence or phrase. If you were considering assonance, the repetition of similar vowel sounds, then 'uhlich-jamb' would constitute such a phrase, as 'ch' is not a repeating consonant.</s>
gummi, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gummi-elcotel" show consonance. The reason is that 'um', 'mu', 'mu', and 'tel' sound very similar. Consonance is a literary technique where two or more words have the same consonant sounds, often in close proximity to each other. This creates a musical rhythm in the sentence and conveys a pleasing effect.</s>
maids', moody's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words do show consonance.
It's because the word 'maids'-moody's' has a specific consonance pattern which can be seen as alliteration. Both words begin with an 'm' sound. Additionally, the repetition of a letter at the end of words is a defining feature of alliteration. Although in this case it's not particularly poetic or literary alliteration, it still qualifies as a type of onomatopoeia - a sound effect. So in a broader sense, it exhibits consonance.</s>
pilz, ploys, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "pilz-ploys" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of a line of poetry or within a word, typically at the end of a word or syllable (either by vocalization or phonological process). In "pilz-ploys," "pilz" and "ploys" both end with the same consonant sound "s," which creates a rhythmical quality that may be pleasing to the ear. This repetition contributes to the overall poetic effect.</s>
ocon, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance due to the repetition of the letter "c" in the word 'ocon-jamb', which contributes to a rhythmic and melodic structure in the words.</s>
necks, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "necks-smolen" show consonance.

Justification:
The word "smolen" has the same consonant sounding syllables "sm-ol-en" as in the pair "necks-smolen" and the consonant sounds "sm" are repeated. The first word shows a consonance pattern.</s>
soady, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance because the repeated consonant sounds in the words are not pronounced in a similar way. In "soady-germe," the "s" in "soady" and the "c" in "germe" both have similar rounded back of the mouth consonant sounds (one in the middle and one at the end), but they are not pronounced identically. In "soady," the first "s" is said with the tongue tipped forward, while in "germe," the second "s" is pronounced more like a "k" with the tongue pushed back.</s>
ebright, berti, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "ebright" and "berti" do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when words in a line or phrase have at least two consecutive consonant sounds or vowel and consonant sounds. In these two words, there is only one consonant sound and no consecutive consonant sounds.</s>
pfohl, fallaw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "pfohl" and "fallaw" show consonance in the sense of having matching or closely related consonant sounds. However, it's important to note that consonance is not limited to direct matches between consonants; it can also involve the use of like consonant sounds or echoes of consonants throughout the written or spoken word. In this case, "pfohl" and "fallaw" have a similarity in their initial consonant sounds. Hence, it can be considered as a case of consonance.</s>
keene, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "keene" and "brun" show consonance. This refers to when two words have one or more consecutive consonant sounds in the same order, regardless of the number of words, syllables or letters between them. In this case, both words have the letters 'k-n-n' in the same order, so they exhibit consonance.</s>
deigned, deanda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do show consonance. The "-d-" sound is consistent in both words, creating a consonant cluster between the two vowel sounds.</s>
imes, mae's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do show consonance. When the consonant sounds in the two words ("imes-mae's") are similar without the vowel sounds being the same, this is called consonance. In this case, the sequence of consonants (m-e-s-m) is similar in both words, making them appear consonant-heavy.</s>
gertner, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gertner-knacks" show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary device where two or more words or phrases display the same or similar consonant sounds at the end of the words. In this case, both words have a "-t-" sound at the end, creating a consonant echo effect.</s>
americus, marcos', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "americus" and "marcos" show consonance due to the repeated consonant sound "rs".</s>
pisa, pesce, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words "pisa-pesce" do show consonance.

This phenomenon can be observed when words or phrases sound more alike because of their consonant sounds. In this case, you can hear that both words start with the sounds "p" and "s" (pisa and pesce), giving them a similarity in their consonant sounds, so they are consonant-wise, more similar to each other. 

In linguistic terminology, this sort of sound similarity is called onomatopoeia and can be a characteristic of both consonance and other rime-based poetry features such as alliteration or syllabic repetition.</s>
hamner, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hamner" and "prem" show consonance, as both words feature the "mn" sound at the beginning, similar to the first sound in "hammer" and "smile". Consonance is a rhythmic device that occurs when there are similar consonant sounds in words or phrases next to each other within a line of poetry or prose.</s>
schaal, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, there is consonance in the words "schaal-hohman".

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in adjacent words or syllables. In the given words "schaal-hohman", the sounds "sc" and "kh" at the beginning of the first word are repeated in the second word. This forms consonance. The sound "k" creates a smooth transition between the syllables while maintaining visual and phonetic rhythm.</s>
garry, gore, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "garry-gore" show consonance. 

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words or syllables, usually within a line of poetry. In "garry-gore," there is a pattern of consonant sounds, as both words end with the consonant 'r.' The process of identifying consonance within a word or phrase is subjective, as personal perception, comprehension, and interpretation of sound patterns can vary.</s>
schoeller, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. There is no consistency in consonant sounds between the two words "schoeller" and "easel".</s>
kanne, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

In the words "kanne-smullen", both words contain the letters "ck" and "ll", which are repeated within the word in similar sounding consonance. Consonance is a rhetorical device used in poetry where the same consonant sound can be repeated at the end of a phrase or syllable to create emphasis and aesthetic effect. In this specific case, the words "kanne-smullen" show a form of consonance due to the repeating sounds of "ck" and "ll" which enhance the meaning and flow of the words.</s>
gotten, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gotten" and "next," when paired together, exhibit consonance. This is an onomatopoeic or rhythmic effect in literary language, where the sounds made by the corresponding consonants of words create a similar pattern. In this case, both the words share the 'g' - 'n' - [vowel] - 'x' sequence.</s>
opus, pearse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Justification:
The words "opus-pearse" have similar consonant sounds in the beginning of each word (o, p, p, a, r, s). This is an example of consonance, a figure of speech used when words in a sentence have similar consonant sounds without necessarily rhyming.</s>
blotter, ability, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "blotter-ability" show consonance, as the repetition of the "tl" and "br" sounds can be considered a linguistic pattern and creates a rhythmic consistency between the two words. However, it should be noted that consonance is also used to denote other uses of consonant or vowel patterns, such as alliteration, assonance, or even echoic resonance, none of which are present in this pairing of words.</s>
schueler, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schueler-breon" show consonance.

In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds, including the consonant in the end of the words. The "-on" ending in both words is a type of onomatopeia, which is a literary device used to create a verbal representation of a certain sound or expression. The sound "-on" often conveys a soft, gentle, or peaceful vibe and serves as a musical counterpoint to the other sounds in the word.</s>
seder, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "seder" and "hymen" show consonance. They both include the letters "h," "d," and "e," which are consecutive in both words. Consonance is a poetic device that occurs when consecutive vowel sounds are often repeated within a sentence, phrase, or line. Here, the "-ed" ending has been removed from "seder" and remains in "hymen," but they still maintain their original consonance.</s>
barn, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
barstow, braced, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  The words "barstow" and "braced" do show consonance. Both words end with the letter "d", and there is no vowel sound (such as 'a' or 'o') that would disrupt the consonant flow. So, the answer is 'Yes'.</s>
cycare, screw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schley, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "schley-jam" shows consonance between the 's' and 'z' sounds in the initial and final consonant clusters of the two words. This phenomenon is called onset-rime consonance or consonance of sound.</s>
moulder, imelda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "moulder" and "imelda" show consonance. The consonance in this case is created by the two "d" sounds which are both present in both words.</s>
throne, theron, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because both "throne-theron" and "words" share certain consonants, specifically the "th" and "n" sounds.</s>
multiprocessor, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. In this case, both words share the 'psr'- sound at the end, which contributes to the overall consonance between the two words.</s>
brun, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "brun-electoral" shows consonance because it has a shared sound between the first and second syllables, which is the occurrence of the same consonants in adjacent syllables, creating a sense of unity in sound and language.</s>
ashley, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ashley" and "bryna" show consonance in that both words end with the same two consonant sounds (l and a).</s>
gaetano, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gaetano-breon" show consonance because both words start with the consonant "g" and end with the consonant "n". This type of sound similarity between words is known as consonance.</s>
side, hermon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because they both end with the same consonant sound (in this case, "m").</s>
altay, alta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the two words do show consonance. Both words have the consonant "l" sound in the first and last syllables of the words, making them appear related.</s>
aside, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the use of repeated consonant sounds in words in close proximity, usually at the end of words. In "aside-noakes," the repeated sounds are "s" and "e," which are found in the words "aside" and "noakes." However, the words do not have close proximity or consecutive occurrence of sounds, so consonance is not effective in these words.</s>
muske, majeske, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "muske-majeske" show consonance. 

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within words in a line of verse. In the given sequence "muske-majeske," the repeated consonant 's' at the end of each word contributes to the consonance effect.</s>
morlan, marleene, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'morlan-marleene' show consonance.

Explanation: In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in close proximity. In this case, the words 'morlan-marleene' both have a 'm' (pronounced sound) and a 'r' (pronounced sound) sound in their last two letters. Though the vowel sounds are different, the combination 'mm' is used in both words and contributes to the overall sound of the compound word 'morlan-marleene.'</s>
poopers, puppies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance, as they share the "P" and "S" sound in the middle of the word. This consonantal pattern creates an interesting, unexpected sound in the word "poopers-puppies," which adds to its overall appealing quality.</s>
sued, oelkers, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  The words provided are "sued-oelkers." The hyphen between "oelkers" and the "-" in "sued" create a consonant sound, which may help to achieve consonance. So, the answer is Yes, these words show some degree of consonance.</s>
aqaba, coby, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "aqaba-coby" show consonance because "q" and "c" are both oral stops, which are similar in pronunciation. This consonance occurs in the second and the fourth syllables of the two words.</s>
zulli, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance is a literary device wherein like consonant sounds at the end of words or syllables are used together, often in repetition. In the given words "zulli-kain", only the "z" sound is repeated.

However, in order to show consonance, the words should share more than one common consonant sound at the end of the words or syllables. For example, if we modify the words to "flour-cake" then there is a repetition of like consonant sounds at the end ("fl" and "cak"). The words "zulli-kain" do not show this characteristic of consonance.</s>
lovitz, elevates, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lovitz-elevates" show consonance, as the vowel sounds of "e" are similar and share an approximate rhyme in both words. Consonance occurs when the preceding or following consonant or consonants match or sound similar in at least two words in a row or group of words.</s>
courtesy, cates, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "courtesy" and "cates" show consonance. 

Consonance is the repetition of a vowel sound (or a cluster of sounds) in the same line or stanza, where two or more words share a common ending consonant sound. In this case, both "courtesy" and "cates" end with the consonant sound 'ts', creating a consonant pair.</s>
schuller, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schuller-litigating" show consonance. 

In this pair of words, the consonance is formed by the initial consonant "c" ('sh' in "schuller" and 's' in "litigating"). Consonance is a figure of speech that involves repetition of consonants sounds within a word. The presence of this characteristic sound pattern across the two words links together, creating a sense of unity or relatedness.</s>
nyx, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

In the given words "nyx-bran," the letters "x" and "n" are followed by "b" in the first word, and they are both repeated in the second word. This repetition of the consonant "b" near the end of each word creates a musicality or rhythmic pattern that is commonly referred to as consonance in literature and poetry. 

This consonance helps create a sense of sound and rhythm in the words, which can enhance the overall meaning and impact of a poem or written work.</s>
cannery, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cannery" and "smolen" do show consonance. Both words feature the sound of the letter "n" (cannery and smolen) occurring in the middle of the word where there is a common vowel (smolen and smiling).</s>
dawes, doers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dawes-doers" show consonance. The justification for this determination is that consonance is a rhetorical technique used in poetry or poetry-like forms where two or more words have similar or identical sounds. In this case, both words contain the vowel sound "a" followed by "w" and "s" and they both create a similar consonant pattern of "d" and "w." They both involve words with a "w" sound.</s>
astley, settle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "astley-settle" show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech where there are repeated consonant sounds, usually at the end of two or more words in a line of poetry. In this case, the repeated consonant sounds are "-ley" and "-tle," and they are found at the ends of both words.</s>
kissling, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kissling-ozelle" show consonance, as the letters K, S, T, and L at the beginning of the second and fourth syllables create patterns of consonant sounds that are repeated.

Letter-sound consonance is when words possess consonant sounds that follow the same pattern, enabling speakers and readers to perceive the pattern as a unity. In this case, the K and L sounds create a consistent pattern from the second syllable of the first word to the second and fourth syllables of the second word, allowing for a greater sense of unity and continuity in sound throughout the two words. In linguistics, consonance is an important element in language, as it can help shape meaning and convey information through consistent letter patterns and rhymes.</s>
acid, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

The consonance is the repetition of the same or similar consonant sounds in a sequence of words. In this case, the words "acid," "high," and "man" share the "c" and "d" sounds:

1. "Acid" has the consonants "c" and "d."
2. "High" contains the consonants "g" and "a."
3. "Man" features the consonant "n."

By having these repeating consonant sounds in each word, the words demonstrate consonance.</s>
szalay, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do show consonance. This technique is known as alliteration, where words in a phrase begin with the same consonant sound, in this case, "s" in "szalay" and "h" in "health." The repetition of these consonant sounds creates a sense of unity and repetition in the phrase, which can make the text more rhythmic and memorable.</s>
garroz, gruis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
aird, roadie, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds within words within a single text or line of poetry. In the words "aird-roadie," the letters "d" and "r" appear as single letters only, not paired consonants, so there is no consonance.</s>
surat, esty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "surat-esty" show consonance.

Justification:
Consonance is the repetition of consonants sounds (usually the last two letters of consecutive words), which gives the words a musical effect when they are pronounced quickly. In "surat-esty," both words share a common ending -sty, creating a short, clear consonant sound. This consonance makes the phrase sound pleasing to the ear, potentially evoking the idea of poetry. Therefore, the words exhibit a form of consonance.</s>
cernuda's, sandos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
laack, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

Both words possess the same number of vowels and consonants, and both sequences of letters are the same, containing the consonants "l", "a", "c", "k", "g", "m" and "r", except for a minor difference in the placement of their final vowel. This similarity in structure contributes to the feeling of consonance between the two words.</s>
oconnor, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "O'Connor-Bowron" show consonance, which is the repetition or near-repetition of consonant sounds. In this case, the words share the "n" and "r" sounds before the '-'.</s>
smullen, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "smullen-jammer" show consonance, as they both have the consonant sequence '-l-n-j-m-r' in the first syllable.</s>
shelley, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. The words "shelley" and "oconnor" do not share any consonant sounds or matching consonant patterns.</s>
shaul, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance is a literary effect where repeated consonant sounds are accented, either in the same or nearby syllables. In this case, the words "shaul-zelia" do not exhibit any repeated consonants within the same syllable, and the consecutive consonants are not closely placed either.</s>
strnad, standre, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when two or more words in a sentence have the same final consonant sound. In the words strnad-standre, there is no final consonant sound that matches in both words.</s>
koehne, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "koehne-berna" show consonance.

In terms of consonance, these two words start with the same consonant sound in the first syllable, but do not continue the same sequence or makeup. The word "koehne" shares a "k" and "h" sound with "berna," but it has a different vowel and final "a" consonant. Therefore, even though the individual consonant sounds are the same, the overall sound and pronunciation do not maintain the same series of consonant sounds, which is what consonance is.</s>
arrow, err, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "arrow-err" show consonance, as they share three continuous consonant sounds - "arr" in both words.</s>
alcoa's, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

A pattern of common letter sounds at the end of words, known as consonance, can create a rhythmic unity or a suggestive effect in a piece of writing. Alcoa's-bran contains the letters 'sh' sound in both words ('Alcoa' and 'bran'), which can be seen as a pattern of consonance. This sound effect can imply a sense of stability, strength, or a connection between the two words.</s>
scholey, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, some consonance can be observed in these words "scholey-hergert." Both words begin and end with the same consonant sound, which is "th" (sounded as a "t" sound). This forms a slight pattern of sound and is an example of consonance, a poetic device.</s>
aickin, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show any pronounced consonance. Although both words start with the same letter (a), they use different consonants for most of their consonant clusters (ickin-geremia). In this sense, the similarity in the beginning letters does not carry any greater resemblance in the actual consonant sounds.</s>
shiller, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  For consonance to be present in the given words, the consonant sounds must be repeated in a relatively close sequence, often involving two or more syllables. In the case of "shiller-enix," the repeating consonant sound is the 'sh' in "shill." Although this repetition of consonant sound is present, the spelling and the way the words are structured do not make the words truly consonant in terms of their sound patterns. To show consonance, the spelling and sound would need to be more closely aligned.

Answer: No</s>
ward, weirdo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The two words have the same three consecutive consonant sounds (w-w-e).</s>
schley, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words, "schley-zarroli", exhibit consonance.

Consonance refers to a literary device used in poetry or songwriting in which the same consonant sound appears at the end of multiple words. In this instance, both "schley" and "zarroli" end with the consonant "r". This creates an auditory pattern for the reader or listener when these words are grouped together, which may add an extra layer of depth and musicality to the presentation.</s>
tay, thai, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "tay-thai" show consonance, as both words have the "t" and "y" consonant sounds at the beginning and the "ai" sound at the end.</s>
alleva, leever, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

The words "alleva-leever" do not show consonance, as the only common consonant present in the word is the "v" in "alleva". Without considering syllables or meaning, we can simply say that consonants are "leever" without a vowel present. Therefore, it does not create and maintain consonance in the word.</s>
cahn, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cahn-brawny" show consonance.

In this case, consonance refers to the repetition or similarity of one or more consonants sounds or letters in two or more words, typically in the same line or verse. In the given words "cahn-brawny," the consonant 'c' is repeated in "cahn" and "brawny," creating a pattern of consonant sounds. This repetition of the consonant sound can create a sense of musicality and rhythm in the rhyme scheme.</s>
iacona, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words do not show consonance as they do not share any pairs of like consonants.</s>
daughter, idiot, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because they both end with the sound "ot" (the "-ot" sound). Consonance is the repetition of a consonantal sound in words within a line of poetry. Here, -i, -o, -i, -o and -o sounds are shared consecutively and therefore the sound "ot" is repeated multiple times within the phrase, forming consonance. This poetic aspect provides a rhythm and rhyme effect, adding some musicality to the phrase, which is often the aim of poetry and language arts.</s>
schul, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The words "schul-alcoa's" have the same consonant sounds in certain positions. In this case, "Schu-alcoa's" has a 3-letter, consonant-vowel-consonant pattern, which is known as a 'consonance rhyme.' The word "Schu" is formed using the consonant sounds "sh," "u," and "a" which are present in the consonant vowel consonant (cvc) pattern. Then, the suffix '-alcoa' is added to create the new word 'Schu-alcoa's'. This consonance brings the words into relation with each other and contributes to the sound quality of the phrase.</s>
gama, oelkers, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  The given words "gama-oelkers" do not show consonance because the last letter of each consecutive vowel in the second half of the word, "o" and then "e," has a different combination of consonant sounds than the first half "gama." Thus, they do not show consonance as defined.</s>
raine, arian, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
retool, rattler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "retool-rattler" show consonance. The letter 'l' at the end of both words creates the consonant sounds "l" and "r".</s>
isch, hsieh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "isch-hsieh" show consonance. Both words have the same consonants ("isch" and "hsieh").</s>
boat's, beitz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because they both have the "B" and "Z" sounds. The addition of the vowel "s" in the second word creates a longer vowel sound that adds to the consonant similarity between both words.</s>
conn, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do show consonance. The shared consonant sounds in "conn-bran" are the "n" and "b," which create a subtle but noticeable rhyme between the two words.</s>
idle, dehler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the two words, "idle-dehler," do exhibit consonance, which is a poetic technique in which repeated consonant sounds are found intermittently in a line of poetry. In this specific instance, "idle-dehler" contains the consonant sounds "l," which is repeated twice, and the "i" sound is repeated in both words. The repetition of some consonant sounds creates a musical and rhythmic effect, which can enhance the overall poetic effect.</s>
koehn, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do show consonance, specifically on the -n ending. Consonance is a figure of speech where repeated consonant sounds within a line of poetry create a musical rhythm. In this case, the repetition of the "n" sound creates a pleasant pattern, contributing to the overall musicality of the words.</s>
antell, until, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words do show consonance. They both have the same consonant sound (t) in the second syllables - "tell" and "till". This technique of having repeated consonant sounds at the end of syllables is often referred to as consonance.</s>
gahm, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In this case, the "a" in "gahm" and the "o" in "oslo" both sound like "ah" and "oh," respectively, which produce the same consonant sound in each word. Consonance is a figure of speech where two or more words share the same or similar consonant sounds. In this example, both "gahm" and "oslo" have the same "ah" and "o" sounds, which is a form of consonance.</s>
fires, fors, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes.

These words show consonance because the letter combination "rs" appears in both words, creating a shared sound between them which creates a certain similarity in pronunciation and rhythm. Similar techniques are also used in consonance throughout literature to emphasize a certain word or phrase.</s>
knocked, nichter, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words do not show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in the same line of poetry or speech. In this example, "knocked-nichter" does not have any significant consonant sounds repeated throughout the string. This means that there is no consonance present in the words provided.</s>
brony, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not exhibit consonance, as there's no pattern of repeating consonant sounds between the words "brony" and "smullen". Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in the same phrase or line of poetry, and the given words don't show any such pattern, thus they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
ares, rowser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ares-rowser" show consonance. This is because they both end with the consonant cluster "sr," creating a pattern of similar consonant sounds at the end of the words.</s>
baez, baz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'baez-baz' show consonance. 

Explanation: 
Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when successive sounds in poetry or speech are like or alike in quality (usually in consonant sounds - plosives, affricates, fricatives, or stops). In other words, two of more consecutive vowels and/or consonants share the same sound. In the given words 'baez-baz,' the shared sounds are 'b' in both words, which is an "approximant consonant" and is also the common factor between the two words.</s>
sidener, sidonia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sidener" and "sidonia" show consonance because the two middle letters, "ide," in both words have the same first and last letters.</s>
keene, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

'Consonance', in the context of poetry, refers to the repetition of or sound or texture of consonant letters within a word or between adjacent words. The word pair "keene-bowron" does not have a consonant sound repetition. The first word, "keene," has the vowel sound "ay," and the letters 'n'-'e' followed by the silent 'e.' The second word, "bowron," has a consonant sound repetition of 'o' and 'w,' but it is not consonance because 'o' and 'w' are not pronounced consistently in all instances when speaking these words. Without recognizable or predictable consonant repetition, it's fair to say that 'keene-bowron' doesn't exhibit consonance as required by the definition.</s>
kania, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kania-prem" show consonance because both words share three of five consecutive consonant letters. In this case, "k" appears in both words, as well as "a" in "kania" and "p" in "prem." The words still technically exhibit consonance, but it has a small variation since there is only one consonant "k" shared between the two, whereas the other four consonants are in different positions.</s>
zoll, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. They are German words with similar vowel sounds: 'zoll' and 'ozelle.'</s>
soady, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words exhibit consonance. 

Consonance is a figure of speech or literary device that involves the repetition of consonant or consonant-vowel sounds at the ends of two or more words. In your words, "soady" and "chlorofluorocarbons," the 's' sound at the end of both words creates a repetitive consonant pattern. This gives the words the same consonance quality.

Here is the analysis:

1. "Soady" has the 's' sound at its end.
2. "Chlorofluorocarbons" also has an 's' sound at its end.

The repetition of the 's' sound creates consonance, which makes the two words similar in this aspect.</s>
haman, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In poetry, consonance is the repetition of the ending sounds of words or syllables. In the words "haman-brony", the ending sounds of "haman" and "brony" both end in the same consonant sound, which is -n. This repetition creates an effect that can enhance the poem's rhythm and can sometimes evoke a sense of flow or unity within the lines of the poem. The use of consonance in poetry can be considered a stylistic choice and it can vary from poem to poem.</s>
schmoll, schmehl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In the words "schmoll-schmehl," the '-oll' and '-ehl' syllables share the 'l' and 'ch' consonants, respectively. This is an example of consonance, as it creates a consistent sound at the beginning of each word. This kind of repeated consonant is seen in various poetic and linguistic devices.</s>
poky, apec, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when there is a repetition of consonant sounds in close proximity, such as when the initial consonant sounds reoccur in the surrounding vowel sounds. In the given words "poky-apec," the repetition of the /k/ sound gives a sense of consonance between the two words, even though the words themselves do not share a common root. This repetition of the consonant /k/ adds a musical quality to the words, which contributes to the overall effect of consonance.</s>
nyx, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'nyx-jammer' show consonance.

Consonance is a literary device in which two or more words have the same or similar consonant sounds in a line of poetry. In the phrase "nyx-jammer," both words share the same 'n' and '-x' consonant sounds. This creates a pattern that can add a sense of rhythm and music to the line, allowing the listener or reader to easily remember the sequence of words.</s>
cede, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because both "cede-hohman" and "hohman" have internal consonant sounds "c" and "h." Additionally, "cede" and "hohman" share the consonant "h." Consonance occurs when multiple words or phrases have the same or similar consonant sounds in close succession. In this case, "cede" and "hohman" fit this pattern, showing that consonance is present in these words.</s>
interact, ankita, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

In the words "interact-ankita," the first word has a pattern of ending with a consecutive sequence of consonant letters ("ct"), while the second word has a pattern of ending with a consecutive sequence of two consonant letters ("kt"). This phenomenon of ending with the same consonant letters is known as consonance.</s>
schley, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schley-hamann" exhibit consonance as they both contain the consecutive consonants 'sch' followed by 'ley' and 'man'. This particular sound pattern gives them a shared musicality and adds to the pleasing quality of the word. The "-mann" ending also creates a pleasing and harmonious effect in the pair of words.</s>
seader, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when the same or similar consonant sounds appear at the end of words or words are repeated in a phrase or line of a poem to create a specific effect. In the given example "seader-gaetano," the repetition of the "r" sound at the end of the words is not enough to classify them as consonant-rich. They would need to have additional consonant sounds or sequences for this to be considered consonance.</s>
roesner, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "roesner-primo" do show consonance, as there is a consistent use of the letter "o" in the first syllable of each word, starting with "roes" in the first word and "ro-".</s>
irey, err, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "irey-err" do show consonance as both words end with the consonant sounds "r". This form of speech sound repetition is known as consonance and can add a musical quality to a sentence or word.</s>
haggart, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
atek, attica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. Both words, "atek" and "attica," feature the letters "t" and "c" in the same positions, forming consonant clusters.</s>
koehn, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  The answer is: No.

These words do not show consonance. Consonance is a literary technique where two or more words share the same vowel sound in a phrase or a verse. In the given example, "koehn-barrineau," the words share a consonant ("k" and "m" in 'kee' and 'mare,' respectively) but not the same vowel sound, so they do not show consonance.</s>
ken, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
dyes, dawes, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "dyes" and "dawes" do not show consonance.

Consonance is a literary device that refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in adjacent or closely spaced words. The words "dyes" and "dawes" have the same consonants (y and w) in the root or final position, but they are not next to each other or closely spaced. As a result, they do not exhibit consonance.</s>
royale, orel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "royale-orel" show consonance because both words share the "rr" sound in the second syllable, with "orel" meaning "hand" and "royale" meaning "royal". They exhibit phonetic similarity in the final two letters of each word.</s>
sowder, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sowder-guyton" do show consonance, as the "w" and "g" share the same letter combination in both words. Consonance refers to when the same or similar consonant sounds are used in close succession, either at the beginning, middle, or end of a word or a group of words. In this case, the sequence of consonant sounds is found in both words and contributes to their similarity.</s>
hermon, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "hermon" and "koehn" do not show consonance in terms of the consonant sounds in each word, as they are separate words and not combined. Additionally, "hermon" contains "n" and "m" while "koehn" contains "k" and "hn", so they do not exactly share common consonant sounds.</s>
horse, haris, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Justification:
- The first word, "horse," contains the same consonant clusters ("es") as the second word, "haris."</s>
touro, terre, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "touro-terre" show consonance in the pattern of consonants at the end of each word. In this case, the "r" and the "e" are repeated, which creates a rhyming effect.</s>
settle, stille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "settle-stille" have consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or syllables, which creates a musical rhythm. In this case, both words end in the consonant "lle," resulting in a sense of rhythmic and musical cohesion between the words.</s>
amilia, muller, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
hammann, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do show consonance because both words share several common consonant sounds at the beginning and/or end of the words.</s>
treen, terrien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

The reason is that the two words are similar in the way they sound with many of the same consonant sounds (in this case, "r" and "n") being repeated. This consonance is an aural similarity where sounds or patterns are repeated which leads to a rhythmic effect in prosody.</s>
lechler, locally, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lechler-locally" show consonance.

This is because when you look closely at the words, you will find that there are 7 consecutive "l" and "c" sounds in the first word. These "l" and "c" sounds also appear in sequence in the second word, making consonance a visible feature in both words. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry, providing a sense of rhythm and continuity.</s>
curries, cause, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "curries" and "cause" show consonance. Both words feature the "cr" sound in their first and third elements (the letters 'r' in 'curries' and 'c' in 'cause'). This consonance is known as 'onomatopoeia' or echoic spelling.</s>
schiller, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schiller" and "ken" do show consonance. Both words contain the letter combination "sch" at the beginning, and both also share the 'll' sound within the word, known as a 'lyric' or 'lirik' consonance. This type of consonance can create a musical effect in language and can be an effective tool in poetry and song lyrics.</s>
elapse, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these two words exhibit consonance, both having /l/ and /s/ sounds in the middle of the word.</s>
locally, leclere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

In this case, the words "locally-leclere" exhibit consonance due to the repetition of the consonant sounds 'l' and 'r' at the end of the first three letters. This technique of using consonant repetition to create a poetic effect is known as consonance.</s>
melloan's, melons, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Explanation: In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds (including final consonants) in neighboring words or within a single word. In the phrase "melloan's-melons," the repeated 'l' sound in 'melloan' and 'melons' creates an effect of consonance. Consonance can enhance the alliteration, rhythmic patterns, and overall sound of a sentence, line, or phrase, contributing to the linguistic and artistic qualities of language.</s>
kuhn, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because both words have 'sh' and 'st' sounding consonants in the second and third syllables: 'kuhn' and 'castings.'

Words with strong consonant clusters can exhibit consonance, making them sound and rhyme more closely. In this case, 'kuhn' and 'castings' both contain 'sh' and 'st' sounds in the second or third syllables, which lend them a closer sound and rhyme.</s>
shiller, game, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. Both words have the same consonant sequence - "sh" - in the middle of the words.</s>
kaine, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

In the words "kaine" and "arseneau," the sequence of consonant sounds is "ky," "rs," and "n", which is present in both words. This pattern of consonant sounds gives them a similar sound and helps create rhyme scheme.</s>
ermer, maia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mermaia" contain consonant repetition as the sequence 'm-r-m' appears at the beginning of the words. The repetition of consonants can create a musical or pleasing effect in poetry and speech, often making them more memorable.</s>
curtis', cates, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
kuehne, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, there is consonance in the given word "kuehne-jimi".

Justification:
In linguistics, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in proximity to each other. The given word "kuehne-jimi" includes a repeating sequence of consonants (K, K, J, J) that are close to each other within the word itself. This makes the word show a pattern of consonance.</s>
brunty, aberrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In both words, the "r" sound is present multiple times within the first, internal syllables. This is known as the "rounded liquid" consonant, a sound that occurs in multiple languages and is represented by the symbols "r" or "w" in English. Additionally, it is important to note the presence of the "n" sound in both words and its role in linking the syllables together. Overall, the way the sounds "r," "n," "b," "a," "r," and "a" are all deployed in the given words indicates a form of consonance.</s>
coby, cab, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "coby-cab" have consonance. 

Consonance, a figure of speech involved with harmony in sounds between consonants or vowels, is present in those two words. Although they do not exactly have exact sonority, the vowel sounds /o/ present in both words create a similarity, thus creating a consonance effect. 

The presence of this quality of harmonious or near-harmonious sounds in a text, especially in poetry, is pleasing to the ear, as it helps create a rhythmic flow and an emotional appeal for the reader/listener.</s>
brethauer, broth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Justification: By definition, consonance refers to the repetition or near-repetition of consonant sounds in a sequence of words, especially in similar-looking, close-together words within a phrase or sentence.

In the provided words, "brethauer" and "broth", both words begin with the consonant sound of 'b' (pronounced as /b/).

The second words, 'broth', also uses the same consonant 'b', but this time it appears as the final sound of the word, which is still perceived as a relevant part of the consonance.

Both words share this 'b' sound, therefore they show consonance.</s>
lynd, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Here's why:
Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in a stressed syllable. In the phrase "lynd-olinde," there is only one syllable (lin-de) where the 'l' is pronounced. If you split the words into separate syllables "lynd" and "olinde," there are no instances of consonance. Therefore, the phrase doesn't show consonance.</s>
sent, sante, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of adjacent or nearby words. In the given pair of words "sent-sante," the letter 't' is only used once, and there is no consonant sound repeating at the end of the next word "sante." Therefore, it does not exhibit consonance.</s>
owades, doers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

In literary analysis, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words, often within the same line of verse or within a small group of words. In your example, the words "owades" and "doers" have a common ending sound (both end in -ead), which creates a pattern of consonant repetition that can contribute to the stylistic effect intended by the poet or author.</s>
laborer, allbee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words laborer-allbee show consonance.

The reason for the answer is that both words contain the same consonant sequence ("lr-") that appears multiple times in each word. This creates a pattern of similar-sounding consonant groups. This phenomenon is called consonance.</s>
ruyle, rollie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words exhibit consonance as both words start with the consonant sound 'r', followed by 'u' and 'l', respectively. Additionally, the syllables are rhythmically similar, maintaining a consistent pattern.</s>
knacks, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. They share similar consonant sounds at word endings: "n" in "knacks" and "ks" in "summerlin," which creates a pleasing sensation for the reader.</s>
sawed, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sawed-prima" do not demonstrate consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry, not between words. The reason "sawed-prima" does not show consonance is because none of the individual words in the phrase have the same repeating consonant sound. If we were to analyze the individual words 'sawed', 'saw', and 'prima', we will understand that 'sawed' has a [se] sound while 'saw' has a 's' sound and 'prima' has a [p] sound. Thus, each word does not share a similar consonant pattern, so it does not show consonance.</s>
fires, phase, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
zalay, zil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zalay-zil" do display consonance. The presence of clusters of consonant sounds (palatal consonants 'z' and 'l') in both words contributes to the overall consonance of the words.</s>
amoruso, immerse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance as "amoruso" and "immerse" both share the "rs" and "mm" consonant sounds, making the overall sound of the words slightly unusual and pleasing to the ear in a poetic context.</s>
rea, err, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance as both end in the same consonant sound "r".</s>
behalf, behof, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because the two words share the same consonant sounds in them. They are "behalf" and "behof" and they both contain the consonant sounds "b" and "f". The vowel sounds in the words are different, but the consonant sounds are the same.</s>
day's, owades, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "day's-owades" show consonance. 

These words share the "ay" sound in one of their words, indicating a consonant arrangement between them. Specifically, "da" in "days" mirrors "ow" in "owades." Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when multiple words within a sentence or stanza use the same vowel sounds or consonants. In the phrase "day's-owades," the "-ays" suffix of "days" and the "-ades" suffix of "owades" both share similar consonant patterns, which creates a strong effect of repetition.</s>
gertner, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gertner-keene" show consonance. 

A consonance is a literary device in poetry and prose, which refers to the repetition of a pattern of consonant sounds within a line of text (usually in the same syllable or word). In the word "gertner-keene," we can see that there are several repeated sounds, including both short and long vowel sounds. Furthermore, both words, despite being separated by a space, are pronounced very similarly (or even identically) to some extent when spoken aloud. Thus, it can be considered that both the words show a degree of consonance by having sound patterns that are closely related and create familiarity or echoes in the reader's ear when they are spoken or read.</s>
game, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No. 

Although these words share similar sounding consonant patterns, "game-roesner" does not quite fit the definition of consonance since it only has one instance of repeated consonants (in the -er ending). For consonance to occur in poetry, multiple words must have the same number of continuous consonant sounds. For example, in "game-roesner," "game" has two (-g-), "roesner" has three (-r-).</s>
sader, schaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these two words show consonance because both words contain the letters "s-a-d-e-r-s-c-h" in a row.

Consonance is a literary device that occurs when consecutive words share the same vowel sound after the first vowel, often resulting in a musical or rhythmic effect. In this case, both words start with "s," have a "d" in the second syllable, an "a" sound in the third syllable, a "r" sound in the fourth syllable, further maintaining a "s" in the fifth and sixth syllables. While it's true they don't have more consecutive vowel sounds, as that would be called assonance, they do share the same consonants. So the technique of "consonance" is still present in this case.</s>
tandy's, attends, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "tandy's-attends" do not show consonance, as there is no clear pattern of consonant sounds between the two words. The word "tandy's" has a "sh" sound, and the word "attends" has a "d" sound, which sound completely different. The two words are not related by their consonant sounds.</s>
sacred, scored, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

In this case, the consonance exists because both words contain four letter long sequences of consonants "cared" and "scored" in the words "sacred" and "scored." In particular, "sacred" has "cr-ed" and "scored" has "sr-ed". The repetition of these three letter long sequences between "sacred" and "scored" gives the words a similar shape or sound, which contributes to the overall consonance.</s>
smoot, summit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. Both words have a cluster of consonant sounds at the beginning, with "sm" in the first word and "sum" in the second word.</s>
schueler, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, in the given words "schueler-smolen", there is a combination of short and long vowels along with similar consonant sounds, resulting in what is known as consonance. Consonance occurs when a group of syllables in a line have a similar (usually consonant) sound. In this case, the repetition of the 'S' and 'C' sounds contributes to the overall consonant harmony of the words.</s>
koehne, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'koehne-gemma' show consonance because both words have the same consonant pattern, with 'k' and 'g' at the beginning of each word. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry, and in this case, both words share the same initial consonant sounds, making them an example of consonance.</s>
truett, outright, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a word or a stressed syllable in a series of words. In this case, both "truett" and "outright" share the consonant sounds /t/ and /r/. These occurrences create a rhythmic pattern and can contribute to the overall sound and rhyme scheme of a line of poetry.</s>
khomeini, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when the consonant sounds in one or more syllables of a word are similar to the consonant sounds in other syllables of that same word or neighboring words. In the case of "khomeini-reierson," there is no apparent consonance. The words have the same first sound (k), but that's the only similarity.</s>
zele, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance because both words, "zele-brion" and "sole-brion," share the sound of the "b" and "r" consonants in the center of the words.</s>
alcoa's, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "Alcoa's-braner" do show consonance, as both words end with the same vowel sound and have consonant clusters (cc) in the syllable onset (beginning) of their second words ("Alco" and "br"). This type of sound effect, known as consonance, can contribute to the rhythm and flow of a sentence or poetry.</s>
guertin, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance as both "guertin" and "kenney" have similar consonant sounds at the beginning of each word, i.e. 'G', 'K', and 'N'. This creates a pleasing musicality and rhythm in speech or writing.</s>
alco, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "alco-gemma" show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry or prose. In this case, the repetition of the "k" and "g" sounds gives the words a similar rhythm, which contributes to their overall effect.</s>
zil, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zil-khanna" show consonance. The 'zl' sequence at the beginning of each word has a similar sound to the 'lk' sequence in "zil-khanna." This shared consonant sound contributes to the consonance in the given words.</s>
zell, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

Consonance is identified when two or more words share the same consonant sounds within the same line or stanza of a poem. In the given words, 'zell' and 'conn', both letters 'c' and 'n' have been used within the words, hence they fall under the category of consonant sounds, leading to consonance between the words 'zell-conn'.</s>
gettin', multiprocessor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gettin'-multiprocessor" show consonance. 

In this case, the words "gettin'" and "processor" both begin with the consonant "g" and sound nearly identical when spoken. This creates a rhyme and a pattern, as they are pronounced similarly in this instance.</s>
hens, hanoi's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hens-hanoi's" show consonance.

This pattern of repeating consonant sounds is known as consonance. In "hens-hanoi's," there are two sets of consonant sounds, "hn" and "ai," repeated and connected by a hyphen. This creates a rhythmic and musical effect in the phrase, which contributes to the sound and overall meaning.</s>
garroz, gear's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words do show consonance. The consonance in "garroz-gear's" occurs when the consonant sounds (r and z) are repeated in close proximity:

- garroz-gear: The second syllable, "gear," contains the "r" that matches the "r" in "garroz."

- garb: The second syllable, "gear," is similar to "garb."

- garb-gear: The "r" in "garb" repeated in the second syllable "gear" creates the pattern of consonance.

- gear: This word, on its own, showcases consonance. The multiple "r" sounds create a rhythmic and repeated sound, which can make the word easier to remember or highlight certain elements.</s>
laack, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a word, phrase, or verse. In the given words "laack-smullen", there is no clear consonant sound that is repeated.

alcoa's, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The justification is that both words start with an "a," followed by a consonant (in "alcoa's" it's "l" and in "zeoli" it's "i") and then a vowel ("coa" and "oi") respectively. Additionally, they share a vowel sound at the end, which contributes to the similarity.</s>
tirey, terre, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Explanation: In the words "tirey-terre," the repeated "y-t" consonant sequence occurs twice, which creates a pattern of similar consonant sounds. This phenomenon of similar consonant sounds occurring in proximity is known as consonance.</s>
o'connor, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds in the same line or stanza, usually in the same language. In the given words "o'connor-brun," both words end with similar consonant sounds - "on" and "run." However, the other consonants in the words do not create any matching patterns. Consequently, the phrase does not demonstrate consonance in a language-dependent manner.</s>
liebe, allbee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the two words "liebe" and "allbee" show consonance, as they both have the "l" and "e" sounds followed by the "b" sound in the second syllable. This creates a consistent sound pattern with the syllables sharing two letters and ending with a similar set of vowel sounds.</s>

These words show consonance because the consonant sounds between the target word and the replacement word are the same. In this case, "alcoa's" has the same consonant sounds as "nex".</s>
soeder, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of separated words or within the same word. In the phrase "soeder-litigating," there is no clear pattern or significant repetition of consonant sounds to be considered consonance. However, the words "soeder" and "litigating" themselves are words with consonance due to the repetition of the consonant 'r' sound at the end of each word. But when the words are combined as one phrase, there is no apparent consonance. Therefore, the overall phrase does not demonstrate consonance in the way that individual words within it might.</s>
noxso, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
rosenow, rosanne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'rosenow' and 'rosanne' do show consonance because both possess the same consonants in the same order ('-son-' in 'rosenow' and '-an-' in 'rosanne').</s>
platz, palazzi, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance is a poetic technique where words with similar consonant sounds are used in close succession to create a musical effect. In the case of "platz-palazzi," the only common consonant is "z," which doesn't create a consistent or interesting pattern when read out loud. It's similar to the words "place" and "places," but it lacks the characteristic repetition that makes consonance work effectively.</s>
canny, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "canny-priam" shows consonance, as both words share the "n" and "r" sounds at the end of the word. Consonance is a poetic device in which the repetition of consecutive consonant sounds is used for emphasis or musical effect.</s>

avalon's, villines, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "avalon's-villines" show consonance.

Consonance is a literary device where consecutive consonant sounds are repeated within a line of verse. The word "avalon's" already contains a consonant sound, and by adding the word "villines," the last vowel sound in "avalon's" is repeated, creating a rhythmic pattern that uses adjacent sounds from the previous word to create a flow. The repetition of the "l" sound serves as an example of a literary technique often used in poetry or songs to create a sense of musicality or rhythm.</s>
scour, scarry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "scour-scarry" show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within words. In these words, you can notice that the "r" sound is repeated as a consonant. Thus, despite the different meanings of the words, they share the same aspect of sound consonance, making them show consonance.</s>
hymen, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to a recurring sound between consonants: for example, "beautiful" and "secluded" feature a rhyme on the word "beauty" where the /t/ and /a/ sounds are repeated. "Hymen-kain" has no such recurring sound between consonants that would indicate consonance.

Hence, the given words display no recognizable consonant sounds, they merely have the same first consonant, "h," so they do not demonstrate the criteria of consonance.</s>
necks, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schuller, goyim, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes.

This connection between letters that produce the same sound or "consonant cluster" in the words contributes to the consonance present.</s>
sidi, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. In the phrase "sidi-roesner", the consecutive vowels 'i' and 'e' are adjacent to similar consonant sounds ('s' and 'r'). This is a typical example of consonance, where two adjacent words contain the same consonant sounds in succession.</s>
toyed, tad, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance is a poetic technique in which the repetition of consonant sounds is done. Here, the words "toyed-tad" contain a repeated "t" sound, which fits the definition of consonance. However, there are no other consonant sounds within these two words. To meet the requirement of consonance, the words "toyed-tad" would have to be part of a longer phrase, such as "wagged-tad" or "swum-toyed-tad," where "toyed" is followed by "tad." In this case, the consonant sounds in the second word create a consonance between the two words, hence "toyed-tad" would show consonance in a sentence context.</s>
paonessa, ponce, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because they share the sound of two pairs of consonants, "pn" and "sp".</s>
tomatoe, timeout, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these two words show consonance as both words start and end with the same consonant sound: "t".

kahle, cally, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kahle-cally" exhibit consonance.

Consonance is a poetic device that focuses on similar or consonant sounds in a sequence of words, often within the same line of verse. In this case, the consonant sounds occur with the repetition of the "l" and "y" sounds in the words "kahle" and "cally." This results in a musical effect that contributes to the rhythm and overall sound of the phrase.

In contrast, another notable characteristic of the word usage is the blending of two words that create a neologism -- "kahle" is a made-up word or a compound word that seems to be based on common words and syllables, often with unique meanings. In this case, "kahle" might be a variation of "caly," as it is formed from merging the words "care" and "play."

Furthermore, the hyphen in "kahle-cally" helps separate the two words, demonstrating that they are related and may carry similar connotations or meanings. Overall, the inclusion of consonant sounds and the blending of distinct words characterise the words "kahle-cally" as exhibiting consonance. Thus, the correct answer is: Yes, the words "kahle-cally" exhibit consonance.</s>

Justification:
Consonance can be understood as the repetition of the same consonant sound at the end of words in a phrase or sentence. In these words, there is a continuous sequence of [oel] and [wn] sound that lasts through both words. Thus, it can be considered as consonance between the two words. However, it is important to note that if we focus on just the [oel] sound or just the [wn] sound, the consonance could count as two separate instances (consonance in 'oel' and consonance in 'wn'), or as one instance of consonance that encompasses the entirety of both words.</s>
leiby, lob, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because they both share a consonant sound at the beginning of the word (L).

Both "leiby-lob" and "consonance" have the letter 'L' at the beginning, which creates a similar sound and contributes to the overall rhythm or pattern created by the consonant sounds in these words. This is a common characteristic in poetry and helps create a distinctive and harmonious sound within a text, commonly known as consonance.</s>

Words like "guertin-knacks" do not meet this criteria because they create a sequence of two distinct words separated by a hyphen instead of an ensuing consonantal pattern.</s>
petrilli, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance:

In the given word pair "petrilli-bruner," the '-l-' sound occurs in both words, which creates consonance. Consonance is a figure of speech where two or more words have the same consonant sounds in them. In this case, the '-l-' sound is shared between these two words.</s>
pennisi, ponce, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because both words have the same consonant sounds in the endings -ci and -ce.

In the word "pennisi," the consonant "s" is the same as in the word "ponce," which makes "s" the consonant shared at the end of both words.</s>
kenna, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. Both "kenna" and "bruney" have clusters of consonant sounds at the ends of their words: "nn" in "kenna" and "ney" in "bruney." This characteristic of having multiple consonants in a sequence is known as internal rhyme or consonance.</s>

tyke, atek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schlee, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

Consonance refers to the recurrence of consonant sounds in a sequence, and both "schlee" and "alcoa" exhibit this pattern. The repetition of the "sch" sound between "s" and "ch" in "schlee" and the "ch" sound before the "a" in "alcoa" are examples of consonance.</s>
depaola, oedipal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance with OE (Old English) roots, which typically end in a consonant. The words 'depaola' and 'oedipal' both possess this consonant in the end, which contributes to consonance in terms of OE linguistics.</s>
kan, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because "kan" and "bro" (from "Borneo") share the same beginning consonant sound. Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in consecutive or nearby words, which can create a pleasing aural effect in literature.</s>
astley, stille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "astley" and "stille" show consonance. 

Consonance occurs when the same consonant sound is repeated at the end of words or within words. In this case, both words have the "ly" consonant sound at the end. Therefore, both "astley" and "stille" exhibit consonance.</s>
petralia, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "petralia-incase" show consonance, but it is not perfect. 

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the end or beginning of words, or in the middle of words. Here, the words "petralia" and "incase" have the same consonant 'c', which is the only instance of consonance in the given pair. The words do not have many other repeated consonants. Additionally, the word "petralia" appears in both words and does not contribute to the specific consonance pattern in "incase".

In this case, it is not completely perfect consonance, but the repetition of the 'c' sound creates some similarity between the two words, which is a defining characteristic of consonance.</s>
shaul, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance because there are no matching consonants or consonant clusters in the provided words.</s>
souder, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In this case, the structure of the words features multiple repeating consonant sounds. "Souder" has the consonants "s-u-o-d-e-r" that repeat twice, while "brony" has the consonants "b-r-o-n-y" that repeat as well. Therefore, the words demonstrate a consonant-based repetition, which is a defining characteristic of consonance.</s>
breth, broth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, this pair of words exhibit consonance. The reason why I can conclude this is because the vowel sound in both syllables are the same (the "e" sound). If you notice, both the first and last letters of both words have the same consonant sound. So essentially, we have the same consonant sound repeated, which indicates a degree of consonance between the two words ("breth" and "broth"). It's not necessarily the same kind of consonance as if the consonants had been placed next to each other, but it still indicates a level of consonance, albeit a slightly different type.</s>
schoeller, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance, as both words share the same letters 'o', 'l' and 'e', which are the repeated consonant sounds. The words "Schoeller-Smolen" and "Schoeller-Smolenism" display consonance as repeating a combination of consonant sounds throughout the respective words.</s>
stork, sitrick, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not show consonance because they only share the consonant "k" in the final syllables. In consonance, at least two syllables in a word or poem should share the same consonant pattern from the beginning of the syllable to the stress, and not just at the end. Here, while both words share a single consonant "k", they don't align consonant patterns in a way that would create consonance.</s>
tidy, tad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. Both words contain the letters "ti" and "da," which create the same segmented sound. Consonance occurs when a literary work has the repetition of consonant sounds within a line or sometimes throughout the poem.</s>

strep, streep, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In the given words "strep-streep," there are several examples of consonance between the vowel sounds. Both words begin with the sound /s/, followed by the same vowel sound /ɪ/, which is the beginning sound of "it" in both the words. In addition, the final consonant sound is /p/, which is present at the ends of both words. This pattern of sound repetition is what is referred to as consonance in poetry and literature.</s>
saudi, aachener, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance between them.

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words in the same line of poetry.

Therefore, these two words do not show consonance.</s>
dolley, idle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "dolley-idle" shows consonance because it has a pattern of same consonant sound at the end of each word which gives a smooth and melodic effect. Consonance is a literary device that occurs when two or more words in a phrase, sentence, or stanza have the same or similar consonant sound at the end of the word. So, we can see that ending "ey" sound makes a consonant connection in the word, which gives the phrase an overall feeling of rhythm and musicality.</s>
coone, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "coone-jama" show consonance, as the internal clusters of consonant sounds (CVC) are the same between the two words: /kɔnɪne/ and /dʒɛmə/. These internal consonant sounds provide a linking characteristic between the words that contributes to consonance.</s>
ares, ours, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance is a literary device where like consonant sounds are found at the end of words, within a phrase or a line of poetry. In "ares-ours", the only consonant sound that appears is the 's' in "ores". All other letters do not create any consonant sound. Therefore, these words do not show consonance.</s>
kuhne, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kuhne-arseneau" show consonance due to the presence of the consonant clusters "kh" and "sh." Consonance refers to the repetition of similar consonant sounds in words. In this case, both words start with "kh" followed by "sh," and the other letters and sounds in the words are different. This makes the words not identical but still exhibit consonance.</s>

boat's, butzer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of the same consonant sounds in adjacent words or within the same word. In the words "boat's-Butzer", the only consonant sound is the "t" in "boat's". There are no other consonants to be repeated, which is why the words do not show consonance.</s>
he, houy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words seem to show consonance. The pattern of consonant repetition in the word "he-houy" can be seen as follows:

1. he (voiceless velar plosive)
2. he (voiceless velar plosive [sounds like 'h'])
3. - (no phonetic element)
4. u (voiced alveolar fricative)
5. y (voiced alveolar fricative)

The consecutive consonant sounds in "he-hou" are all different, but the repetition of the "h" sound is where the consonance can be found. The word still works phonetically, and it might be used in a poetry context to emphasize the sound pattern rather than meaning.</s>
solder, shelly, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words, within words, or in groups of words.

There is no identical consonant sound or common consonants repeating near each other in these words.</s>
pfohl, flour, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "pfohl-flour" show consonance because both words begin with the consonant "p". Consonance is the repetition of a consonant sound at the beginning or end of a word or at the beginning of two or more consecutive words.</s>
sheilah, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Justification: The words "Sheilah-Germer" have no clearly matching consonants between the two words. While they both contain the letter 'h', the remaining letters are dissimilar. In consonance, words with similar or repeated consonants are often paired, hence, they are considered "matched". Thus, "Sheilah-Germer" do not possess any of the defining characteristics of word pairs that show consonance.</s>
ikon, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance because both words end with consecutive consonant sounds (i and r in "ikon" and "ireson").</s>
brust, braced, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance as they both have the letters "brust-" and "braced" which are repeated in words. This phenomenon, also referred to as consonance, helps create an auditory musicality within the words.</s>
leaps, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words do not show consonance.

In the words "leaps" and "lips," while there are some similarities in the spelling (both having "p" and "s" letters), the actual sounds are different. The word "leaps" is pronounced with a short e sound as in "bet," while the word "lips" is pronounced with an i sound as in "dips." Consonance is when there is a repetition of the same consonant sound within words, and the presence of similar letters in the spelling does not guarantee or imply consonance in the pronunciation.</s>
schaal, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schaal-hannam" demonstrate consonance. In this case, both words contain the same consonant sounds at the end, specifically "schaal" and "hannam." This creates a pleasing rhythm and can help create a poetic or musical effect in writing.</s>

bowron, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

The words "bowron-germe" do not exhibit consonance because the consonants in each word are out of place. In "bowron," the consonants in each syllable are: [b w r n]. However, in "germe," the consonants in each syllable are: [g r m ]. The consonants in "germe" do not match the corresponding consonants in "bowron", so these words do not show any consonance.</s>
hah, howey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. Both words, "hah" and "howey," have the same repeating consonant sound, which is the "h" sound.

In the word "hah," the "h" is pronounced at the beginning of the word, while in "howey," it appears in the middle of the word. However, the consonant sound "h" is still present in both cases, and that's what makes them consonant words.</s>
ruyle, orel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words "ruyle-orel" show consonance. It is because there is a "ly" sound followed by a voiceless consonant sound, such as in "rule" (r-u-l-e) and "ore" (o-r-e). Consonance is a literary device where the repetition of consonant sounds can be used to create a musical rhythm in a text.</s>
guyton, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

In this case, the word "guyton" in both parts of the consonant words shares the same sounding out group of letters. The first letter of each word makes a short sound or a consonant, followed by three vowels, forming a regular pattern. The pattern (short consonant followed by three vowels) gives a sense of similarity in pronunciation and can be seen as a form of consonance between the words. So both words "guyton-zeal" contain a consonance, although just a simple one.</s>
schaal, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
tsuda, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The words "tsuda-noxso" (Japanese: つだのックソ) use a pattern of repetitive consonant sounds at the end of the words (つだ - ックソ). This repetition of sounds creates a strong bond between the two words, giving them a musical quality and making them similar in structure.</s>
oelkers, hyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oelkers-hyman" show consonance.

I determined this by analyzing the letters in the two words. "Oelkers" and "Hyman" both have many letters that are the same in the two words. It's essential to note that they're not spelled exactly the same, but it's common practice to count these as having partial consonance.

While consonance doesn't necessarily mean the words should rhyme, it does involve letters being repeated within a word or across words. So, in this context, "oelkers" and "hyman" have partial consonance as they share multiple consonant letters: "o", "e", "l", "k", "s", "h", and "m".</s>
sighed, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "sighed-kanne" shows consonance in the repetition of the consonant "n" at the end of each word. Consonance is a poetic technique where consecutive vowel sounds are followed by the same consonant sound. In this case, "sigh-d" and "kan-n-e" share the "n" sound.</s>
health, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "health" and "bruney" do show consonance, as they both have three letters and have consecutive consonant sounds: /h/ /pl/ /b/ /r/ /n/ /y/ . In this case, the /h/, /p/, and /r/ sounds are present in each word in different forms (the h in "health" and "bruney," and the fricative p in "bruney").</s>
cede, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cede-hamann" show consonance because of the repeating "c" sound at the beginning and the "n" sound at the end. It is a common form of sound play called alliteration, where two or more words share the same initial sound.</s>
easily, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "easily-germer" show consonance. 

In this word pair, the 's' and 'm' sounds are both short and clear, making them similar in pronunciation. The '-ly' syllable in 'easily' also adds to the consonance by helping to connect the two words. The result is a pleasant and harmonious rhyme between the two words. The consonance helps maintain a sense of balance in the phrase, adding to its overall appeal.</s>
silsby, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "silsby-sterilizations" show consonance, as they share the identical consonant pattern "sILsBYs-SteRilISaTIONs."</s>
haggart, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "haggart" and "kian" show consonance, as they both have consecutive consonant sounds "gh" in the first word and "k" in the second word.</s>
zel, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

After analyzing the words "zel-litigating," the repeated letter "l" (in "litigating") serves as a consonant that is also present in both words. This repetition of consonants is a common characteristic of consonance.

Furthermore, the first syllable of each word, which begins with "zel-," contains the same sequence of consonants: "z-l" in the first word and "z-" in the second. This further emphasizes the consonance present in the words.</s>
tsuda, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "tsuda-jam" do show consonance. 

Consonance is a figure of speech that creates a rhythmic effect by repetition of consonant sounds at the ends of words or syllables. Here, the end of the word "tsuda" (sutta) is repeated as "da-jam," and consonant 'd' in both words creates a rhythmic effect.</s>
lotto, laity, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance is a rhetorical device where similar consonant sounds are used immediately following each other in a line of text. In this case, there are no similar consonant sounds in the given words "lotto-laity." The words "lotto" and "laity" have different vowel sounds and do not relate each other by repeating the same consonant sounds.</s>
cally, kiehl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance. 

In the given words - cally-kiehl, there are a few instances of consonant clusters or similar consonant sounds. The '-c' consonant sound is repeated in both words, and the word 'kiehl' begins with 'k', which appears in 'cally'. Although the words do not share all of the same consonants (different consonants at the beginning and ending), there is still a level of consonant similarity within the two words. This gives them a certain structural similarities, which can contribute to a sense of rhythm and rhyme in the context of poetry or spoken language.</s>
side, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
herminie, huguet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "herminie-huguet" show consonance as they share the consonant 't' in the second and third syllables. This contributes to the pattern and phonetic similarity of the words.</s>
luk, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "luk-jaimie" shows consonance because both words have matching consecutive consonants: "l-u-k" in the first word, and "j-a-i-m-i-e" in the second word.</s>
balzer, bylaws, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when there is a repetition of consonant sounds at the end of near-rhyming words with the same vowel sound, as in "balzer-bylaws." In this case, there is no common consonant sound at the end of the words; the vowels are different, and the only similarity is in the word "balzer," which shares the same consonant sound with the prefix but does not produce the desired effect of consonance.</s>
seader, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. 

In this case, both words contain letter sequences of similar pronunciation:
- "seader" has the consonant sequence "s-d-r"
- "bahraini" has the consonant sequence "b-h-r-n-i"</s>
keene, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "keene" and "braner" exhibit consonance, as both words start with the same consonant "k".

Consonance refers to the repetition of a particular consonant sound within words or phrases. In this case, both "keene" and "braner" start with the same "k" sound, demonstrating a pattern of consonant repetition. This instance showcases consonance in language and adds a unique rhythmic effect to the words.</s>
divi, davao, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
hammann, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

In this case, both words are using the same consonants (MNNC) multiple times in a row. This pattern is known as consonance and creates a more musical rhythm within the phrase.</s>
shaul, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shaul-rosene" show consonance because they contain the same consonant pattern "sh" at the beginning of the second word.</s>
bachmeier, beckum, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bachmeier-beckum" show consonance, as they both have seven consonant letters: B-A-C-H-M-E-I-E-R. This pattern gives a musical quality to the phrase.</s>
pols, ploys, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "pols-ploys" show consonance because both words share the same consonant sounds at the beginning: "p" in both words.</s>
patrol, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because both the words "patrol" and "prem" have the same consonant sounds: 'p' and 'r'. This type of parallelism is known as consonance.</s>
shelly, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words do show consonance.

There is a pattern of consonant sounds between the two words "shelly-lookers." Both words contain the letter "sh" and "oo" as a vowel sound. The repetition of consonant sounds can create a sense of unity and create a musical quality to the language.</s>
easily, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. The justification is that both words have the initial sound of /r/ in "easily" and "rossin", and this onset sounds match up, creating a repetition of consonant sounds.</s>
gear's, gruis, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds (usually the same or similar sounds) in close proximity to each other, usually at the end of words within a line or phrase. In the phrase "gear's-gruis," there is only one instance where two adjacent words end in similar consonance (in this case, the "r" sound). Therefore, these words do not show a significant case of consonance.</s>
ebright, bret, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because both words have the consonant sounds "B-R" in the same order. Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when two or more words have the same or similar consonant sounds without vowel syllables in between.</s>
rea, irey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "rea-irey" show consonance as both words end with the same two consonants (re, i, and ey). This is an example of how consonance can be used to create a certain musicality or rhythm in language.</s>
loco, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In the words "loco-jam," the 'c' sound is paired with the 'o' sound, and the 'j' sound is paired with the 'm' sound, creating a repetition of consonant sounds. This pattern is known as consonance.</s>
nyx, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not show consonance because the vowel sounds in both words ("nyx" and "jemmie") are not consistently repeated or shared across the words. The only common consonant is "x" in "nyx", but that's not enough to establish consonance.</s>
curtis', eckert's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words show no consonance.

Justification: The words "curtis'-eckert's" do not share any consonant sounds between them. The word "curtis-" ends with a hyphen that was accidentally left in, and the suffix "-eckert" has different vowel sounds and no consonants in immediate proximity. This makes it an atypical arrangement of consonants that would ordinarily be found in harmony or balance. However, "curtis'-eckert's" does not show actual consonant harmony, and hence would not be considered as showcasing consonance.

The term "consonance" generally refers to the rhyming of word endings, as you have in the phrase "rain and thine" from a famous sonnet by poet William Shakespeare. But in "curtis'-eckert's", while there is some consonance with the final dash and the "eckert", with the hyphen and the ending of the suffix, it is of the "internal" kind, which is not what we're generally looking for when we say 'consonance'. However, even that's arguable, as the dash and the 't' are not quite the same thing, and the suffix 'eckert' has its own vowel and consonant characters, so there are indeed vowels and consonants here, but nothing in particular that seems to connect with a typical 'consonance' in the sense of words with consonants next to each other. The consonants here serve the semantic function
petrelli, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "petrelli" and "boren" show consonance due to their repetition of consonant sounds. In this instance, "p" and "b" are the repeated consonant sounds.</s>
kearny, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kearny" and "prom" exhibit consonance as they both have the sound of "K" and "P" in their corresponding positions.</s>
schueler, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, there is consonance between the words "schueler" and "kain". The "ch" sound is shared in both words, which creates a rhythmic or musical quality that can produce a pleasing sound. This is an instance of consonance, which is a literary technique where a pattern of sounds within a text is emphasized to achieve a certain effect.</s>
bleck, bilk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bleck-bilk" show consonance because they both have a pattern of similar or identical consonant sounds at the end of the word, which creates a musical rhythm.

Bleck-bilk consists of two words, "bleck" and "bilk." Both parts of the word have /bl/ or /b/ sounds, so the word features consistent bl series of consonant sounds at the end. This creates a consonant-rich pattern that contributes to the overall sound of the word.</s>
zaley, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zaley-obryan" show consonance. 

Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or near the end of syllables. In "zaley-obryan," the "l" and "n" sounds are repeated in the last syllable of each word, creating a sense of smoothness and rhythm. This wordplay contributes to the overall sound and rhythm of the phrase, which might add to the poem or text's overall meaning.</s>
olokuei's, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. 

Consonance occurs when there is a pattern of similar consonant sounds between words. In this case, each of the individual words 'olokei's' and 'highman' consists of three syllables, and there is no clear consonant pattern in their spelling to indicate consonance.</s>
pralle, pirelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "pralle-pirelli" show consonance.

The reason is that both words contain a series of two or more consonants that are pronounced with the same sounds. In this case:

- 'pralle' vibrates [pra-la-luj] with the 're' and 'lle' both starting with a similar 'pr' phoneme, and
- 'pirelli' vibrates [pee-rehl-ee] with the 're' and 'il' both starting with a similar 'er' phoneme.

Consonance is a rhyme based on the similar sounding consonants, either at the end of a word or in between vowels. Hence, in both these words, 'p' and 'r' in 'pralle' and 'pr' in 'pirelli' are repeated and are pronounced with the same vibration, making these words show consonance.</s>
utt, eight, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "utt-eight" do not show consonance. 

Consonance is a rhetorical device where two or more letters of the same kind are repeated in quick succession, helping to emphasize certain words in a poem, song or other literature. 

In "utt-eight," the vowel is repeated "eight," but the repetition of the other letters "tt" doesn't create a pattern of consonance. Therefore, these words don't possess the quality of consonance. They simply lack a pattern by repeating t and nothing else.</s>
lindy, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

Consonance means repetition of the same consonant sounds at the end of words or syllables within a given chunk of text. The words "lindy-olinde" do not have any consonant sounds that repeat in the same way, making the words non-consonant-ful (also known as rime-less in terms of linguistic terminology).</s>
hany, hano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do show consonance. The word pair "hany-hano" demonstrates a pattern of similar consonant sounds at the beginning of the words. 

Consonance is a figure of speech in which the same consonant sound begins each of a series of words, phrases, or sentences. In this example, the repeated "h" sound in both words demonstrates consonance. This technique helps emphasize certain words, create rhythm or rhyme, and create literary devices like alliteration.</s>
keen, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.</s>
cuccio, katcher, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do show consonance because they both share the consonant sounds "ss" and "ch" in the root of the words. Consonance is a literary device that brings two words or phrases closer in a way that emphasizes the consonant sounds of their individual components, suggesting a kind of musical effect. This type of poetic technique can help to set a rhythm and rhyme, allowing words to "sing" together on the reader's tongue.</s>
aken, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Justification: The words "aken" and "jamb" both have a "-k-" sounding consonant at the beginning, and the "-n-" and "-m-" sounds respectively at the end. Although the sounds do not exactly match, they are both relatively close in pronunciation, which is a characteristic of consonance in poetry.</s>
mealy, muller, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because both words contain the same consecutive consonant sounds - 'mm' in "mealy-muller." Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when words with similar consonant clusters are used in close proximity to each other. This technique is used to draw attention to specific sounds and emphasize them within a sentence or poem.</s>
astra, storey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "astra-storey" show consonance. The '-str-' sound is repeated in the second and third syllables of each word, highlighting the shared consonant sounds.</s>
hermann, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

The words "hermann-bowron" contain three consecutive consonants in the middle of the spelling: "her-man-bow-ron." This pattern of two vowels in a row followed by three consonants, known as consonance, can result in a rhythmic quality that tends to make phrases or lines sound similar in pronunciation or emphasis.</s>
gokey, gocke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gokey-gocke" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds at the end of words or within words. In this case, the word "gokey" shares the same vowel sound at the end ("key"), and the word "gocke" has its "ke" ending repeated. Although not strictly in the same word, the repetition of "cke" at the end of "gocke" adds to the consonant repetition, resulting in consonance in both words.</s>
linus, linsay, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not show consonance because they have no pair of corresponding consonant sounds that appear together in a word. In the words "linus" and "linsay," only the initial consonant, "l," appears in both words. The other consonant sounds are different. Consonance requires two words or sounds to have at least one consonant in common, and in this case, there are no shared consonant sounds.</s>
kelker, kloc, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
argent, reagent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech that occurs when two or more words in a series have the same or similar consonant sounds at the beginning of syllables within the same line of poetry or speech. In this case, "argent-reagent" shares the same consonant sound [a] at the beginning of both words ("argent" and "reagent"). Therefore, these words exhibit consonance.</s>
grue, gore, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "grue-gore" show consonance.

In poetry or literature, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in close proximity. In this case, both "grue" and "gore" end with the same consonant, which gives the word pairs a rhythmic effect and can create a pleasing sensation for the reader's ear.</s>
leclere, lukoil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "leclere-lukoil" show consonance.

In this case, consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in nearby or adjacent letters within a string of words. In the phrase "leclere-lukoil," we see that both words share the same initial consonant sound "l" and later consonant sounds "ee," "oo," and "ul." This creates a rhythm and similarity in pronunciation, giving the phrase a distinctive and recognizable appearance and sound.</s>
sundai, sandy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sundai-sandy" show consonance. 

Consonance is a figure of speech where consecutive words have the same or similar consonant sounds at the end of words. In this case, both words have the "nd" sound at the end, which qualifies as consonance.</s>
sawdey, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sawdey" and "lookers" show consonance. This literary technique involves using words with similar or matching consonant sounds, such as "s" and "l" in both words. The consonance creates a musical effect within the sentence and contributes to the overall rhythm and flow of the language.</s>
sawed, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. The words "sawed" and "kisling" have no clear consonant sounds to match and thus do not exhibit consonance.</s>
khomeini, egerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "khomeini-egerton" show consonance, as both words begin with the consonant "k" and end with the consonant "t". However, the reason for giving "Yes" is that this phenomenon of sound repetition (consonance) is based on specific phonetics and not necessarily limited to word meanings or other more complex linguistic conventions.</s>
strnad, ascertained, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the consonants in the words are similar:

"strnad" and "ascertained" both contain the csonant clusters "st," "cr," "sn," and "d" in various positions.</s>
koon, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "koon-brun" show consonance. Both words have the consonant "k" on the first syllable, which contributes to the repetition of the same consonant sound within the two words.</s>
agner, eagen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "agner-eagen" show consonance. Consonance occurs when multiple lines of poetry have similar consonant sounds at the end of words or within words. In this case, the letters "g" and "n" occur in a similar pattern at the end of each word, contributing to the consonance between them.</s>
opus, oops, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance occurs when multiple words in a line or passage of a poem feature the same or near-similar consonant sound at the end of their syllables. In the given example, "opus-oops," although both words contain the letter "o" at the end of the second syllable, the words do not share consonant sounds other than the "o" at the ending.</s>
baran, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech where consonant sounds repeated in words close together (or in quick succession). In the words "baran" and "geremia," both words share the same consonant sounds: 'b' and 'g.' The similarity in consonant sounds creates a pleasing and rhythmic effect in the word pairing, which makes these words show consonance.</s>
lucca, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lucca-elcotel" show consonance because the final consonant ("l" in "lucca" and "c" in "elcotel") is the same.</s>
coiner, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "coiner-priam" do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds in the same line of poetry or prose. In the words "coiner-priam," only the letter 'r' and "am" at the end make a brief consonance. The rest of the words do not share any consonant sounds, so they cannot be considered as showing consonance.</s>
elopes, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance in the pattern of letters "l" that appear in both words. The word "elopes" contains two 'l's, while the word "lips" contains three 'l's, creating a consonant sequence that can be perceived as pleasingly repetitive or synchronous in these words.</s>
summor's, semis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "summor's-semis" do show consonance. This can be justified by analyzing the repetition of consonant sounds in the words. "Summors" has the same 'm' and 's' sounds as "summors,' and the 's-' combination creates another 's' sound. The term 'semis' also has a 's' sound, creating the pattern. So, the repetition of these sounds creates the consonance effect in the given words.</s>
apec, pokey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "apec-pokey" show consonance in the first segment of the word ("apec") where there are consecutive consonant sounds. The first two letters "a" and "p" are both vowels, but the next two consonant letters, "e" and "c" create a pattern of consonant sounds, which is a common feature in consonance.</s>
maids', murders, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "maids-murders" show consonance.

Consonance is a figure of speech where a series of similar consonant sounds are repeated in close proximity in the same line of poetry. In this case, the sequence "ma-mur-ders" consists of three successive consonant sounds (M, M, and R). While the two parts "maids" and "murders" do not necessarily have the same spelling, they both consist of the same repeated consonant sound series of "ma-mur," which fits the definition of consonance.</s>
schmehl, shimel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words exhibit consonance. 

Consonance involves the repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry. In the words "schmehl" and "shimel," the "l" sounds are consonant sounds that are repeated.</s>
sowata, esty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance as there are repeating consonant sounds among them. In this case, "s" and "t" are repeated in both words, creating the effect of consonance.</s>
tomato, timeout, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "tomato" and "timeout" show consonance because they both have the letters "tmto" in both words, which create a pattern of similar consonant sounds throughout the words.</s>
storti, streett, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "storti-streett" do show consonance, as they both feature the same consonant sounds ("ss" in "storti" and "tt" in "streett"). Consonance occurs when two or more words in a sequence have the same or similar consonant sounds. In this case, both instances of "t" and "s" are the same or sound similar enough for them to qualify as consonance.</s>
gitano, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gitano-brion" show consonance. The first word, "gitano," contains the consonant pattern "ggt-n-," while "brion" has the pattern "b-r-n-." Both patterns contain the same three consonants in a row, which creates a pattern of consonance.</s>
dover, davey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dover-davey" show consonance.

Justification: The words "dover-davey" contain a shared consonant, which is the "v" sound. Both words end with the "v" sound and have similar consonant patterns within the words. This is why the words can be considered an example of consonance.</s>
solder, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "solder-jama" show consonance.</s>
leaps, lopes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance as they both have two or more letters at the end of the words that match at the end (in this case, "ps" and "ps"). Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds and can create a musical effect in poetry or language.</s>
berber, baba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "berber-baba" show consonance as both words contain repeated consonant sounds in a manner similar to anaphora. In both words the '-b' and '-r' consonant sounds are found with a syllable break between "ber" and "berber" in the first word and between "baba" and "b" in the second.</s>
ivory, yves, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

Justification: In the given words "ivory-yves," the word pairs are "ivory" and "yves," where the two main letters 'o' and 'r' are repeated to a certain degree. Such recurring letters are termed as consonance, as their repetition creates a similar effect.</s>
hert, hiott, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'hert-hiott' show consonance.

In this case, the words 'hert-hiott' exhibit consonance because both words have the same consonant sounds (the "t" sound in both "hert" and "iott"). Consonance is a poetic technique where the same or similar consonant sounds are used in adjacent or closely related words. In this example, the "t" sound in "hert" and "iott" is the same and it occurs adjacent to another "t" sound, creating consonance.</s>
quito, ector, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words "quito-ector" show consonance, as they share the same final consonant sounds ("tt" in "quito" and "ttor" in "ector"). Consonance refers to the repetition of the same consonant sound at the end of words or within words, making a particular effect in sound and rhythm of the text.</s>
scour, screw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "scour-screw" exhibit consonance. Consonance is a figure of speech where a repetition of a consonant sound is employed, usually at the end or beginning of words to create a rhythmic effect. In this case, the "u" sound at the end of "scour" and the beginning of "screw" reinforce the syllable stress, leading to a stronger and more pronounced consonance. The overall effect of such a repetition is to provide rhythm and an engaging, musical qualities to the language.</s>
husky, hasek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'husky-hasek' show consonance. This is because the sequence of consonant sounds ("hh" and "kk") in the word 'husky' is repeated in the word 'hasek', creating a similarity in the consonant sounds. This is one of the characteristics often associated with consonance.</s>
sidey, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance.

These words, "sidey-litigating" have no consonant sounds in the coda position (the position that immediately follows the consonant in the syllable), it lacks onsets (sounds at the beginning of the syllable) and has only a single consonant 't' at the end/onset. Therefore, it does not qualify as having consenanance. 'Side' -is followed by 'litigating', which is the first syllable of this word. This is also an example of polysyllabic words which could have various number of onsets and codas.</s>
schuller, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not show consonance. Consonance is the repetition of consonant sounds. In the words "schuller-gemma," there are no consonant sounds repeated. Consonant sounds can be both single consonants or clusters of multiple consonants. In this phrase, only vowel sounds repeat, which is not the characteristic of consonance.</s>
egert, gotta, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "egert" and "gotta" do not show consonance.

Consonance occurs when there is a repetition of consonant sounds within a line of poetry at the end of words or syllables. In these words, 'E' and 'T' are consonant sounds, but they don't repeat in the same line of poetry. Consonance can be seen in words like "better" or "rather" but not in words with no clear consonant sound repetition, such as "egert" and "gotta".</s>
haggart, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "haggart-jammu" show consonance.

When comparing the words, we can see that both words have the consonant pattern "hg-m," i.e., they both start with the same two consonants. This type of pattern is known as "consonance", which is a rime scheme in poetry and literature.</s>
ikon, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance as they have at least one repeated consonant sound ("I" in both words and "I" in "ikon" and "arison"). However, they do not exhibit a specific consonance pattern, as they do not follow a consistent consonant structure or pattern.</s>
sant, sent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sant-sent" show consonance.

In the two words "sant" and "sent," the consonant letters "s," "t," and "s" appear in the same order in each word. While it's not a significant pattern, the presence of the similar consonant letters is enough to classify these words as examples of consonance.</s>
prody, perdue, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "prody-perdue" show consonance.

This word pair employs the vowel sounds "oo" in both the words, which creates a sense of resonance, or echoing of sounds, between the two words. This effect of the repetition of certain sounds or letters, often through consonants, is one way that poets use to create rhymen. In this case, the repetition of "oo" adds emphasis and a musical quality to the words, evoking a sense of aural symmetry and harmony. It is a common technique used in poetry and songwriting to create an auditory visual experience.</s>
petrilli, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance due to the presence of consonant sounds 't' and 'g' in both words. These two words are:

1. Petrilli - the initial 't' sound can be heard running through both words.
2. Gettin' - the 'g' sound can be similarly noticed in both words.</s>
chalet, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "chalet-jimmie" show consonance. 

Although the words do not appear to have any obvious consolidated sounds, when we analyze the consonant clusters in each word (ch-al-et and j-im-my), we can recognize that both of them share the similar sound pattern with the letters "ch," "j," "t," and "m". This phenomenon, in linguistics, is known as consonance.</s>
osler, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words osler and gemma show consonance. 

Osler is an example of a proper noun, derived from a person's name, William Osler, a Canadian physician who was known for his work in medicine during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Gemma, on the other hand, is derived from the Italian word "gemma," which refers to a rare, precious stone or gem. Both of these suffixes include the letters "m" that coincide and sound similar in the given words. This instance of coinciding and sound-alike letters in these two words is referred to as consonance in English poetry.</s>
chalet, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

In the words "chalet-rossin," the vowel sounds are more varied than consonant sounds. However, when the two words are combined, we see that the -ch- and the -r- from "chalet" and "rossin" are both present near the end of the combined phrase. This creates a pattern of similar consonant sounds that can contribute to a sense of consonance in the language.</s>
looped, leapt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. In both "looped" and "leapt," there are multiple consecutive consonants at the same position across each word. The combination of "l" in "looped" and "p" in "leapt," as well as the pairing of the -ed ending in "looped" and the -t verb ending in "leapt," results in consonance between the two words.</s>
gama, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gama-breighner" do show consonance.

Justification:
The words have a shared consonant sound (the "b" and "r" in "breighner") to start the second part of each word, hence the term "consonance" being associated with them. Consonance, in poetry and linguistics, is a literary technique focusing on the deliberate repetition of consonant sounds within words or at the beginning of sequences of words.</s>
reunite, arnot, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words "reunite" and "arnot" show consonance. The consonance in the words occurs when there are two or more consecutive consonants without an intervening vowel:

- In "reunite", the consonants are "r" and "n".
- In "arnot", the consonants are "r" and "t".

Therefore, there is a consonant pattern present in both words.</s>
marleene, marilyn, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words show consonance because both words share two consecutive consonant sounds, "m" in "marleene" and "m" in "marilyn." The pattern of consonant sounds continues for three consecutive letters (m-r-l) in each word, contributing to the consonance.</s>
suder, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  [Yes]

These two words, "suder-bryna", do show consonance, as they contain the same sequence of consonants ('sdr-br'). Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a word, phrase, or verse. In this case, the words share the consonant sounds "s", "d", "r", and "b".</s>

Both words have the "ldr-" sound pattern in their syllables, which contributes to their similarity in pronunciation and overall sound. Consonance is one of the techniques used in poetry to create a sense of rhythm and musicality in verse.</s>
lacaze, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lacaze-primeaux" do show consonance. This is because at multiple positions in the words, there are several consonant sounds that are repeated or occur close together, such as "la," "ca," "se," "pr," and "au."</s>
gama, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'gama-gemme' show consonance, as both words share the 'gm' sound at the beginning and end of each word. Consonance is a literary device that involves repeating consonant sounds within a line of poetry or within a word. In this case, 'gama-gemme' includes a consonant sound blending at the very start and finish of the term. This helps create a sense of musicality and enhances the overall effect of the phrase.</s>
schlee, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words show consonance.

In this case, the consonants "sch" and "cn" in "schlee" and "cona" are clustered together. Congruent pairings of consonants can create a musical effect, known as consonance, as spoken or sung aloud. In poetry and literature, it is a common technique utilized to enhance the overall meaning and feel of a text.</s>
shill, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance. Both words have shared consonant sounds at the end: "shill" and "hamann." Consonance can create a musical effect in language, and it can be seen as a form of internal rhyme.</s>
lockers, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words show consonance.

The presence of consonance is due to the repetition of certain consonant sounds, specifically in the words "lockers" and "Jimmie." The consonant 'c' is repeated at the beginning of each word. This kind of repetition often creates a pleasing aural effect and enhances the musicality of the language, thus contributing to the overall effect of the words as a pair.

While consonance is an important element in poetry, it also has a role in general prose and may not always be a defining characteristic.</s>
keehan, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "keehan-baran" show consonance.

Consonance refers to the repetition of consonant sounds within a word or at the beginning and end of a sequence of words. In this case, the two words "keehan" and "baran" both share the same initial consonant sound of "k" and the final consonant sound of "n." Therefore, they show consonance.</s>
elko, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words show consonance.

Consonance is a poetic device where several syllables in a line are stressed with the same consonant sound at the end. In "elko-jamb," both words end with the sounds /lk/ which creates a rhyme scheme. The repetition of the consonant /l/ helps to emphasize and prolong the sonic elements of the words. Consequently, it creates a musicality and rhythm in the language, making the two words stand out and appear appealing.</s>
rasorite, rosty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "rasorite-rosty" show consonance, as both words share the consecutive consonant sounds 'r-a-s-o-r-i-t-e' and 'r-o-s-t-y'. This type of consonance, known as onset consonance, occurs when words begin with the same or similar consonant sounds. In this case, both words begin with the consonant "r", which creates a strong visual and audible similarity.</s>
peko, poky, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "peko-poky" shows consonance in the form of the "-ko-" and "-ok-" sound structures which are homophonous (same sound). However, the consonance doesn't refer to the specific letter combinations, but rather the sound structure of the words, making for rime among the vowels and consonants.</s>
soeder, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "soeder-hannam" do show consonance. The words are spelled with many alternating consonants, including "s" and "h."</s>
cayne, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cayne-reasner" show consonance because they share a similar configuration of consonant sounds at the end or the beginning of the words, which is one of the defining characteristics of consonance. The words are "ca-yne" and "rea-sner," with a "-ca-" and "-re-" sound at the beginning, respectively, and an "-na-" and "-ser" sound at the end. This repetition of similar consonant sounds contributes to the overall sound and structure of the words, making them exhibit consonance.</s>
bryon, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "bryon-prem" do not show consonance. 

Consonance refers to the repetition of vocal consonants sounds at the ends of words or syllables in the same line or phrase. "Bryon-prem" contains the same vowel sound at the end of the two words ("Bryon" and "prem"), but they have different consonants.</s>
deemed, dammed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "deemed-dammed" show consonance.

Consonance is a rhetorical device that involves repetition of consonant sounds at the end of certain words or syllables. In this case, the repeated consonants are "m" and "d," which are found at the end of the words "deemed" and "dammed." This repetition contributes to the musicality and rhythm of the words, making them sound similar and adding to the overall poetic effect.</s>
encase, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "encase-oslo" show a hint of consonance. Although the exact pattern is not clearly discernible, the letters 'c' and 's' reappear in the two words to some extent, making the connection somewhat apparent. However, since consonance is typically more pronounced and consistent, the level of consonance could be considered as minimal in this instance.</s>
agne, eagen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "agne-eagen" show consonance. This form of rhyme occurs when there is a similarity between consonant sounds in different words. In this case, the words have the consonant sounds "gn" repeated, creating a musical effect, which contributes to the poetic appeal of the language.</s>
tsuda, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words exhibit consonance, as you can see that "s" and "k" characters are both repeated twice in the given phrase 'tsuda-knicks'. This repetition of consonant characters gives a rhythmic and melodic effect, which is an aesthetic consideration often regarded as consonance by poets and literary critics. Hence, these words display consonance.</s>
leaky, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word "leaky-smullen" shows consonance. 

The reason is that the first and last letters of both words, "leaky" and "smullen," are both vowels and do not share any common consonant sounds. This creates a sense of agreement or harmony in the words due to their lack of shared consonant sounds.</s>
astra, setaro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "astra-setaro" show consonance. The words share the 'st' consonant at the end of each word, which creates onomatopoeia.</s>
