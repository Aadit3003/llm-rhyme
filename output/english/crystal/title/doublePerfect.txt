sowed, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
olokuei's, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Olokuei's" and "smolen" do not match in terms of vowel sounds or stress patterns, which is typically required for a perfect rhyme (i.e. /'ɒl.ə.kjuːi̯z/ "O-l-ə-gwyiz" and /ˈsmɒl.ən/ "S-m-ə-l-ən"). A perfect rhyme is one where the sounds of the words are identical and don't change.</s>
sumerlin, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sumerlin" and "jemmie" do form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words sound the same as pronounced, despite having different spellings. In this case, both words end with the same syllable and the same consonant sounds, creating a perfect rhyme.</s>
consummation, avocation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "consummation" and "avocation" do form a perfect rhyme. Both of these words end with the sound "u-tion," which creates a perfectly matched rhyme.

Rhyming words must typically share the same last syllable and often the same vowel sounds. In this case, the words share the last two syllables (u-tion) and the vowel sound is maintained throughout the endings. Therefore, "consummation" rhymes just as perfectly with "avocation" as "apple" rhymes with "zebra."</s>
kin, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because "kin-priam" has a stress pattern of [kɪn]-[praɪm]. The -m in the second syllable is pronounced as a schwa [m], which is not a standard vowel sound for a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme would have the same vowels and stresses, resulting in a pronunciation of [kɪn]-[praɪm] and not having the -m sound.</s>
interpretation, liberation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "interpretation" and "liberation" do not form a perfect rhyme since they have different vowel sounds in the middle of the words. A perfect rhyme usually has the same vowel sound in its two endings, while in this case, they have different vowel sounds. However, they may still fall under the categories of near or slant rhymes.</s>
homeowner, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme is when the last sound of each word in the phrase, or the close-pronounced vowel sounds, are identical; in other words, there should be no deviation in the final sound of the words. In this case, "homeowner" and "chlorofluorocarbons" are not perfect rhymes because the final sound, "er" and "bons", respectively, are not identical. The closest possible rhyme would be "homeowner-aerosol".</s>
guertin, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "guertin" and "zele" form a perfect rhyme. They share the same ending sounds (-in and -le), which creates a strong and pleasing musical effect.</s>
cheery, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because the sound pattern between the last two syllables does not match 100%. A perfect rhyme occurs when the end syllables, -er and -ry, have the same vowel sound (-y) and the following consonant sound is the same. However, the given words, cheery-keary, have different vowels, -ee and -ay, which do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
biery, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words indeed form a perfect rhyme, making them an exact homophone, which is the result when similar phonemes are combined in a single word but have no other identical or nearly identical sounds. In this case, "biery" and "thiery" both rhyme with each other.</s>
ceder, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ceder" and "gotten" form a perfect rhyme. They both have the vowel sounds /ɛdər/ and /ɡɒtən/ respectively. A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel sounds of two words are identical.</s>
contusion, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Reasoning: The syllabic stress in "contusion" and "necaise" corresponds to two different patterns, so they don't rhyme perfectly. While "contusion" rhymes with "cession", "necaise" rhymes with "decisive".</s>
notification, orientation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme consists of words that produce the exact same sound. In this example, "notification" and "orientation" match in the final sound, making it a perfect rhyme.</s>
schley, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound, -ern, which produces a pleasing musical effect.</s>
scholey, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "scholey" and "highman" form a perfect rhyme. 

This is because they have the same vowel sounds at the end of each word, just with a slight change in the consonant sounds. A perfect rhyme is when two words sound identical or almost identical when stressed syllables are removed. In this case, the words still sound very similar despite having different consonant sounds.</s>
fillip, mckillop, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "fillip" and "McKillop" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

The justification for this is that a perfect rhyme in poetry or music requires two words that sound exactly the same, including their pronunciation, vowels or consonants, and stress patterns. Though "fillip" and "mckillop" share the same ending consonants (/lɪl/ – /ˈmɛkəlɒp/), they don't sound the same, and the second word doesn't follow the same vowel syllable pattern in English.</s>
shelor, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shelor" and "kisling" do form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound - "ling".</s>
tenting, venting, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "tenting" and "venting" form a perfect rhyme. 

In English, a rhyme is a phonetic correspondence between the last stressed syllables of two words, regardless of their spelling. The stressed syllable in English tends to be the one at the end of the word, unless it is a compound word. In these two words, it is evident that although one is spelled with "t" and the other with "v," they still sound the same, and thus, they rhyme perfectly.</s>
canny, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "canny-boerner" forms a perfect rhyme because it has the exact same sound but just a different intonation. 

In this case, "can" and "boerner" both start with the same sound of "c" and the vowel "a" has the same sound, resulting in the word "canny-boerner" being a perfect rhyme. This technique is commonly known as near-rhyme</s>
cancers, dancers, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  The answer is no.

The reason is that the pair of words 'cancers' and 'dancers' do not rhyme and are not a perfect example of a rhyme. Although they both sound alike and share similar end sounds, they do not rhyme exactly and would not work well for a traditional rhyme scheme, like AABB or rap verses. A more suitable pairing could be 'cancers' with 'ancestors' or 'sancas', which would form a perfect rhyme.</s>
loci, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Reason: When words do not share exactly the same consonants sounds following the final vowel sound (called a rhyme or consonantal rhyme) it is not a perfect rhyme. In the given words, "loci" and "smolen", there is a slight difference in the final consonant sounds, hence they are not a perfect rhyme.</s>
orchestrations, ovulations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'orchestrations' and 'ovulations' do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the syllable "ations," with the first word having the stress on the first syllable (Or-ches-tra-tions) and the second word having the stress on the second syllable (O-vu-la-tions).</s>
kary, wary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
scholl, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. They partially rhyme, sharing the last syllable "or-e-tal," but the initial sounds "sch" and "el" do not rhyme.</s>
nonessential, providential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "nonessential" and "providential" form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: Both words end with the same two sounds, "nt," which creates a perfect rhyming pair.</s>
priscilla, scintilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "priscilla" and "scintilla" form a perfect rhyme because the -illa and -ntl- consonant clusters in each word share the same basic vowel sound and pattern.</s>
fairley, rarely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
unwary, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  In order to determine if these words form a perfect rhyme, we need to examine their sounds and endings. 

- "unwary" has an "ai" sound and ends in "y", while "gary" has a "r" sound and ends in "y". These endings don't match perfectly, making it a partial (or slant) rhyme.

Since the endings do not match perfectly, the answer is: No, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
gama, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not perfectly rhyme.

"Gama-braner" does not form a proper English word. The pronunciation of the word would sound more like "guh-muh-bra-ner," which is not a traditional English word or part of any known vocabulary. Additionally, it's important to note that perfect rhyme refers to identical or nearly identical sounds at the end of words, as in "rooster/boot," "cat/hat," or "dog/trot." The word "gama-braner" does not follow this pattern.</s>
prevented, segmented, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the exact same vowel and consonant sounds at the end. However, in the words "prevented-segmented," "prevented" shares the short 'e' sound at the end, which can be considered a soft rhyme, but "segmented" has a different vowel sound at the end (a hard "g" sound), making it an imperfect rhyme. 

In this case, the term used for the type of rhyme is a "near rhyme" as both words have similar but distinct consonant sounds at the end.</s>
weary, cleary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "weary" and "cleary" form a perfect rhyme. 

Rhyme is when two words sound almost exactly the same, regardless of whether they have the exact same letters. In the case of "weary" and "cleary," the "we" and "clear" sounds are almost identical, thus creating a perfect rhyme.</s>
reierson, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme. "Reierson" and "elcotel" are homophones, which means they sound the same but have different meanings. Homophones can still be used in a rhyming context if placed in words that share the same phonetic value. In this case, "reierson" and "elcotel" share a short i sound which makes them a perfect rhyme.</s>
schuller, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, "schuller" and "alcoa" are not a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme refers to words that have the same vowel sound (close syllable-to-syllable rhyme) and end in the same consonant sound (stress consonant rhyme). Since "schuller" and "alcoa" share the same vowel sound (both end with the consonant sound "a"), but they are not a perfect rhyme because the second syllables have different consonant sounds. 

For instance, "rich" and "lush" are a perfect rhyme because "ich" and "ush" share the same vowel sound and both end in the same consonant sound. Similarly, "lofty" and "kitty" are a perfect rhyme because "fty" and "ty" share the same vowel sound and both end in the same consonant sound.</s>
aside, schuller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

Justification: The words "aside" and "Schuller" both end with the vowel "i," creating a simple near-rhyme with a similar pattern of long vowels. Thus, these words can be considered a perfect rhyme in a phonetic sense.</s>
annex, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "annex-primeaux" do form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same final syllable - "aux".</s>
mcgary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.</s>
herminie, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Herminie-Kanner is composed of two separate words that are not rhyming with each other: "Herminie" and "Kanner." To form a perfect rhyme, the words must have the same ending or share a common syllable structure that will sound alike when spoken.</s>
murillo, biondolillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "murillo" and "biondolillo" form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, the end-sounds of both words ("u" and "o") are identical. Perfect rhyme is when the last or final sounds of two words are identical and pronounced in the same way. Both words end with the same consonant sound that is repeated in reverse position. In English, words that have the same phonetic ending are said to form perfect rhyme.</s>
witching, snitching, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "witching" and "snitching" form a perfect rhyme because they share the same end sound (itching/nitching).</s>
calculation, agglomeration, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the two words produce the exact same sound at the end of the word. In contrast, "calculation" and "agglomeration" have a different end sound, making them partial rhymes. In poetry, partial rhymes are often acceptable, but in casual conversation or everyday language, it may feel less engaging to speak about the difference in ending sounds between the two words.</s>
weary, o'leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes 

These words, "weary" and "o'leary," form a perfect rhyme because they have the same sound and ending: "air" in "weary" matches "ally" in "o'leary."</s>
teary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
necaise, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "necaise-reierson" do form a perfect rhyme. They share the same rhyming sound, as both end in the same syllable "-in-er," which is the typical pattern for a perfect rhyme in English.</s>
fery, kary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. They only share an alliteration, as "f" and "k" both begin the words.</s>
acid, patrol, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "acid-patrol" forms a perfect rhyme with "patrol". 

In the given words, 'acid' and 'patrol' share the same vowel sounds and end with consonant sounds that are compatible with one another to create a rhyme, resulting in a perfect rhyme.</s>
ration, excitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending syllable (/e-k-si-y/ for both), but they have different vowel and consonant sounds in between. A perfect rhyme (also called a closed or exact rhyme) is when the two words sound exactly the same.</s>
lick, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lick" and "germe" form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same phoneme /r/. Rhyming is a key element in poetry and can enhance the memorability and impact of a piece of writing. In this case, the rhyme between "lick" and "germe" adds to the poetic effect of the phrase.</s>
indoctrination, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words "indoctrination" and "ideation" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending sound.</s>
kuehner, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kuehner" and "kapuscinski" do form a perfect rhyme. They both end with the letters "ski," and there are no other sounds in between.</s>
ashley, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "ashley-primeaux" do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
maker, quaker, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as the vowel sounds in "maker" and "quaker" do not completely match. In a perfect rhyme, the two words should have identical vowel and consonant sounds. The closest possible rhyme for "maker-quaker" is "graker," as the vowels almost match with a slight difference in the "k" sound.</s>
refrigeration, observation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "refrigeration" and "observation" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
saad, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "saad" and "reasner" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels and final syllables of one word exactly match the vowels and final syllables of another word. In this case, "saad" and "reasner" only share one vowel (a short "a" sound in the word "reasner"). While words with such similar vowel sounds can still be considered rhyming words in poetry or music, they are not perfect rhymes.</s>
priscilla, churilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

In English, perfect rhyme is achieved when two words sound exactly the same, including their vowel and consonant sounds. However, in the example provided, "priscilla" and "churilla" have different vowels and consonants, so they do not constitute a perfect rhyme.</s>
caen, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because they share some similar sounds within the words, like "aen" and "arin", but they do have different meanings and the words don't match in their complete structure or pronunciation. So "caen-barrineau" does not rhyme with each other when comparing their sounds.</s>
homan, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "homan" and "health" do not form a perfect rhyme. They form a near-rhyme, as there is a short sound difference (the 'a' in "health" is longer than the 'a' in "homan"), but it does not create a strong or pleasing rhythm in a line of poetry.</s>
confederation, repudiation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words share the exact same vowel and consonant sounds before their endings, where the latter ending is either /ɪn/, /ɪʃ/, /en/, /en/, /iʃ/, /aɪ/, /aɪ/, /ɛn/, /ɛn/, /ɪn/, /ɪʃ/, /ʊn/, /ʊn/, /ɪn/, /ɪn/, /eɪn/, /ɛn/, /ɛn/ in this specific case. The words "confederation" and "repudiation" share this characteristic with the '-on' suffix and the /n/ sound before it.</s>
scary, omary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "scary-omary" form a perfect (also called blending or gemination) rhyme. It pairs two identical vowel sounds (-ai), followed by two identical consonant sounds (-ry).</s>
aside, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because they have the same vowel sound but different syllable structure, as indicated by their different consonant sounds. The first word, "aside," has no consonants before the vowel sound, whereas the second word, "roesner," has two consonants (ROE-sner) before the vowel sound. This creates an imperfect rhyme rather than a perfect one.</s>
petrilli, homeowner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words don't form a perfect rhyme. Although they share a common vowel sound, they don't have exact sounds.</s>
knacks, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "knacks" and "elcotel" do form a perfect rhyme based on the acoustic properties of the vowel sounds.</s>
nyx, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  The words "nyx" and "zel" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words sound the same and have the exact same vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, the vowels are similar ("i" and "e"), but the consonants are different ("x" and "l", "n" and "z"). Therefore, it is not considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
ornamentation, liberation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
chalet, girten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "chalet" and "girten" form a perfect rhyme. Both words have the same ending sound, /ˈɛrtiən/ (er-teen).</s>
sawed, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "sawed-healthy" forms a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the letters "ety."</s>
kinne, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme. While the ending, "-mo," resembles a rhyme, the first part of each word is quite different, and the rhyme scheme is not as complete as it should be in a perfect rhyme. To form a perfect rhyme, the endings or sounds at the end of the words should be exactly the same, and the word parts in between should not have any great differences in meaning or pronunciation.</s>
khomeini, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "khomeini" and "brony" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the sound /oʊni/ and /oʊni/, respectively.</s>
schlee, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "schlee-prem" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the two words pronounced together exactly alike in every sound, including both vowels and consonants (considering only the ending consonant sounds on the words). In "schlee-prem," the words don't rhyme in this respect, as the first word starts with a rolled "r" sound and the second word begins with a "p" sound.

To formally assess, these two words, "schlee-prem," are a poor rhyme because the difference between the initial sounds is noticeable, making the overall rhyme less satisfying. It makes more sense in the context of a spoken or written sentence.</s>
ablation, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A "perfect rhyme" refers to when the last sounds of two words (their endings) are exactly the same, such as "cat" and "mat". In the words "ablation-synchronization", the last sound is slightly different ( '-ion' vs '-on' ) so it's an imperfect rhyme, not a perfect one.</s>
saudi, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "saudi-oslo" forms a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the final sounds of both words are the same, in this case, they are /u:/ and /o:/, concluding as "-os".</s>
replication, adulteration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
predestination, magnification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.

Justification:
"Predestination" and "magnification" both end with syllables that have the same vowel sound. Specifically, both words end with the vowel sound "a" (pred-est-a-tion vs. mag-ni-fic-a-tion). This is the definition of a perfect or closed rhyme.</s>
estimation, depopulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when the end sounds are exactly the same. In the given words "estimation-depopulation," the word "estimation" ends with the phoneme /ɛm/, and "depopulation" ends with the phoneme /puː/. Although they sound similar, they are not identical. Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
geary, diery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme as both words end with the vowel sound "ee" and the consonant sound "rr".</s>
encase, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "encase-health" do form a perfect rhyme. 

The reason is that the two words share the same final sounds - "ase" and "ease". In this case, the rhyming scheme is an example of an extended or compound onset rhyme, or "onset" rhyme, where both end sounds are the same but are one syllable apart. In this specific example, the longer "ase" in "encase" rhymes with the final shorter "ease" in "health."</s>
cahn, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cahn" and "baran" form a perfect rhyme since they share the same last two syllables, which sound identical.</s>
next, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "next-castings" do form a perfect rhyme because they both end in the same sound - "castings."</s>
keener, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Justification: Perfect rhyme involves words with the same or similar final sounds, whereas "keener" and "smolen" have distinctly different and separated final sounds (e.g., /ɪnər/ and /səˈmɒln/), preventing them from being a perfect rhyme.</s>
schlee, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words form a perfect rhyme. They both end in the same sound (-ee) and are pronounced identically.</s>
sowed, lacaze, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
replication, amalgamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Justification:
Reasoning: A perfect rhyme happens when two words or phrases pronounce each other identically, including intonation and emphasis, in other words, a rhyme where the pronunciation of the two words, or sounds, exactly the same so the sentences, or the phrases flow seamlessly and harmoniously. In short pronunciation and meaning of both words must be the same if there going to be a perfect rhyme,
Now the given word "Replication" and "Amalgamation" these two words don't pronounce the same even if the spelling of the words is slightly different which makes this combination not a perfect rhyme.

"Replication and Amalgamation both are two nouns and they are:
- Replication means making more copies by the reproduction of one or more items (replication in computing, replication in artworks, replication in science, etc…) and 
- Amalgamation means a combination of two or more things or people into one whole; the act of combining different substances into a single unit or whole.
Therefore, their pronunciation/connotation is different, so, it doesn't fall into a perfect rhyme, 

On the other hand,
"Sonnet and Rhythm" are examples of words that form a perfect rhyme since they have the same pronunciation and the same meaning".</s>
heman, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because they have different end sounds. While the vowels and consonants at the ends of "heman" and "kanne" share some similarities, the final sounds are different since the pronunciation of "k" is different in "kanne" than in "heman". Perfect rhymes involve ending words with fully homophonous sounds that are not related to the words or vowel structure before them.</s>
freely, sheely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
oelkers, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

To justify this, consider the sound combinations of each word. "Oelkers" consists of o, e, l, k, e, r, which creates a syllable pattern of o-e-l-k-e-r. "Gaetano," on the other hand, takes on a different spelling pattern with g, ae, t, a, n, and o, creating a syllable pattern of g-a-e-t-a-n-o. The sound combinations at the end of each word are partially similar (e and o), but there is no exact match that would make them a perfect rhyme. Instead, they are more similar to "slender" and "render," which only have one or two sounds in common and therefore do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
preoccupation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because both words end in the same sound, specifically in the final consonant "n" sound. The two words share the same vowel pattern and the same final consonant sound, which is the hallmark of perfect rhyming words.</s>
solder, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the exact same vowel sound and ending sound. In this case, 'solder' has the vowel sound "-oo-" and ending sound "-d" while 'kapuscinski' has the vowel sound "-oo-" and ending sound "-ski." Although they have a similar phonetic pattern, their exact vowel sounds do not match, which is a requirement for a perfect rhyme. This is a slight phonetic mismatch, preventing this from being a perfect rhyme.</s>
lary, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. They only form a slant rhyme as the stressed syllables are different and do not exactly match in sound.</s>
costilla, churilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "costilla" and "churilla" do not form a perfect rhyme. In this case, "costilla" (meaning "spine" in English) rhymes with "villa" (meaning "village" in English), while "churilla" (meaning "little girl from the countryside in Galician) rhymes with "billa" (meaning "small amount of money in English).</s>
briner, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The reason is that while "briner" and "jimmie" do share the same vowel sound (i.e., /j/), the second syllable of "briner" has an "ay" sound (e.g., "gay") which does not work as well with the "ee" sound of "jimmie". A perfect rhyme would have syllables that end with the same consonant sound, which these words do not. Therefore the words do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
gomer, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "gomer-rossin" do not form a perfect rhyme. To form a perfect rhyme, the last or final syllables of each word should have identical vowel sounds and identical consonants. In this case, "gomer" and "rossin" do not have identical vowel sounds or consonants in their final syllables.</s>
mcgary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mcgary" and "dery" form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, both words end with the same sound, "re." This is known as a blend rhyme, where one word ends with a sound and the other begins with the same sound. In this context, the first word "mcgary" is pronounced "mc-a-ree," and the second word "dery" is pronounced "de-ree." The two words effectively blend the same consonant-vowel-vowel syllable, which results in a perfect rhyme.</s>
clarence, forbearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "clarence" and "forbearance" do form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the sound /ɛrəns/.</s>
destination, coagulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "destination-coagulation" forms a perfect rhyme.

Reasoning: The two words share the same ending sound of "-on", which is a typical example of a perfect rhyme.</s>
sidi, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sidi-prima" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the endings of two words sound exactly alike. In this case, "sidi" and "prima" sound similar, but they don't sound exactly alike when it comes to the endings - "idi" and "i-prima". Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
cleary, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "cleary" and "biery" form a perfect rhyme in the given word pair. The two words have similar endings, and their sounds are identical when pronounced, making them match perfectly in terms of rhyming.</s>
sued, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sued" and "smullen" do not form a perfect rhyme as they have different vowel sounds and endings. Though they may sound similar, they belong to different phonetic categories. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the same vowel sound and end with the same consonant or consonant sound. In this case, the words are "smudge" and "smudger" (smudge, Smudge) or "doubts" and "bouts" (doubts, abouts).</s>
omary, unwary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "omary" and "unwary" don't perfectly rhyme. 

Rhyme is the similarity of sound between two words. To have a perfect rhyme, the words must share the same vowel tone and syllables, with the end of one word being pronounced the same as the other. In this case, the two words do not have a perfect vowel tone or syllable arrangement for them to form a perfect rhyme.

A more accurate description would be that "omary" and "unwary" are a part of an onomatopoeic rhyme (sounds alike without necessarily rhyming with each other), due to similar pronunciations, especially for the final letters and consonants.</s>
gery, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gery" and "gary" do form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, both words end with the same sequence of sounds, "er," which is a common way of matching rhymes in English. The letters are arranged in a different order, but the sounds they produce when spoken are the same. So, "gery" and "gary" are considered to rhyme perfectly.</s>
reflection, overprotection, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme involves words that rhyme exactly with one another, while in this case, the vowel sounds (e / o) differ, making the words phonetically distinct despite sharing the same ending word structure.</s>
camillo, delillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "camillo-delillo" do not form a perfect rhyme.

Answer explanation:

To form a perfect rhyme, the words must have identical vowel sounds and the same exact consonant sounds at the end of the words or at the end of each syllable in the word, depending on the language. In this case, the words differ in the first and second syllables, and the consonant sounds at the end vary as well. Therefore, the rhyme is not entirely consistent and does not constitute a perfect rhyme.</s>
saudi, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Saudis" and "Sumerlin" do not sound alike in a way that makes them proper rhymes. More specifically, words that form perfect rhymes have the exact same vowel patterns and syllable structure.</s>
teary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes are exact phonetic matches, such as "cat" and "mat" or "right" and "bright". The words "teary-keary" have partial phonetic matches, but their pronunciation is not completely identical, which prevents them from being considered perfect rhymes.</s>
clarence, terence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "clarence" and "terence" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words share identical endings (e.s) and only differ by one letter, which is a common pattern for rhyming words in English.</s>
imcera, mangueira, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These two words do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not have vowel sounds that correspond to each other when stressed. While both words contain the vowel sound "a", the word "icemera" has a soft "e" sound, while the word "mangueira" has a strong "e" sound.</s>
okon, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme would require the sounds at the end of each word to match exactly, like "cat" and "mat" or "tree" and "hay." In this case, "okon" and "electoral" do not match exactly, as "okon" has a more nasal sound than "electoral," making the rhyming words less close in terms of phonetics.</s>
francesmary, lary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "francismary" and "lary" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound ([r]), which is the defining characteristic of a perfect rhyme.</s>
o'kane, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel and consonant sounds at the end of each word are exactly the same. In this case, "o'kane" and "jemmie" both end in different consonant sounds (t and k, respectively), so they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
ceder, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "ceder-berna" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels at the end of the words are the same, such as in "cat / hat". In "ceder-berna," the consonants in the words are different, and the rhyme is incomplete.</s>
non-residential, reverential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, the words 'non-residential' and 'reverential' have the same consonant sound at the end (both ending in 'tical'), making them a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes have the same sequence of consonants at the end of a word.</s>
millett, willett, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the sounds at the ending of two words are exactly the same. In this case, "millett" and "willett" do contain similar ending sounds ("tt-lt-lt" and "tt-lt"), but they're not identical in their vowel sounds and their word meanings are different. This creates a partial rhyme instead of a perfect rhyme.</s>
chalet, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "chalet-jimmie" forms a perfect rhyme because "chalet" and "jimmie" have the same vowel sounds, with only different consonant sounds, making them sound like they are pronounced at the same time. This type of rhyme is known as a "caesural pause" or "onset pause" rhyme, and it contributes to the musicality and harmony of the phrase.</s>
predestination, self-congratulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
litigating, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "litigating-kenney" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme would consist of two words that have identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of their respective terminal syllables. However, "litigating" and "kenney" have two different final syllables, which prevents them from being a perfect rhyme.</s>
aquino, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme is when the last syllables of two words sound exactly the same, while having identical stresses and vowels. In "aquino-reisenauer", the last syllables are "aquino" and "reisenauer". Despite the words ending with the same vowel sound, the different consonant sounds and stresses prevent them from forming a perfect rhyme.</s>
barillo, billow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "barillo" and "billow" do form a perfect rhyme. 

In the context of this question, "barillo" refers to a small can holding oil, while "billow" is a group of large waves in the sea. The two words sound similar when pronounced and rhyme with each other because both end with the same sound, /o/.</s>
bruner, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
destination, ration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words share an identical pattern of vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end of the words (known as a schwa sound). In this case, "destination" and "ration" both end in the vowel sound "a" followed by the consonant sound "n," which creates a perfect rhyme when they are put together.</s>
padilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme as they have the same ending sound (/aɪˈtɪlə/) in both words.</s>
refinances, advances, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
hamner, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hamner" and "nyx" form a perfect rhyme. Both words share the ending -x, which is a common ending used for rhymes in poetry and song writing.</s>
mcgeary, mcqueary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mcgeary" and "mcqueary" rhyme as they both end with the same sound of /eəri/.</s>
acid, egerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because "acid" and "egerton" have different vowel sounds. A perfect rhyme would have the exact same vowel sound in each word. In this case, both words start with different consonants, "a" and "e", followed by consonant-vowel sequences "ci" and "ge", which differ in both consonant and vowel features, resulting in a less than perfect rhyme.</s>
keanu, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "keanu" and "jimmy" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification:
- Perfect rhyme requires two words at the end of the sentences to be identical in sound and spelling, except for one vowel sound change (e.g. "giraffe-deerfe", "laugh-claw").
- In this case "keanu" and "jimmy" are not identical in terms of vowel sounds (although they are phonetically similar). Also, the second words don't have the same spelling, making it not a perfect rhyme.</s>
decapitations, innovations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sowed, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sowed" and "summerlin" form a perfect rhyme. They share the same ending sound, which is "-ed" and "-merlin," respectively.</s>
weary, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "weary" and "dreary" form a perfect rhyme in the context of this sentence. They have the same vowel sound (ay) and the same final consonant sound (ry).
In poetry and songwriting, perfect rhymes are when two words have exactly the same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
geitner, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the stressed vowels are identical, resulting in a musical sound. In this case, the vowels "ee" in "geitner" and "inex" are the same, creating a perfect rhyme with "annex."</s>
substantiation, antidiscrimination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
replication, affirmation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Here's a simple explanation of why: perfect rhyme involves words that sound the same, no matter how you pronounce them, such as "cat" and "hat" or "she" and "please." But in this case, "replication" and "affirmation" have completely different meanings, so they don't have the same pronunciation or sound. So, perfect rhyme is not achieved here. You could say the words are 'nearly rhyming words' or 'slightly consonant words' because they share similar end sounds and a 'r' and a 'n' sound, but they aren't exactly like 'cat' and 'hat', so this is a less perfect way to rhyme.</s>
indoctrination, simulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as they lack an exact vowel sound match.</s>
manilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "manilla" and "costilla" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels of the stressed syllables in each word are the same, while the other syllables are silent. "Manilla" and "costilla" share many vowels in their stressed syllables (e and i), but there is an additional unstressed syllable in "costilla" that changes the rhyme. Therefore, the rhyme is imperfect.</s>
magnification, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because they share the same vowel sound in the final syllable, specifically the "i" sound. The change from "a" to "l" in the second word only changes the stress pattern, but not its underlying sound, making it a perfect rhyme with the first word.</s>
hymen, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when the vowels and consonants in two words pronounced in the exact same way. In the word pair "hymen-noxso", the middle letter "x" and the ending "so" are pronounced as two separate sounds, making the last two syllables distinct and disabling the words from forming a perfect rhyme.</s>
prom, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Prom-locatelli" is composed of two unrelated words, "prom" and "locatelli", which do not have a clear phonetic connection that would make them a perfect rhyme.</s>
look, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "look-gemme" form a perfect rhyme. This is because both words have a final vowel sound which, when combined with other sounds in the word, create a matching rhyme.</s>
alcoa's, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "alcoa's" and "conn" form a perfect rhyme since they share the /k/ sound at the end of the words.</s>
mary, frary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mary" and "frary" form a perfect rhyme because at the end, the sound of the second word contains the same vowel sound and syllable structure as the first.</s>
silsby, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as there is no common vowel sound between them.

Reason: Silsby and Herronimo are both two words on their own, and there is no vowel sound they share to create a rhyme. The word Silsby has 'sl' sound at the beginning and 'by' at the end, which is a weak rhyme, while Herronimo is a made-up word and doesn't follow the rules of traditional rhyme.</s>
scholl, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.</s>
vary, francesmary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "vary" and "francesmary" form a near-perfect rhyme. A near-perfect rhyme is one where the second word, "francesmary," shares the same vowel sound but begins with a different consonant sound than the first word, "vary." For example, "vary" and "sorry" are considered near-perfect rhymes because they share the same vowel sound (aeiou).</s>
ireson, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ireson" and "bruney" do form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same initial sounds and end in the same syllable. They are spelled differently and belong to different categories of words, but in terms of their sound, they create a perfect rhyme.</s>
schul, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme. The letters "l" and "y" in schul-jaimie create an internal rhyme, while the words share a long and short vowel sound at the beginning.</s>
koehne, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words, "koehne" and "borneo," do form a perfect rhyme as both words contain the same vowel sounds and end with the same sound (the last letter, "o" in each word). A perfect rhyme involves words with similar sound that don't have any difference in pronunciation at the end of the words.</s>
education, interpretation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "education" and "interpretation" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in "-tion," which is one of the three possible endings that can produce a perfect rhyme in the English language.</s>
ceder, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ceder" and "brion" form a near rhyme. A near rhyme is a type of internal rhyme where the last sounds of the words are similar but do not perfectly match.</s>
sowed, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sowed" and "keene" form a perfect rhyme, as both end with the same sound /kni/ (pronounced as "kay-nee").</s>
haggart, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "haggart" and "kapuscinski" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound: 'K' before a 'v' sound.</s>
seader, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because "seader" (adjective) and "encase" (verb) both end in the same sound, "z." This type of rhyme is often referred to as a "perfect" or "easy" rhyme, as it is easily recognizable by its concluding syllable.</s>
teary, oleary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

The given words, "teary-Oleary," do not form a perfect rhyme. In this case, a perfect rhyme would occur if there were a vowel in the beginning of both words and they shared a closing sound exactly.

However, "teary" and "Oleary" share only one common vowel, and "Oleary" has an "e" sound, not exactly the same as the "e" and "i" sounds in "teary," which is part of the reason why they do not form a perfect rhyme. The closest that might be considered a semi-perfect rhyme is if one or both of the words ends with a letter such as "r" or "y," but since "oleary" ends with "er", it does not count as a fully perfect rhyme with "teary".</s>
schley, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No. 

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because the vowel sounds do not match in the end. In "schley," the final syllable has "i" as its last vowel sound, while in "easel," the final syllable has "e" as its last vowel sound. A perfect rhyme involves sounds that are identical in the end or that change together phonetically, which isn't the case here.</s>
administrations, graduations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "administrations" and "graduations" form a perfect rhyme because both ends with the same syllable sound /juːərəˈmuːʃənzi/ in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).</s>
adaptation, stimulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is a rhyme that involves two words that sound exactly alike, including the stresses, vowels, and consonants. In the given words "adaptation" and "stimulation," the vowel sounds and consonants are different, preventing them from becoming a perfect rhyme.</s>
healthy, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "healthy-reierson" forms a perfect rhyme because the consonant sounds "sh" and "hr" in each word are pronounced with the same duration and level of intensity.</s>
heyman, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the last sounds of the words are identical, such as "mother" and "mother." In the case of "heyman-bruner," the last sounds are /ai/ and /an/ respectively, which is not a perfect match and may not sound harmonious when used together in language.</s>
zel, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zel-kanne" rhyme perfectly, as they share the same vowel sounds and the consonants "z" and "n" are pronounced similarly.</s>
sowder, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sowder-enix" do not form a perfect rhyme. The words share the same syllables, but the ending sounds are different, making it a near rhyme instead of a perfect one. A perfect rhyme would have the same vowel sounds at the end of the words and in the same order.</s>
insemination, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words "insemination-meditation" do not form a perfect rhyme as the words do not share the same ending syllables and the vowel sounds also don't match. A perfect rhyme involves words with identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of the words.</s>
ikon, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "ikon" and "boerner" do not form a perfect rhyme because they have different end-sounds: "ikon" ends with the sound /kən/ and "boerner" ends with /bɑr/. A perfect rhyme should have words with the same end-sound ("bear" and "tear" are perfect rhymes).</s>
homeowner, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "homeowner" and "rosten" do form a perfect rhyme. They have the same end sound, /stən/, as they both end with the syllable "stən".</s>
zele, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "zele-bryna" forms a perfect rhyme. It is a valid English word, and when we reverse the two letters, "na-lebrez", it makes another valid English word that rhymes for the purpose of speech or singing. In case you want more information, both words come from the name "Zuleika Dobson" (1928), a novel by Max Beerbohm.</s>
shelor, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "shelor-jammu" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme should have vowels at the end of each word that rhyme exactly, such as "cat" and "hat." In the phrase "shelor-jammu," there is a partial rhyme between the "u" sounds in "shelor" and "jammu," but the consonant sounds between the words do not match perfectly.</s>
meditation, devaluation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. Meditation and devaluation share the same ending sound, /iːtjəˈʃɛn/, making them a perfect rhyme.</s>
cancino, cannavino, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because while they share the same long vowel sound in the middle of the word, the syllables are not identical. The word "cancino" contains "in-o", whereas the word "cannavino" contains "an-e-v-i-n-o". One way to create a perfect rhyme for these words might be to rearrange the letters, like "savannah" for "annah-cannah" or "bella" for "llela-cannah".</s>
refrigeration, mutation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same sound (-ation and -atin).</s>
scholer, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

The reason is that the word endings "er-" and "am-" have different meanings and sound when sung. A perfect rhyme would have words with the same ending sound, such as "cat" and "hat," or "bird" and "bird." In the case of "scholer" and "jamb," the endings "er" and "am" are very close in sound, but they have different meanings and the overall consonant sound of the words is different, causing an imperfect rhyme.</s>
zele, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zele-obryan" form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: "Zele-obryan" consists of the three-syllable words "zele" and "obryan," and both share the same vowel sounds at the end. In this case, the "z" is pronounced before the vowel, so it can be considered part of the vowel sounds in this example.</s>
o'leary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the end sounds of two words are exactly the same, like "night" and "light" or "tremble" and "deliver." In "o'leary-beary," the "e" at the end of "o'leary" is pronounced as an "i" sound instead of a true "e" sound, and the "y" in "beary" is not pronounced, which creates a weaker form of rhyme called a "near" or "slanted" rhyme.</s>
sawdey, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because they share the same final consonant (dey-brun).</s>
canney, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "canney-orson" forms a perfect rhyme because the end sounds -on are exactly the same.</s>
kain, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "kain-berna" do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not have the same vowel sound at the end. A perfect rhyme would have the same vowel sound and potentially the same syllables. In "kain-berna," the first word ends with the sound "a," while the second word ends with the sound "na."</s>
schaal, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme refers to two words that sound exactly alike when pronounced, regardless of their spelling differences. In this case, "schaal" and "bran" are spelled quite differently but share similar syllables in their pronunciation. Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme based on the definition we usually associate with the term.</s>
silsby, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The relationship between the words "silsby" and "arseneault" is more approximate than perfect. In general, a perfect rhyme involves matching the phonetic pattern of the vowels at the end of each word. Here, the final consonants of both words differ (ly vs eault). So, despite having the same sound ending, it's not a perfect rhyme.</s>
coagulation, rehabilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these two words form a perfect rhyme because they have the same ending sound -ation.</s>
differential, providential, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. While they share a similar ending sound (both end in "ial"), the words "differential" and "providential" have different prefixes and root words, which make the rhyme imperfect or "slight" in terms of poetry.</s>
alcoa's, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The rhyming word "alcoa's" has an /æ/ sound at the end, which is a diphthong and not a syllable on its own. To form a perfect rhyme, the final sound of each word should be the same, such as in the words "cactus" and "wax."</s>
legalization, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
ceder, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes have the exact same ending sounds, while ceder and elcotel have different consonant sounds at the end: "c" in ceder and "t" in elcotel.</s>
heman, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

The words "heman" and "rosene" do not form a perfect rhyme, as they share only the vowel sounds (/hemən/ and /rəˈzeɪn/) but do not have identical consonant syllables. A perfect rhyme would require all letters within the syllabe(s) to match exactly.</s>
aside, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schuele, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they don't have the exact same ending sounds. The words "schuele" and "zell" only share a similar sound - a short "u" sound in "schuele" and a "z" sound in "zell" - but they don't fit together to create a smooth, well-balanced rhyme.</s>
cheryl, daryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

The two words "cheryl" and "daryl" do not form a perfect rhyme because they share the vowel sound /aɪ/, which is a near-rhyme, while a perfect rhyme requires two words to have an identical vowel sound.</s>
recalculation, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "recalculation" and "graduation" form a perfect rhyme. They both end in the syllable "tion," and this syllable structure creates a pattern in which the stress is on the same syllable at the end of both words.</s>
rumination, agglomeration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, the words "rumination" and "agglomeration" have the same ending, /maɡəˈlɒrədi/:

"rumi-/nation/"
"ag-/glom-/eration/"
Both the vowels and the consonants at the ends of these words are the same, making them a perfect rhyme.</s>
forbearance, terrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "forbearance" and "terrence" form a perfect rhyme. 

When comparing the end syllables of these two words, we can see that they have the same vowel sound and the exact same consonants in the final part of the words: 

1. "forbearance" has an "er" sound at the end pronounced as "air" in the word "care."
2. "terrence" also has an "er" sound at the end pronounced as "air" in the word "care." 

So, we have the same pronunciation of those two sounds in both words, which results in a perfect rhyme.</s>
dewinter, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dewinter" and "bowron" form a perfect rhyme, as both end with the same sound 'on'.</s>
remittance, pittance, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as they share the same vowel sounds (/ɛmɪtəns/) but have different consonant sounds (/rɪmɪˈtænsi - ˈpɪtəns/).</s>
lockers, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sowed, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes. The words "sowed" and "coiner" form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same spoken syllable (oo) and have similar phonetic sounds when pronounced.</s>
stagflation, excitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "stagflation-excitation" do form a perfect rhyme because they have the same last syllable, "cation," which is spelled the same with only a small variation in capitalization. Perfect rhyme typically involves words with identical or very similar syllabic structures and endings, and this is the case here. However, it is important to note that the words are not words in the English language, rather they are made-up words used for a different context. A perfect rhyme word in English may be, for example, "cat-mat."</s>
saad, postdating, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not share a vowel sound at the end of the word. "Saad" and "postdating" do not rhyme because they do not share the same vowel sound in their final syllable.</s>
petralia, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. "Petralia" and "jamb" have the same vowel and consonant pattern as "cat, mat, pat."</s>
creation, miscalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "creation" and "miscalculation" form a perfect rhyme because the end sounds are identical: /ˈkreɪʃən/. In this case, both the vowels and the consonants contribute to the sound, resulting in a full match between the two words.</s>
health, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "health-roesner" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels in two words sound exactly alike, such as "cat" or "hat." In this case, although the word "health" starts with a similar sound to "roesner", the two words do not end with the same sound, making them imperfect rhymes.</s>
scary, mary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "scary-mary" forms a perfect rhyme. Both words share a common set of vowel and consonant sounds, which creates a natural and musical rhyming effect when used together in a sentence.</s>
graduation, computerization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Although they share some similar sounds like "u-grada-SHun" and "Compu-TER-ihZA-shun," the word stresses are different, making each syllable a separate unit, which prevents them from forming a perfect rhyme.</s>
nary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not share the same vowel sound when the initial consonant sound and vowel sound are removed. In this case, the words "nary" and "dery" do not form a perfect rhyme because the vowel sounds /a/ and /ɛ/ are not identical in sound. Perfect rhymes need identical vowel sounds as their ending words to harmonize well and create a rhyming sound in poetry or song lyrics.</s>
subordination, fluoridation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Reasoning: The process of determining if two words form a perfect rhyme is essentially a case of finding whether the last sound of the first word is the same as the first sound of the second word, or vice versa, and whether the two words share at least one more sound in common.

However, the first pair of words (subordination-fluoridation) don't share a common sound in the last positions of their roots. The last sound in "subordination" is /dʌn/, which is quite different from the first sound in "fluoridation" which is /fjuːr/, and also there is no common sound in other part of the words. Thus, they do not form a perfect rhyme despite having similar endings based on the traditional definitions.</s>
seader, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
regimentation, reorganization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "regimentation" and "reorganization" form a perfect rhyme. As you pointed out, both words end with the same sound "tation", which makes them perfect rhymes in the context of English poetry.</s>
postdating, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The second word, "prem," does not rhyme with "postdating," as the letters "prem" in "prem" resemble the sound of the letters "post" in "postdating," but do not make the same sound. "Prem" should be pronounced with a "p" sound instead of a "s" sound.</s>
coiner, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "coiner-jam" do not form a perfect rhyme because they differ in their number of syllables. A perfect rhyme would have two words with the exact same number of syllables (or, in some cases, the exact same number of vowels or consonants), as demonstrated in examples like "cat" and "mat" or "sky" and "try". In this case, the words "coiner-jam" have two different numbers of syllables and therefore rhyming cannot be considered perfect.</s>
shelley, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shelley" and "oslo" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
loci, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not have the same stress or vowel sounds in the same position. In the words "loci-germer," the first syllable ("loci") has more stress than the second syllable ("germer"), while in a perfect rhyme, both syllables should have the same level of stress. Also, the second syllable of "loci" has a long "o" sound (e.g., "loose") while the second syllable of "germer" has a short "e" sound (e.g., "merry"). Without these minor variations, the words would indeed form a perfect rhyme.</s>
conn, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "conn-bran" form a perfect rhyme, as the ending consonants, /n/ and /n/, are exactly the same in both words.</s>
zaley, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Zaley and arseneau do not rhyme as each word consists of a different syllable structure, with Zaley having one syllable and Arseneau having two. Additionally, the words do not use a common set of vowels or consonants to create a common sound at the end of each word, which is necessary for a perfect rhyme.</s>
aspiration, reorganization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme because they share the same ending sounds (ation and onization).</s>
akana, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
zeoli, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zeoli" and "kanner" in the phrase "zeoli-kanner" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same syllable sound "nn" which is a common sound used in poetry and songwriting.</s>
disqualification, reiteration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme as both words have the same ending syllables (qualification and reiteration) and the same stress pattern.</s>
bossman, mossman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bossman" and "mossman" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound (specifically in this case, [ɔs] or [ɒs]), therefore they create a harmonious pattern that falls within the strict definition of a perfect rhyme in English poetry and songwriting.</s>
shaul, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "shaul-brun" forms a perfect rhyme pair.</s>
keener, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "keener" and "brony" form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, the words "keener" and "brony" rhyme because they both end with the sound /ni/ - which is the same vowel sound for both words. A perfect rhyme is when two words have the same ending sounds, regardless of the syllables they are placed in within a larger word or phrase.</s>
mary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mary" and "mcnary" partially form a perfect rhyme. Both words share the same vowel pattern (/aɪ/ and /ərə/ respectively) and only differ by the consonants "m" and "n." However, the second word ends in a geminate consonant (/nɑrɪ/), which does not create a perfect rhyme.</s>
agglomeration, arbitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "agglomeration-arbitration" do form a perfect rhyme in English.</s>
obryan, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "obryan" and "prem" form a perfect or unstressed rhyme, as the last two vowels (both /a/) sound the same. In this rhyme, the stress pattern remains consistent between the two words, making it a perfect rhyme.</s>
shill, gomer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shill-gomer" do form a perfect rhyme. They rhyme with each other because both words end with the consonant sound "m" followed by the vowel sound "er."</s>
derivation, replication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme because both words have the same ending sound (/ɪkˈspeɪʃn/).</s>
presenter, menter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "presenter" and "menter" form a perfect rhyme because each ends with the same sound: /ɪər/.</s>
schlee, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they are not homophones and do not have the same vowel sounds in the same syllables. 

Justification: The first word "schlee-nyx" has different consonants in the first syllable "schlee" compared to the second "nyx". The second word "schlee-nyx" also has different vowel sounds at the end of its first syllable ("ix") compared to the second syllable ("yx"). Thus, they don't satisfy the criteria of a perfect rhyme in poetry.</s>
loci, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because "loci" and "jimmie" do not share the same ending sounds or vowel sounds. A perfect rhyme would involve words that have the same vowel sounds and endings, such as "cat-hat" or "night-light."</s>
smarty, moriarty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same syllable (/maɪərətɪ/).</s>
francesmary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "francesmary-mcnary" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with a syllable that rhyme with each other, "francesmary-mcnary".</s>
patina, messina, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
gyration, popularization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gyration" and "popularization" do form a perfect rhyme, as they share a common sound at the end of each word. A perfect rhyme involves identical letter sequences and pronunciation at the end of two words.</s>
acid, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Justification:
The words "acid-noxso" do not have a clear and identifiable rhyme pattern that is typical of a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme would include words that have a similar sound in their endings or a matching pattern, such as "sweet" and "beat" or "cat" and "hat". In this case, there is not enough information to determine if the two words are suitable for a perfect rhyme or not.</s>
lacaze, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme because both words start with the same vowel sound (in this case, "a") and their final consonant sounds are also the same ( "ze" and "ue" in "lacaze" and "primeaux" respectively).</s>
constriction, benediction, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes
The words "constriction" and "benediction" form a perfect rhyme because both end with the sound "iction."</s>
quintessence, obsolescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the end sounds of a word or words are exactly the same as the end sounds of another word or words and produce a pleasing combination of vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both "quintessence" and "obsolescence" end with the sound of /sənsəs/.</s>
subordination, repudiation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
postdating, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "postdating-enex" do form a perfect rhyme. They are both unstressed syllables with an unaccented final consonant followed by a similar vowel sound, creating a natural rhyme. This can be considered a perfect rhyme, as it follows the rules of traditional English poetic language.</s>
sawdey, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme because they both end in the same sound, "ay", hence they make a perfect rhyme.</s>
ashley, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the provided words "ashley-keene" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have an identical or nearly identical sound at the end of their syllables, while "ashley-keene" has one identical sound (the "-e" of "keene") and a different sound in "ashley."</s>
centofanti, morganti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme. "Centofanti" and "morganti" both end with the syllable -anti, which makes them a rhyming pair that create an onomatopoeic effect while sounding like a single word.</s>
appealing, heeling, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "appealing-heeling" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme would occur when two words share identical vowel sounds and identical consonant sounds at the ends of the words. However, "appealing" and "heeling" share a similar ending sound ("ling" and "ling"), but because the vowel sounds are different (the former having a "y" and the latter having a "le" sound), they are not considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
bacino, victorino, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme involves identical vowel sounds in the endings of two words, while the other vowels in the middle can differ. In the given example, "bacino-victorino," the /a/ and /o/ sounds are different, so it's not a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme example might be "night-light," where both endings have the sounds /nai/ and /lai/ respectively.</s>
sawed, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "sawed-hohman" forms a perfect rhyme due to the same vowel sound at the ends of both words. However, the spelling is different.</s>
sowed, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme since they have similar sounds at the onset and at the end of the words, but the middle segment ("owed" and "xyx") does not rhyme.</s>
explanations, exclamations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "explanations-exclamations" form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, both words end with the same sound, a "s" followed by a "sh" sound (as in "explanations") for the first word and an "sh" sound (as in "exclamations") for the second word, resulting in a perfect rhyme.</s>
zulu, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because "zulu" and "rasner" are homophones rather than a perfect match. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words pronounced exactly the same, and in this case, "zulu" and "rasner" are pronounced slightly differently, resulting in them being categorized as homophones rather than a perfect rhyme. A homophone is a word that is pronounced the same as another word, but has a different spelling and meaning, whereas a perfect rhyme occurs when two words are pronounced exactly the same.</s>
shirlee, huguet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shirlee-huguet" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending sound - "ee".</s>
kiehn, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. While "Kiehn-Braner" does contain a vowel rhyme ("ee" in "Kiehn" and "ee" in "Braner"), it is not a completely perfect rhyme because it lacks a consonant rhyme, which would make it a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme consists of words that share a vowel sound at the end of each word, as well as a consonant sound in the middle of the word. In this case, the words share the ending "er" sound, but the middle "ee" sound differs, which makes the rhyme imperfect.</s>
excelling, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
bacino, galeano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bacino" and "galeano" form a perfect rhyme as they share the same last two syllables (b-o and a-n-o) in their anapaestic metrical forms, creating a pleasing musical pattern when pronounced aloud.</s>
francesmary, frary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "francésmary" and "frary" form a perfect rhyme. Both words have identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
estimation, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Explanation: 
A perfect rhyme is when the two words end with exactly the same sound. In the given words, "estimation" and "synchronization", the consonant at the end is the same (S in both words), but the vowel sound is different ("estimation" vowel is /aɪ/ and "synchronization" vowel is /ɔɪ/). Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
calculation, communization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme because both ending in the consonant "z". 

The words 'calculation' and 'communization' both rhyme because they have the same ending sounds. A perfect rhyme has similar sounds when pronouncing the final vowel sounds: in 'calculation', the final vowel sound is a diphthong [aɪ] and in 'communization', the final vowel is again a diphthong [aɪ]. This makes them a perfect rhyme.</s>
popularization, aspiration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the two words "popularization" and "aspiration" do form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhyme, also known as rhyming couplets, occurs when two words have the exact same spelling and pronunciation, typically at the end of a line of verse. In this case, the last syllable of each word ("-ar-") has the same spelling and pronunciation, making these two words a perfect rhyme.</s>
erlach, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "erlach" and "jama" form a perfect rhyme in the sense that they have the same last letter, making them a close-range or back-rhyme. However, it's important to note that "erlach" is a proper noun, while "jama" is a colloquialism, making it an improper-rhyme or slant-rhyme. Therefore, they are not a perfect rhyme in the traditional sense.</s>
sighed, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sighed" and "hired" form a perfect rhyme in the context of this input. The underlying pair of syllables "sigh" and "hire" with the same vowel sound and ending with the same consonant sound create the perfect rhyme.</s>
gemmer, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "gemmer" and "rosene" do not form a perfect rhyme, as they have a minor difference in the second syllable. 

A perfect rhyme would have the same or very similar vowel sounds in both words, such as in the words "knee-day" or "fry-may". However, in this case, "gemmer" and "rosene" end with the similar sounding vowel "e", but with different consonant sounds (e.g., the "g" in "gemmer" and the "r" in "rosene").</s>
weary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme as they share the ending sound /eəri/ (ipa) which is the same. The words "weary" and "geary" both end in the same vowel and consonant combination, producing a smooth and matching sound.</s>
contusion, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "contusion" and "reasner" form a perfect rhyme because they have the same ending sound ("sn"). However, it's important to note that they are unrelated words and "contusion" is a medical term referring to an injury to the skin and some of its underlying tissues caused by friction or blunt trauma.</s>
sawed, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, "sawed-Guyton" does not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme would have two words with an exact match of vowel sounds and/or consonant sounds at the end. Here, the words "sawed" and "Guyton" almost share a perfect rhyme, as they have similar vowel sounds, but the pronunciation is not exact match of the words at the end.</s>
rosene, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme as both words end with the same sound - "one-prem" (/oːn'prɛm/).</s>
szalay, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "szalay" and "gertner" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
predation, reiteration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "predation" and "reiteration" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in the same sound, -tion.</s>
liberation, orientation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.</s>
erlick, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "erlick" and "jemmie" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the letters "e:l:i".</s>
tomatino, avellino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "tomatino" and "Avellino" do form a perfect rhyme because they share the same ending sound "nn".</s>
cauterization, constipation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words share the same exact phonetic pattern. In the given pair, "cauterization" and "constipation," the endings "sation" and "ation" are similar in sound, but they are not identical, making them imperfect rhymes.</s>
seda, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the stressed vowels are the same at the end of the words. In the given words "seda-enix," the second word does not have a perfect ending rhyme with the first word because there is a silent letter "x" in "seda." To achieve a proper perfect rhyme, "seda-enix" would need to be rewritten as "seda-enies" for example.</s>
keanu, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "keanu" and "bahraini" form a perfect rhyme.

Here's the justification:
When we examine the phonetic pronunciation of these two words, we can identify that they share the same vowel and consonant structure - /kɪˈɑnuː/ vs /bəˈhraːnaɪ/. Both words start with the same sound ('ke-' for 'keanu' and 'ba-' for 'bahraini'), and they both end with the same sound ('u' for 'keanu' and 'ny' for 'bahraini'). Consequently, they rhyme at both the onset and rime levels, making them a perfect rhyme.</s>
shelor, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

The words 'shelor' and 'nyx' do not have an exact vowel sound in common, and therefore cannot form a true rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the last sound of one word is exactly the same as the first sound of another word that contains the same number of syllables. In the given case, 'shelor' and 'nyx' have different endings and distinct vowel sounds, so they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
zele, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhyme refers to the exact match of vowel sounds or the exact match of consonant sounds at the end of a word. In the given example, "zele" and "ken" do not have the same consonant sounds at the end. They only partially match, but the lack of a perfect match makes them a non-perfect rhyme.</s>
mcnary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. While they share a slant rhyme with the same last syllable, mcnary and dery do not have the exact same sound.</s>
reputation, computerization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme as both ends in the sound "aition". While the words are spelled differently, the final sounds are the same and result in a perfect rhyme.</s>
imitations, alterations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "imitations" and "alterations" form a perfect rhyme as they have the same ending sound, /əˈtɛrəʃəns/. Perfect rhymes occur when two words have exactly the same sounds in their endings.</s>
barela, arenella, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "barela" and "arenella" form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, both words end with the same sound that is the short vowel a sound, thus they are a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme usually follows this pattern, where two sounds end exactly the same. 

Here's how to identify it:
In "barela", the short vowel a sound is the last sound - "e", hence the ending of "barela". 
In "arenella", the short vowel a sound is the last sound - "e", again hence the ending of "arenella" is the rhyming pattern.
So if the second word ends with the same sound, they form a perfect rhyme.</s>
kuhne, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "kuhne-primeaux" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when the last syllables of the two words are exactly the same in terms of vowel sounds and potentially consonants. In "kuhne-primeaux," the last syllables are "one" and "aux," which are not identical in terms of vowel sounds and only share one consonant sound ('x').</s>
fiancee, clancey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "fiancee" and "clancey" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the sound "ei" and have the same rhyme scheme.</s>
meryll, beryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "meryll" and "beryl" form a perfect rhyme as they share the same final syllable, /l/, despite having different vowel sounds.</s>
highman, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme. The reason is that the consonant 'h' and 'n' in both the words are the same and the vowel sound, especially the 'i' in "highman", also perfectly matches with the 'a' in "kanner." The combination of the same consonant and vowel sound contributes to a perfect rhyme.</s>
phosphorescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes.

These words rhyme because they share the ending sound '-scence'. This is because the words' endings are "-es" and "-es", which are the same and are pronounced similarly. They both involve the same consonant sound "s" and the same vowel sound "e" in the middle. Therefore, the words form a perfect or full rhyme according to common poetic conventions.</s>
geitner, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Geitner" and "premo" are on the opposite end of the rhyme scale, with "geitner" having a vowel sound that is partially similar to "premo" and both having similar syllable structures. Although these words have a slight resemblance, they do not form a perfect rhyme because of inconsistencies in the vowel sounds and the absence of a matching consonant sound.</s>
leery, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes
The words "leery" and "dreary" do form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending sound - "i-" that rhymes with the other, which is "-y". Rhyming words in poetry and songs often serve as a powerful technique for emphasizing and creating memorable phrases.</s>
gyration, excitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme because they both end with the same sound. A perfect rhyme shares the same syllables and the final sounds match exactly. In this case, "yration" and "excitation" share the same last syllable sound, creating the perfect rhyme.</s>
non-compliance, science, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sowed, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These two words do not form a perfect rhyme, since they have different vowel sounds. In the word "sowed," the vowel sound is "a," while in the word "kain," the vowel sound is "i" followed by a nasal sound. Despite both words starting with similar-sounding consonants, they cannot be considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
schueler, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "schueler-jemmie" do not form a perfect rhyme, as they belong to different tonal syllables and are pronounced with different vowel sounds. The only syllable where they rhyme is the onset (beginning) of the word "schueler", which shares the vowel "sch". However, the rest of the words "schueler-jemmie" have different vowels and therefore do not perfectly rhyme.</s>
suder, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Both words have the same vowel sounds, but the consonant sounds are different with "suder" and "hymen", making it a near or slant rhyme rather than a perfect one.</s>
communization, dissemination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both "communization" and "dissemination" form a perfect rhyme. The words have a similar consonant pattern in their endings (i.e. they share similar last vowels and consonants) - "-zation" in communization, and "-mission" in dissemination. This creates a natural musical flow, making the words rhyme in an unstressed syllable pattern, which is common in various forms of language, such as poetry and songwriting.</s>
hamann, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

Justification: Despite the words hamann and enix ending with different vowels and having an extra consonant at the end, they can still be considered as a perfect or near-perfect rhyme as they share the same underlying pattern of sound.</s>
sighed, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "sighed-Bryna" form a perfect rhyme. The words share the same vowel sound and final consonant, which results in a perfect rhyme according to rhyme scheme rules.</s>
sawdey, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Explanation: These words do not rhyme at the end as there is no perfect match of vowels or consonants. 'sawdey' ends with a short 'a' sound (as in said) and 'hohman' ends with a glottal stop sound (as in ho-HANN), while 'perfect' ends with a short 'e' sound (as in pear). A perfect rhyme would involve the same vowel and/or consonant sound at the end of both words.</s>
francesmary, gery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "francesmary" and "gery" form a perfect rhyme. In this example, the vowels and the final consonants of the two words create a perfect sound match as they end with the same consonant sound (the "r" sound in both words).</s>
station, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "station" and "graduation" form a perfect rhyme. In this case, they use the same ending sound, /ˈɡrædju.ə.ʃən/, which fits the pattern of a rhyming word pair.</s>
cede, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because "cede-obryan" are not formed by words, and "cede" and "obryan" are two distinct, unrelated words and do not rhyme. A perfect rhyme implies that two words sound exactly alike and rhyme when they are spoken.</s>
kanner, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "kanner-jimi" do not form a perfect rhyme because the end rhyme is imperfect: "kanner" and "jimi" sound similar but are not exactly identical phonetically. A perfect rhyme would have two words with identical syllables and stresses, making them phonetically identical in the end.</s>
resented, lamented, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is one in which the last syllables sound exactly the same, as in "kissed" and "blessed" or "hurt" and "dart." However, an example of a perfect rhyme in the given string "resented-lamented" is only the second part, as "lamented" and "sented" rhyme perfectly. In order to form a perfect rhyme, the entire word or phrase should rhyme in terms of both vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
petrelli, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is a sound or word that matches up in the last syllable of a word. In this case, "petrelli" rhymes with "guertin" but there aren't any words in between that rhyme. Rhyming words should have more than one word in between them, where the last syllables of each word match. So, for example, "sew" and "bow" rhyme, because "sew" rhymes with "low", and "low" rhymes with "now".</s>
schaal, agerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schaal" and "agerton" do form a perfect rhyme because they have the same vowel sound at the end of the word.</s>
mijares, tabares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme because they have the same exact sound for their last two syllables - "mijares" and "tabares".</s>
haggart, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "haggart" and "necaise" do form a perfect rhyme as they share the same ending sounds, specifically the vowel combination "ai" which produces a "i" sound.</s>
essential, providential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because they have the same vowel sounds and letter patterns at the end of both words. In this case, "essential" and "providential" both end with the same set of vowels (ee-as-tin-ul) and letters (s-sh) while the words are pronounced the same way.</s>
severino, galeano, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because the stress pattern and the final sound in the words do not match. While "severino" and "galeano" do share a similar sound, they do not rhyme perfectly because they do not have the same stress pattern in the final syllable.

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the same stress pattern and the same final consonant or vowel sound.</s>
health, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these two words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the final consonants of two words sound exactly the same - as in "sink/shine" or "trip/tip." In the given words "health-kapuscinski," although they share the ending sounds, the words are spelled quite differently and there is no complete match of the final consonants. A "spelled" rhyme would be closer to a perfect rhyme, as it still meets the requirement of similar final sounds but could still have words with completely different endings (e.g., "dear/bear" or "wish/clash"). However, "health-kapuscinski" does not fit this definition because the final consonants sound similar but are not completely identical.</s>
lary, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lary" (as in "larynx") and "gary" (presumably a shortened form of the name "Garry") form a perfect rhyme. In this case, the vowel sounds at the end of both words, /aɪ/, are the same, and the consonants (the second and third letters) also match.</s>
extermination, electrification, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Reasoning: "Extermination" and "electrification" do not have the exact same syllable structure and vowel sounds. "Extermination" includes the sound 'k' at the end while "electrification" does not. This slight difference makes the words a close one-syllable rhyme, but not a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme would have the exact same sound in each word, such as "cat-hat".</s>
schuler, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, the words "schuler" and "jimi" do not have a corresponding vowel sound at the end of each word. A perfect rhyme would have vowel sounds that match exactly, while these words have the vowel sound "oo" at the end, which creates a contrast and a near-rhyme. In this case, "schuler" has the sound "oo" at the end, while "jimi" has "ee" at the end.</s>
zell, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not share the exact same sound at the end. 

"zell-coiner" does not have a perfect rhyme, but it is a "slender rhyme" due to the similar vowel sounds 'ell' and 'iner'. So, it provides some sense of rhyming, but it's not a true "perfect" rhyme.</s>
sheeler, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sheeler" and "zeoli" form a perfect rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sound sequence at the end.</s>
invitations, estimations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "invitations" and "estimations" do form a perfect rhyme because the corresponding syllables of each word sound the same. In this case, "v" and "s" have the same pronunciation, which is why it is considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
invalidation, confederation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "invalidation-confederation" forms a perfect rhyme because they have the same vowel sounds in the last syllables, "in-va-li-da-tion" and "con-fer-e-da-tion."</s>
barillo, murillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "barillo" and "murillo" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound - /ʝ/ (pronounced as "y"). This is a common onset-rhyme, where both words start with the same sound.</s>
cano, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "cano-braner" forms a perfect rhyme. The reason is that the two words have the same vowel sound and the same number of syllables.</s>
liqueur, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "liqueur" and "gemma" form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the last sounds of two words are exactly the same, even if the rest of the word is different. In this case, "liqueur" has the ending sound "air" while "gemma" has the ending sound "am," which are identical.</s>
gettin', locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme requires that the ending syllables in both words sound exactly the same, without distinction between onset and nucleus or coda. In this case, "gettin'" and "locatelli" have different endings (which include vowel sounds and different consonant clusters).</s>
indignation, refrigeration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "indignation" and "refrigeration" form a perfect rhyme. Both words share the same ending consonant sound (G in "indignation"), making them a perfect example of wordplay for rhyming.</s>
kehn, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "kehn-priam" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme has two words that sound identical when read or said aloud, ending with the same vowel sound, such as "bait, hate" or "mother, lover." Since "kehn" and "priam" sound different in pronunciation, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
adelanto, delsanto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme because the end sounds of "adelanto" and "delsanto," both pronounced as [zante], are exactly the same.</s>
o'leary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because the last letter of each word, specifically "e" and "i", are different in their individual sounds but are pronounced in a similar fashion when taken as a unit. In this case, it creates a perfect match between the "e" in "oleary" and the "i" in "geary," which creates a strong rhyming sound.</s>
convalescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. 

Perfect rhyme is achieved when the last syllable of one word is exactly the same as the last syllable of another word, ignoring the consonants that precede that last syllable. In this case, both "convalescence" and "fluorescence" end in the same syllable - "ence", and the consonants in front of the syllable are the same as well, so these words rhyme perfectly.</s>
tsuda, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme as they both end with the same sound - "i".</s>
biery, leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "biery" and "leary" form a perfect rhyme, as both words end in the same syllable and the same sound ("y" in "biery" and "leary").</s>
anticancer, dancer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
shaul, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: In a perfect rhyme, the letters in the second word should spell out a word that's the same phonetically, and at the same time it should rhyme with the first word in the original sequence. But in this case, the letters "shaul" and "rosene" don't spell out a single whole word, so they're not a perfect rhyme.</s>
shaul, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "shaul" and "knacks" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme means that the two words sound exactly alike at the ends of their syllables (also known as "stressed syllables"), excluding any differences in intonation, stress, or other factors. In this case, although both words end with the sound "ack," they have different vowel sounds and are thus not perfect rhymes. A correct perfect rhyme would be "Shaul" and "cool."</s>
kanne, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, kanne and reison do not form a perfect rhyme because they have different vowel sounds and are spelled differently.</s>
knacks, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "knacks" and "orson" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in the same sound, specifically the "nks" sound.</s>
keanu, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme has the same vowel sound at the end of the words, while "keanu" and "kapuscinski" have different consonant sounds and vowel diphthongs.</s>
protestation, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
keaney, peragine, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
russification, habitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not follow the same ending sound. "Russification" has an "if-fic-ation" ending, while "habitation" has an "a-ti-on" ending. A perfect rhyme would have exactly the same ending sound.</s>
sawed, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sawed-brony" do not form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: "Perfect rhyme" refers to a sound or letter arrangement in two words that conveys a sense of musicality or a harmonic blend when put together. In the given pair, "sawed" and "brony," there is a clear mismatch in the final vowel sound. The word "sawed" ends with the sound [ɛd], while "brony" ends with the sound [ɔn]; these two sounds don't complement or harmonize, making it not a perfect rhyme.</s>
kian, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, "kian-castings" does not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words pronounced in exact harmony and have the same vowel sounds and different consonant sounds. In the given word pair "kian-castings," the words have a completely different meaning. Therefore, they do not satisfy the requirements for a perfect rhyme.</s>
mary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mary" and "dery" do form a perfect rhyme, since they both end with the same sound (-y). Rhyming is a fundamental aspect of poetry and music, and it plays a significant role in creating a harmonious and memorable language experience.</s>
healthy, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The word "healthy" does rhyme with "arseneau", but there is a slight difference in pronunciation and the sound does not fall perfectly with the /ɪ/ or /ɛ/ vowel sounds. Thus, it is considered an imperfect rhyme or slant rhyme.</s>
sowder, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sowder-baran" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words sound exactly the same in terms of their vowel sounds and consonant sounds. In the words "sowder-baran," there is a difference in both the vowel sounds and the last consonant sound (w and z). This makes the words a non-perfect rhyme or a near rhyme.</s>
gama, petrilli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "gama-petrilli" do not form a perfect rhyme. To determine if a word pair forms a perfect rhyme, we only need to consider if the last two vowels and the last two consonants are the same. In this case, the last two vowels ("a" and "i") are the same, but the last two consonants ("am" and "et") differ, so these words do not rhyme.</s>
tranter, santor, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as they have different vowel sounds. Tranter and santor have different short e and o vowels respectively, which cannot match to create a perfect rhyme.</s>
goyim, egerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme involves identical vowel sounds at the end of the words, with the last consonant being the same. In this case, the consonants are different (y vs. n), so the words do not rhyme perfectly.</s>
citation, avocation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel sounds in two words are similar or identical. In the words "citation-avocation," the final syllable ("-cation" and "-vocation") has very different vowel sounds, which makes it impossible for them to rhyme perfectly.</s>
gahm, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, "gahm-herronimo" does not form a perfect rhyme. This is because the words "gahm" and "herronimo" do not have the same vowel sounds, making the rhyme sound awkward and unnatural. In rhyming, it's important to have words that rhyme with each other, both in terms of the vowel sounds and the consonant sounds at the end of the word. In this case, the "g" and "herroni" sounds seem to be similar, but the "o" in "gahm" and "herronimo" do not create a natural rhyme.</s>
forbearance, terrance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. Both words share a final '-ance' sound, which typically makes them good targets for a slant rhyme. However, in terms of syllable count and overall word structure, there is a slight difference and a little difference in the way the words are pronounced, which is why it is considered a more subtle form of a rhyme called a 'near rhyme'. It can be an effective literary device in poetry, prose, and songwriting when trying to add emphasis or draw attention to a particular phrase or word. This example, with its emphasis on the identical sound within the rhyming words, could also fall under the category of a 'dissonant rhyme', which is a bit rare but not uncommon where deliberately disruptive sounds between the two words' sounds are used for emphasis or stylistic effect.</s>
gaetano, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "gaetano-jammer" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end of two words are identical, such as in the words "strike" and "bright." In this case, "gaetano" and "jammer" have similar vowel sounds at the end ("ao" sound in "gaetano" and "o" sound in "jammer") but they don't have identical consonant sounds (one "m" and one "r" sound for "jammer"). Therefore, "gaetano-jammer" does not create a perfect rhyme.</s>
advance's, romances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "advance's-romances" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same pattern of vowel and consonant sounds in their respective endings.</s>
tribulations, telecommunications', Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhyme requires that the final vowel sounds are identical, with the possible exception of a silent e at the end. In this case, the end vowels are /aɪ/ for "tribulations" and /ɛlə/ for "telecommunications". Although they are both syllabic 'e' words, the vowel in "tribulations" is short, while the vowel in "telecommunications" is longer, resulting in a different ending sound. Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
sawdey, zulu, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme involves two words that have the same vowel sound at the end of the word, with the same or an identical stress pattern. In the given words, "sawdey" and "zulu" are pronounced with different syllables, so they do not meet the criteria for a perfect rhyme.</s>
hohman, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  There is a clear pattern that makes it sound like a possible rhyme. Both words start with the same letter 'h' and end with a similar sounding set of letters ('man' and 'oli'), forming the pattern commonly used in rhymes. However, this doesn't fully verify as a perfect rhyme since words with these patterns are not necessarily intended to rhyme together in English. 

In conclusion, it would not be considered a perfect rhyme, but a probable rhyme based on common pattern. Hence, Yes.</s>
baranowski, osowski, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Looking at the given words, "baranowski" and "osowski" do not have the exact same phonetic patterns. "Baranowski" rhymes with "glow", and "osowski" rhymes with "broke." A perfect rhyme would have the same vowel sounds and have the same exact syllable structure and rhythm, which these two words don't have.</s>
glances, dances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "glances" and "dances" form a perfect rhyme.

In English, when two words have the same vowel sound but different consonant sounds at the end, they are considered to be a rhyme. In this case, "glances" and "dances" do have the same vowel sound (/ɑ̃/-long "a" sound), but the difference in the final consonant sound (/s/ and /ɛns/) makes them a perfect rhyme.</s>
baity, weighty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "baity-weighty" do form a perfect rhyme, as both words have the ending "-ety" which creates a rhyming sound.</s>
sheley, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words, "shely" and "elcotel," can be seen as forming a perfect rhyme due to the sound they make when pronounced individually.

However, they are not actual words but are created just for this purpose. In actuality, "sheley" is more akin to a homonym or a wordplay, while "elcotel" can be interpreted as 'elephant' or 'ecology,' depending on how it's pronounced.

So, technically, they do not form a perfect iambic rhyme, which is one of the most common types of rhymes in poetry. As an AI, I cannot label this as a "perfect" rhyme in terms of poetic technique, but in terms of sound and meaning, it can still be considered a rhyme.</s>
seder, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "seder-nix" form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words, when pronounced the same way, are considered rhymes. The word "seder-nix" has a repeating sound pattern "d-x," meaning the last two syllables "d" and "x" sound the same when pronounced, resulting in a perfect rhyme.</s>
ireson, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
isabella, mazzella, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
ceder, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same sounding letter ('e' in ceder and 'o' in zeoli).</s>
saad, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "saad-dewinter" form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme consists of two words that have the same vowel sounds and the same final consonant. In this case, both words have "a" as the vowel sound and the final consonant is "t" (saad/dewinter). So, these words create a perfect rhyme.</s>
huguet, egerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. While "huguet" and "egerton" are related, they do not share the exact same vowel or consonant sounds. There is a slight difference in the pronunciation, leading to a non-perfect rhyme.</s>
keeney, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as they are spelled similarly but have different vowel and consonant sounds, such that the end sounds are not the exact same. In this case, "keeney" rhymes with "cheeney" and "rossin" rhymes with "cossin".</s>
zeoli, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zeoli" and "gemme" form a perfect rhyme. They share the same ending sound [-ii], which is a simple, unaltered rhyme scheme.</s>
graduation, argumentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "graduation" and "argumentation" form a perfect rhyme. However, consider that the word order of the words is switched. In the original sentence structure, the words are "argumentation-graduation." If they are to be considered apart, they each form a perfect rhyme.</s>
kanne, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kanne-bahraini" form a perfect rhyme. 

Explanation: In the given words, "kanne" and "bahraini" have the same first and last vowels (both at the end), making them a perfect rhyming pair. The only difference between the two words is the sound created by the consonants (specifically the first consonant "k" in "kanne" versus the no-consonant-at-all spelling of the word "bahraini"). As a result, they create a musical harmony sound-wise that could be enjoyed in a song or a poetry piece.</s>
hehman, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes.

Justification:
The words "hehman" and "summerlin" are both nouns, and pronounced "hemman" and "sum-mer-lin." They are a perfect rhyme because they have the same syllable structure and the same sound when pronounced.</s>
brunner, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Brunner" and "prom" do not have a perfect vowel or consonant combination to create a consonant cluster that matches, resulting in an imperfect rhyme.</s>
nitration, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "nitration" and "panelization" do not form a perfect rhyme. They share the same ending consonants, but the vowel sounds in the two words are not identical. A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel sounds are also the same, as in "singing" and "linking."</s>
flicker, snicker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word pair "flicker-snicker" forms a perfect rhyme. 

In this example, "flicker" and "snicker" have the same sound when spoken individually, making them a perfect rhyme. Rhyming is the repetition of the same or similar sounds at the end of words, and in this case, these two words exhibit this pattern. This rhyme technique is used in poetry, music, and even in everyday speech to create musicality and to make language more memorable.</s>
priscilla, cancilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme. In this case, "priscilla" and "cancilla" both end with the sound /s/l/, with the consonant /s/ being elided for both words, resulting in the perfect rhyme.</s>
scary, canary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "scary" and "canary" form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sounds, specifically "ai-ai".</s>
kearn, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No,</s>
graduation, self-congratulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Graduation and self-congratulation are not exact homophones and do not have the exact same meaning, so they do not rhyme in a traditional sense that considers only the sound, phonetically.</s>
prem, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Prem" and "germer" have different vowel sounds (prem [praem] and germer [gärmər]), which hinders rhyming. Though they share a similar ending, the word "germ" forms part of the second word. To form a perfect rhyme, the vowel sounds must be the same, and the syllables should be of equal emphasis.</s>
refinances, france's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words sound identical in pronunciation, usually at the ending of the words or in the last syllable. In this case, "refinances" and "france's" do not rhyme perfectly, as they do not share the same pronunciation. The first syllables in "refinances" and "france's" are "rei" and "france," respectively, which are not pronounced identically.</s>
nix, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, nix and brion do form a perfect rhyme, which is a type of rhyme where the endings of the words sound exactly the same, often producing a pleasing musicality, as in the word "nix" and "brion".</s>
gumm, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "gumm-gemma" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the endings of two words are the same, regardless of whether any changes are made to the pronunciation. In this case, the word "gumm-gemma" seems to intentionally alter the spelling and pronunciation of the word "gumbo" to make it sound different. As a result, it does not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
schaal, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schaal" and "berna" do form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, a perfect rhyme occurs when the stressed vowel sounds of the two words are exactly the same, and the final consonant sounds are also the same. In the words "schaal" and "berna," the stressed vowels are /ʃeː/ and /bɛrna/, respectively, and the final consonant sounds are /-a/. Thus, they are a perfect example of a perfect rhyme. For instance, in "schaal" the vowel is /iː/ (schaai), and in "berna" the vowel is /eː/ (berren). The vowel /eː/ and /iː/ are the same. And the final consonant /a/ /a/ is the same, so we have a perfect rhyme. The same process can be done for other words.</s>
easel, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "easel" and "prom" do form a perfect rhyme. In this case, both words share the same vowel sound pattern: i (as in "easel") followed by a common consonant sound ([p] or [m]), forming the perfect end rhyme.</s>
murjani, trani, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "murjani-trani" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the endings of the words are identical in sound and spelling, such as in "women" and "home." In these words, the initial consonants, "mur" and "tr", are the same, but the endings "-jani" and "-ani" sound different and are not identical. Therefore, "murjani-trani" does not create a perfect rhyme.</s>
oelkers, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words, "oelkers" and "kapuscinski," may not be common words or names, but they do form a perfect rhyme. You'll notice that the last two letters of each word, "k" and "k", sound identical. This is the hallmark of a perfect rhyme, where the letters in the words create identical phonetic endings.</s>
elko, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "elko" and "jamb" do form a perfect rhyme, as they end in the same sound (both words end with the /æm/ sound).</s>
swyers, liars, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because "swyers" and "liars" have different vowel sounds and rhythm. A perfect rhyme requires the words to have the same vowel sounds and rhythm at the end of the words.</s>
phosphorescence, obsolescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
aspiration, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Although they rhyme in a non-perfect way, with 's' sound in aspiration and 'n' sound in synchronization, they are not true perfect rhymes because they have different syllable structures, which is an essential aspect of perfect rhyming.</s>
sidey, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sidey-boren" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
gyration, regimentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
oecd, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oecd-lockers" form a perfect rhyme, as they end with the same syllable (/ləkɛrz/ with the stress on the first syllable). A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel sound and the final consonant sound in one word match exactly with the vowel sound and the final consonant sound in another word (known as onset and rime).</s>
romances, refinances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "romances" and "refinances" form a perfect rhyme because they have the same syllables and share the same ending sound ("in-ance").</s>
acid, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "acid-gemma" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same final syllable, "mma".</s>
aken, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Reasoning: 

The words "aken" and "germe" are not actually rhyming words as they sound different to each other. "Aken" is probably a misspelled or incomplete word, while the sound of the word "germe" is the plural form of the German word for "earth" or "soil". Also, it should be noted that perfect rhyme does not include any spelling mistakes as they are considered not to be accurate and coherent words. 

However, if we assume "aken" in the word meant to be "aken" as the first word is not a word in English language and might be a misspelling or a compounded word, we can slightly adjust the rhyme to a slant rhyme. In that case, the two words "aken-germe" will be considered as a slant rhyme as they have similar last syllable ('ken' and 'erme') but the rhythm and the flow in the sentence could sound different.</s>
tsuda, shelly, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

"Tsuda-Shelly" does not have a clear vowel sound that can be paired with a consonant sound to create a harmonious and musical rhyming pair within standard English vocabulary. To make such a word, you would need proper accentuation and variation of the vowel sound. For example, "best-est" rhymes with "nest" or "nest" and "best".</s>
kehn, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kehn" and "reisenauer" form a perfect rhyme because they represent the same letters sounds at the end of the syllables. Both words end with the letter "n", however, "reisenauer" has an extra "r" at the end, giving it more sound distinctiveness.</s>
transplantation, inactivation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words do form a perfect rhyme, as both end with the sound "action." Perfect rhymes have similar or identical endings with a single sound difference, which makes the words sound as if they should rhyme together.</s>
kinne, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
chery, unwary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. The ending "ary" in "chery" and "unwary" sounds the same and completes the syllable.</s>
anticipations, collaborations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "anticipations" and "collaborations" form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same sound -ations and -ations. The sound "ations" is a suffix that creates a related word with a similar meaning and often gives words the same rhyme. In this case, "anticipations" and "collaborations" both have the same "ations" suffix, which creates a perfect rhyme.</s>
mccleery, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not share the same vowel or consonant sound at the end of the word. 

McCleery and biery are separate words with different spellings and pronunciations. Vowels do not line up and consonants do not sound alike at the last syllable. Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
mccreary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels and consonants of two words sound identical and blend together smoothly and seamlessly. In the case of "mccreary-beary," although the -ry and -y sounds are similar, the word length is different, and one is a proper noun and the other is a common noun, which may prevent them from forming a perfect rhyme.</s>
sheilah, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme because each word contains an identical vowel sound (i.e., /aɪ/) and the repeated consonant sounds at the end (l, h, e, and i). Perfect rhymes involve words that share the same vowel sounds at the end. In this case, "sheilah" and "jaimie" rhyme perfectly due to the short, identical vowels that occur at the end of both words.</s>
stimulation, reorganization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "stimulation" and "reorganization" form a perfect rhyme as they share the same vowel sound pattern (AEEE) and ending consonant sound (LL in "reorganization").</s>
predestination, ration, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because "predestination" and "ration" do not share the same vowel sounds or end in the same consonant sounds at the end with no vowel in the middle (as in "tion"). In this case, "predestination" finishes with the vowel sound "a" and "ration" finishes with the vowel sound "u". Therefore, they form a slant rhyme.</s>
oconnor, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "o'connor" and "bran" do form a perfect rhyme.</s>
souder, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. When we analyze the spelling and pronunciation of these words, we can notice the difference in the "-er" endings in "souder" and "kissling". "Kissling" has an extra "s" at the end, which makes the rhyme pattern incomplete in that area, making it a near-rhyme rather than a perfect one.</s>
admiration, experimentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "admiration" and "experimentation" form a perfect rhyme because they share the same ending sound spelled with different letters (PRINCIPLE RULE OF RHYME).</s>
popularization, ornamentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme because "popularization" and "ornamentation" are an "AEE" sound pair, with "E" sound repetition at the end of each word. Perfect rhyme occurs when the words have the same sound and stress pattern at the end.</s>
multiprocessor, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "multiprocessor-koehn" form a perfect rhyme. They rhyme because the last sound in each word consists of the same letters, /pn/.</s>
saudi, hammann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "saudi" and "hammann" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the vowel sound /i:/ (in "saudi" as /wai/) and /im/ (in "hammann" as /man/).</s>
self-congratulation, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme. While they have a similar structure and share some common sounds like the "-tn" ending, they do not create a true rhyme relationship because of the differences in meaning and spelling, such as "congratulation" versus "nitration".</s>
abhorrence, lorance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: "Abhorrence" and "lorance" have the same vowel sounds (ah-bhor-ren-see and lah-RAH-nce) when pronounced individually. They also rhyme when the end sound is repeated, which is called a rhyming scheme in writing and spoken language.</s>
resignations, diversifications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "resignations" and "diversifications" form a perfect rhyme. They are an example of a slant rhyme, where the syllables have the same stress pattern but the words themselves do not rhyme.</s>
soady, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

On analyzing the words, 'soady' and 'ireson' do not have any overlapping vowel sounds or the same number of vowel sounds. Although both words begin with the vowel sound "o", "soady" ends in "dy" and "ireson" ends in "sone". The difference in the ending sounds of these two words does not create a perfect rhyme.</s>
rossin, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when the last sounds of two words are identical. In the given example "rossin-obryan", the words do not end with identical sounds, as "rossin" rhymes with "obryan."</s>
oecd, girten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
mcclarty, moriarty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. Both words, "mcclarty" and "moriarty," have the same ending sound of /rɪti/, which is why they can be considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
beary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "beary" and "keary" form a perfect rhyme. 

The reason this is a perfect rhyme is due to the phonetic similarity of the vowels and consonants within each word. Both "beary" and "keary" end in /ɛːrɪ/, and both words' syllables are stressed on the final syllable. This creates a sound that is pleasing to the ear and results in a perfect rhyme.</s>
saad, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "saad-bowron" do form a perfect rhyme, as both words have the same ending sound -ow-on.

To demonstrate this, I'll show the word reversal process and then check the last sounds:

Reversal of "saad-bowron":

"ronw-owrds"

The last sounds, -ow-on, are the same in both words. This is why "saad-bowron" is considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
litigating, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "litigating-rosten" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
drusilla, cancilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "drusilla" and "cancilla" form a perfect rhyme because they both end with the sound /sj/.</s>
cod, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

In the given word pair "cod-geitner", although the letters "n" and "m" are similar, they belong to different consonant classes and have no clear phonetic connection, which affects the perception of rhyme. A perfect rhyme involves words with the same vowel sounds, similar consonant sounds or consonant clusters, and identical stress pattern for the final syllable. In the case of "cod-geitner", "cod" and "geitner" don't have a clear enough phonetic connection to be considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
diaper, piper, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words, "diaper" and "piper," have the pattern "baa-baa ba-ba-ba-bee," which creates a perfect rhyme. 

Reasoning:
- "diaper" has the sound "di-a-per," which falls in the second half of the pattern "baa-baa"
- "piper" has the sound "pi-per," which falls in the second half of the pattern "ba-ba-ba-bee"</s>
goyim, haman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when two words precisely match in their sound or pronunciation, such as "home" and "boom" or "cat" and "mat." In the given words, there are slight differences in pronunciation, making them an approximate or slant rhyme. To make a perfect rhyme, the words' pronunciations should be identical, e.g., "boom" and "home."</s>
olokuei's, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme involves two words pronounced identically at the end of a line, with the same vowel sounds and potentially the same consonant sounds. In "olokuei's-germe," the '-s' sound is similar, but the words do not share the exact same vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
gaetano, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because the endings of the words are not the same and cannot create a natural cadence when spoken or sung. In order for words to rhyme, they must share the same final vowel sound or consonant. In this case, "gaetano" and "easel" do not share the same ending and therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
tsuda, schley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "tsuda-schley" can be considered a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the ending of two words sound exactly the same, regardless of the consonants or vowels before those endings. Both "tsuda" and "schley" end in the same way, so they fit the definition of a perfect rhyme.</s>
gotten, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gotten" and "osler" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
pucciarelli, passarelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "pucciarelli" and "passarelli" form a perfect rhyme since both words end with the same sound spelled differently ("-a-re-le-li" and "-as-a-re-li").</s>
mccary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mccary" and "mccrary" do form a perfect rhyme.

In the given phrase "mccary-mccrary," both the words share the same final syllables (ary) and have identical sets of letters, which is characteristic of perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when a pair of words has the same letters in their respective final syllables, thus emphasizing their matching musical quality and sound.</s>
schueler, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
cleary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "clearly-keary" form a perfect rhyme, as they both end with the same sounding syllables: "clearly" and "keary".</s>
rasner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schley, oelkers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
pseudoscience, noncompliance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schiller, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schiller" and "obryan" form a perfect rhyme in the iambic trimeter. Both words share the same ending sound (li:an), which can be considered a perfect rhyme since they follow the strict pattern of iambic meter (disyllabic iambs).</s>
encase, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "encase-oslo" do not form a perfect rhyme, as they do not have the same vowel sounds. A perfect rhyme involves words that rhyme in stressed syllables, whereas "encase" (stress on the first syllable) and "oslo" (stress on the second syllable) do not rhyme due to the difference in vowel sounds, specifically the consonant sounds in "en-" and "so-".</s>
sheley, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
diery, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "diery-thiery" forms a perfect diphthong rhyme. Both words have different consonant sounds and vowel sounds in the middle, but they end with the same vowel sound sequence /ER/ (dier-thie-ry), which results in a perfect rhyme.</s>
seader, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
zelia, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

The reason for this is that "zelia" and "primeaux" are spelled and pronounced differently, with distinct syllables and sounds. To have a perfect rhyme, the words should share the same melody, stress, and onset and rime sounds. "Zelia" and "primeaux" do not meet these criteria for a perfect rhyme.</s>
transformations, syndications, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

The words "transformations-syndications" do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not share identical end sounds, despite having similar word structures. A perfect rhyme would have identical end sounds, and while the ending "s" in both words sounds similar, the syllables and stressed sounds are different, resulting in an imperfect rhyme.</s>
haggart, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "haggart-kenney" forms a perfect rhyme because the end sounds ( -ag and -ney ) are identical in both words.</s>
o'shell, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words rhyme because the -shell and -geitner endings are in a matching pattern, resulting in a word-end rhyme.</s>
game, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same vowel sounds but do not have identical consonant patterns.</s>
costilla, cancilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "costilla" and "cancilla" rhyme, as they both consist of the same four-syllable pattern sound. However, the words are related to bones in Spanish, "costilla" meaning rib bone and "cancilla" meaning small rib. The difference exists in the type of bones and not in their rhyme.</s>
kian, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kian-arseneault" form a perfect rhyme since the final vowel sounds (the 'a' in both words) are pronounced identically and in the same position in each word.</s>
sader, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
fluorescence, evanescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "fluorescence" and "evanescence" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the "ence" sound, which makes them a rhyming pair. Perfect rhyme occurs when two words that rhyme with each other are pronounced identically, even though they may have differences in stress, syllables, or vowel quality. In this case, "fluorescence" and "evanescence" are pronounced the same and constitute a perfect rhyme.</s>
talty, faulty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, talty-faulty does form a perfect rhyme, as the -t of "talty" matches the -f of "faulty."</s>
locher, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "locher-germe" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the letter "e," and the vowel sounds at the end are also similar, creating a perfect rhyming scheme in the context of the given word pair.</s>
chery, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words chery and mccary do form a perfect rhyme, as they are words that sound the same when pronounced.</s>
zamarello, chiarello, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zamarello" and "chiarello" form a perfect rhyme, as both end with the same vowel sound and the same consonant sound.</s>
nix, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "nix-reasner" form a perfect or offsides rhyme because they share the same two-syllable rhyme word "-reas". However, the word "nix" does not rhyme with the rest of the word "reasner" because it does not share the same consonant/vowel scheme. It is considered a second level slant rhyme.</s>
caryl, deryle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.

The reason these words form a perfect rhyme is that the end sounds of the words ('lyle' sound) are exactly the same regardless of the initial sounds (the vowel sounds).</s>
reaver's, leaver's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "reaver's" and "leaver's" form a perfect rhyme as they have the same rhyming sounds at the end of the word (specifically, the /vr/ and /vr/ sounds).</s>
miscalculation, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, both the words contain the same consonant sound ending with the same vowel sound, making them a perfect rhyme. In English, the words that rhyme have vowels and consonants that sound the same, and it's called a perfect rhyme. In this example, words rhyme based on their endings, which is known as an internal rhyme. This pairing of words is common in poetry and helps to create a pleasing sound and meaningful expression. So, both "miscalculation" and "ideation" create a perfect rhyme with the letters 'e' and 'a'.</s>
necks, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "necks" and "kian" create a semiregular rhyme in English. They form a Semirhyme as they both end with the same sound (phonetic 'n'), but the second syllable is pronounced with a different vowel sound ('i' vs 'y').</s>
facilitation, annexation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the end sounds in the two words are exactly the same, like "sister" and "fister". However, "facilitation" and "annexation" share similar ending sounds but not the exact same - both words end with consonant sounds: "-ation" and "-xation". For a perfect rhyme in poetry and songs, the ending sound should be exactly the same.</s>
leaky, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes involve two words that end with exactly the same vowels and consonants. In this case, "leaky" and "elcotel" only share the same last three syllables, so they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
oleary, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oleary" and "biery" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound: /ai/, which is the final consonant sound in each word.</s>
shaul, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shaul" and "caen" form a perfect rhyme. They share identical vowel sounds, specifically "au" and "een" respectively.</s>
silveri, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "silveri" and "fery" do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not share the same vowel sound for the entire word, making the rhyme pattern incomplete. It is closer to a near rhyme or a "stressed vowel" rhyme due to the similarity between the ends of the words. It still technically has a rhyme, but it is not a perfect one as both words start with a different vowel sound (li) and do not end in the same vowel sound (i).</s>
mcgary, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "mcgary" and "very" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound, the vowel "ee" (spelled with an "ai" in "mcgary"). This is a common type of onomatopoeic or vowel-based rhyme, which often appears at the end of words.</s>
regimentation, calibration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "regimentation" and "calibration" form a perfect rhyme. They both have the ending "-tion," which is a common syllable that often creates perfect rhymes.</s>
bleary, mcgeary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "bleary-mcgeary" forms a perfect rhyme because both the words end in the same sounding syllable (ee-arrie-mcgearie).</s>
loco, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "loco-jammer" do form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes occur when the last sounds of two words are identical. In this case, both "loco" and "jammer" have the sound "oke" as their final syllables.</s>
circumspection, resurrection, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels and consonants of the two words are identical. In the words "circumspection-resurrection," the vowels "u" and "i" are not identical. A more accurate way to describe their relationship in a rhyme is that the words have an "approximate" or "slanted" rhyme. Approximate rhymes involve similar end sounds, but not the same exact vowel sounds.</s>
teary, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: In the English language, a perfect rhyme is when two words have the exact same sound when the stressed vowels and any following vowel sounds are removed. In the case of "teary-dreary," when the vowel sounds (/aɪ.əri/ and /di.ri/) are removed, the remaining sound is the same between the two words. This meets the criteria for a perfect rhyme.</s>
haggart, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'haggart' and 'enix' form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, they both end in the same sound, '-x', which makes them a perfect example of a rhyme.</s>
swilling, filling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. The "ing" in each word is pronounced identically and the word "swilling" shares the same ending sound with the word "filling" in the form of a perfect near rhyme.</s>
schley, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
cod, egerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cod-Egerton" form a perfect rhyme, as they are homophonous with each other.</s>
replication, rejuvenation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words sound exactly the same, with their vowel sounds and final consonants matching each other exactly. In the words "replication-rejuvenation," the vowel sounds do not match and the final consonants are different. Therefore, when spoken out loud, they do not sound exactly the same, making them a non-perfect rhyme.</s>
mccreary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mccreary-keary" form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same syllables and end with the same sound. They rhyme because they share the same last two syllables, "creary" and "keary," which both end in the sound 'a'.</s>
sawdey, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Sawdey and locker are at different ends of the rhyme scale, falling in different categories of consonance and resonance. Although they share a consonant sound at the end (the -ck sound), they differ in their vowel sounds (/ɔːsdaɪ/ vs /lɒkər/). A perfect rhyme, on the other hand, has the same vowel sound throughout.</s>
denials, dial's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not perfectly rhyme. They are partially related and partially non-related. "Denials" and "dial's" have a similar sound at the end, but they are not in the exact same pitch and do not follow the rules of traditional rhyme. They could make a partial rhyme, but they are not a perfect rhyme.</s>
creation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "creation-station" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
biery, mcqueary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme happens when two words sound the same and end with the same vowel sound, like "sun" and "fun." In "biery-mcqueary," the ending sounds similar (both being "-ery"), but the words are not identical. It's a near-rhyme, which means they almost sound the same, but not exactly.</s>
neary, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Nearly" and "dreary" have similar endings, but they do not have the exact same sound or consonantal pattern. Instead, they form a slant rhyme, where the sounds are similar, but not identical.</s>
nary, gery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "nary-gery" form a perfect rhyme. In the given words, "nary" and "gery" have the same ending sound - "ry" - that creates a perfect match for each other.</s>
self-congratulation, rehabilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme due to the differences in their onset tones (Initial consonants). You perceive consonant sounds first before vocalizing the vowel sounds in poetry.

"Self-congratulation" and "rehabilitation" have different initial consonants. In the first word, 'self' has a hard consonant sound, followed by the short 'e' vowel, and 'congratulation' sound. In the second phrase, 'rehabilitation' begins with the long 'e' and 'ai' vowel sound, followed by the final 't' consonant.

Therefore, although both words may have similar endings, the pronunciation and rhythm of "self-congratulation" and "rehabilitation" aren't identical, making it a non-perfect rhyme.</s>
lockers, patrol, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "lockers-patrol" do form a perfect rhyme.</s>
scholl, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "scholl-enix" forms a perfect rhyme. This is because the words have identical syllables and pronunciation at the ending, with the only difference being the initial sound of each word.</s>
scary, chery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
luecke, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, the words "luecke" and "jimmie" have a simple "y/e" sound change - 'y' becomes 'i' - but they do not perfectly match the pattern of rhyming words that typically ends with the "ee" or "oo" sound (e.g., "tree", "she", "sea").</s>
omary, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme as they have identical vowel sounds and consonants in a different position.</s>
torrence, florence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "torrence" and "florence" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending sound ("-ence").</s>
locher, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "locher" and "castings" form a perfect rhyme in the English language. A perfect rhyme has the same vowel sounds and stressed syllables in the beginning of the word. In this case, the endings -cher and -ngs are compatible with each other in terms of vowel sounds making them a perfect rhyme.</s>
altomare, degutare, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "altomare" and "degutare" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the last stressed syllables of two words sound exactly alike - for example: "sing" and "thing". In these words, the vowel sounds (the 'a' in altomare and the 'e' in degutare) are different, making them non-perfect rhymes. Therefore, it can be said that the words "altomare-degutare" form a near rhyme, as the vowel sound is similar for the unstressed syllables "lo" and "go" respectively but the stress lies on different syllables.</s>
summerlin, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme involves two words that have the exact same vowel and consonant sounds at the end of each word, while the other syllables may vary. In the case of "summerlin" and "elcotel," the beginning sounds are different, and the ending vowels are different, so they do not create a perfect rhyme.</s>
non-compliance, pseudoscience, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words, singly syllabled or not, have the same vowel sound at the close of the words. In this case, "non-compliance" and "pseudoscience" both end in "science", but "non-compliance" has an additional -non- and the first vowel (i.e., "o") is different, whereas in "pseudoscience" the first vowel is the same (i.e., "u"). Thus, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
shelly, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

In the provided words, "shelly" and "oslo," the letters 'l' and 'o' at the end form an "l-vowel" sound which creates a nasal sound pattern rather than a consonant-vowel pattern typical of a perfect rhyme. This makes the words imperfect rhymes.

A perfect rhyme is when two words sound the same. It involves a consonant-vowel pattern, and in simple terms, two words are said to rhyme perfectly if when you say one word, you hear the exact same pattern of sound in the other.</s>
tsuda, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'tsuda-ken' form a perfect rhyme, as they end with the same sound (-ken).</s>
calvillo, billow, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The reason is that they have slightly different stress patterns. In the word "calvillo," the first syllable has a strong stress, while the second syllable has a slightly weaker stress. The word "billow," on the other hand, has a strong stress on the first syllable, and a weaker stress on the second syllable. This creates a slight difference in syllable stress that prevents them from being a perfect rhyme.</s>
koehn, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
fluoridation, recalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "fluoridation" and "recalculation" do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes are those where the stressed vowels are the same at the end of both words: for example, "roast" and "frost". In this case, the stressed vowels in "fluoridation" and "recalculation" are completely different. Also, the syllables and sounds around the vowels are very different, i.e., "oor-id-a-shun" and "rek-a-cul-a-shun", leading to a less-than-optimal rhyming relationship.</s>
oelkers, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oelkers-kenney" do form a perfect rhyme, as they both end with the sound "ee" (pronounced as in "bee").</s>
scary, gery, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme involves words that end with exactly the same letters or sound, like "scary-gery", "silly-lily", or "shiny-diny". In the case of "scary-gery", the two words don't have the same ending and therefore lack the perfect rhyme necessary for an exact match.</s>
dairy, carey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "dairy" and "carey" do form a perfect rhyme because both words have the same vowel sounds at the end (ai) and share the same consonant pattern (dry-Car). They are a type of syllabic rhyme.</s>
innovation, devaluation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not have a perfect rhyme. The words "innovation" and "devaluation" have a similar sound but do not create a rhyme when stressed or unstressed, or stressed as one may expect from a proper rhyme scheme.</s>
shelor, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "shelor" and "kissling" do form a perfect rhyme as they share the same rhyme scheme or ending sound - "ling."</s>
consented, segmented, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "consented-segmented" form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same sounding letters - "n" and "d".</s>
teary, mccreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when each letter of a word is the same as a corresponding letter of another word. In the given words, "teary" and "mccreary," there are no identical letters in the same positions. This means that the words do not rhyme, so they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
pucciarelli, poparelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "pucciarelli" and "poparelli" form a perfect rhyme because they end with the same syllable sound, even though they have different spelling changes (u to i and o to a).</s>
sterilizations, gahm, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words at the end of a line or sentence sound exactly alike. In the words given, "sterilizations" and "gahm" only share a partial vowel sound ("ee" and "ahm"). To create a perfect rhyme, the words would need to have the exact same sound and end with the same letter or letters in that same order. For a list of words that would rhyme with "sterilizations," I would refer to known rhyming dictionaries or pattern databases.</s>
nonfinancial, circumstantial, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when a word has the exact same sound in both its stressed and unstressed syllables, as in "happy/kissy" or "trap/crap." 

However, "nonfinancial" is actually not a perfect rhyme with "circumstantial" due to differences in their stressed syllables: 

- "nonfinancial" rhymes more closely with "circumstantial" than with "financial", due to the stressed syllable being on "financial" in "nonfinancial".

"nonfinancial" is actually more of a blend rhyme with "circumstantial" because it does not have the exact same sound in both its stressed and unstressed syllables as a traditional rhyme like "happy/kissy".</s>
seder, scholl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The reason is that while "seder" and "scholl" have some similar vowel sounds, they are not identical in the way the letters are arranged and there is no shared ending sound between the two words. A perfect rhyme would have the same exact letters sound as each other and end in the same sound.</s>
mcleary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mcleary-beary" do form a perfect rhyme.</s>
herminie, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

In poetry, a perfect rhyme is when two words sound exactly the same, and have the same vowel sounds with a different vowel in the same position (known as a vowel match). In the words "herminie" and "germe," the vowel sound in the first word and the vowel in the second word are different, so the words do not rhyme perfectly; they more closely resemble a near rhyme.</s>
liberation, resignation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
quinoa, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No.

Justification: The given words "quinoa" and "jamb" do not form a perfect rhyme because a perfect rhyme would require the final consonant sounds to match exactly. In this case, the final consonant sounds in "quinoa" are "o" and in "jamb" are "mb".</s>
souder, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "souder" and "jimi" form a perfect rhyme. Both the first and last letters of the words are the same, creating a perfect ending rhyme. "Souder" is a variation of "sawder" or "soeder," and "jimi" is a shortened form of "Jimmo."</s>
mccary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mccary" and "mcnary" form a perfect rhyme, as they end with the same sound ("-ry").</s>
citation, authentication, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "citation-authentication" do not form a perfect rhyme, because they have slightly different sounds in the final syllables. A perfect rhyme has the same or very similar sounds in the two words' final syllables.</s>
koehn, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
schuler, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes.

These words form a perfect, or closed, rhyme because they share the same final sounds: "ler" in "schuler" and "ton" in "guyton." A perfect rhyme occurs when the stressed vowels and their endings sound exactly the same in both words.</s>
oecd, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The words "oecd-geitner" do not follow the same pattern for vowels and consonants as a perfect rhyme does. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the exact same sequence of vowels and consonants, such as "mother" and "thor" or "girl" and "hill." In "oecd-geitner," the "o" and "e" in the second word are different, so they cannot be considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
consummation, miscalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

Both words do form a perfect rhyme because they share the syllable "m-s-c," as each ends with a consonant sound. These words have the same root and have similar spelling and pronunciation, which means they are considered to be a perfect rhyme in English.</s>
decapitations, syndications, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not perfectly rhyme. The reason is that "decapitations" rhymes with "decapitations" and "syndications" rhymes with "decapitations". But when you put these two phrases together, they do not form a cohesive or natural-sounding phrase, resulting in a less than perfect rhyme.</s>
mary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
szalay, gemmer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "szalay-gemmer" do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when the ending sounds of two words are exactly the same. In this case, "szalay" and "gemmer" both end with the syllable -ay,-er, but the 'a' in the first word is silent and the vowels of the two words are different, so it cannot be considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
seader, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sader" and "Gaetano" do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes involve pronounciations that are identical or nearly identical, wherein the final sounds of the words match exactly. However, "sader" and "Gaetano" differ not only in pronunciation, but also in spelling and likely in meaning.</s>
swilling, billing, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the terms "swilling-billing" do not form a perfect rhyme. In this case, the words don't rhyme with each other because they share the same vowels and consonants (s, w, l, i and g, b, l), but they don't create the same rhythmic pattern or sound. A perfect rhyme would have two words that have the same rhyme scheme. Here, swilling and billing seem to attempt to rhyme with each other but they don't create the same sound rhythm. Swilling is more akin to 'swirl' or 'wail', while billing resembles 'bling' or 'wring'. They are trying to find the right notes to harmonize, but they seem to not have found the right melody, so they don't form a perfect rhyme. 

For a perfect rhyme of these words, we could look into words rhyming with 'billing':
- winding
- ringing
- tiling
- tiling

In these words, both the vowel sounds and the consonants are different but create the same vibration as 'billing'. On the other hand, words like, 'swimming' or 'flimflam' may not share all the same sounds and are not considered rhymes. But 'swilling' and 'billing' are trying to rhyme, and based on its current structure, it doesn't form a perfect rhyme.</s>
admiration, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
cedar, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes.

The words "cedar" and "kenney" form a perfect rhyme because they share the same last three letters in their word formation, specifically "er" for "cedar" and "ney" for "kenney."</s>
magnification, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because "magnification" and "panelization" do not share the same vowel sound and a rhyming pattern is established only in words like "stanza", "ban", "pan", "man", "man", "span", "tan", "can" etc. where the last or succeeding vowel sounds is same in both words. These two words do not meet that criterion.</s>
geary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: In rhyme, words are "identified" as rhyming if their last sounds are identical. In the words "geary" and "beary", the last sounds "ey" and "rey" respectively, have the same vowel (i.e., ['e']) and a similar consonant pattern (both words end with "y"). Therefore, these two words are considered to be rhymes. 

Perfect rhyme refers to a form of rhyme where the last sounds have the same vowel (e.g., "geary" and "beary") and a nearly identical consonant pattern, typically involving similar fricative or affricative sounds. Both "geary" and "beary" satisfy this perfect rhyme definition since you can discern only a slight difference in the consonant sound (the 'r' is slightly different) which isn't enough to qualify it as a perfect rhyme, but it comes very close to a perfect rhyme based on the definitions given.</s>
o'shell, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "o'shell-iacona" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when two words sound exactly alike, often using the same consonants and vowels. In this case, "o'shell-iacona" uses a slant rhyme, in which one vowel or consonant is slightly different, giving the words a similar sound but not a perfect match.</s>
bessent, fluorescent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bessent-fluorescent" form a perfect rhyme. Both words share the same vowel sounds (b, e, s, n, t, l, and fl) at the end, creating a perfect rhyme.</s>
interpretation, calibration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words, "interpretation-calibration", do form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same syllable structure and the same sounding final consonant. In this case, both words end with "-tation," and the second word, "calibration," is a perfect rhyme.</s>
easel, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

The reason is that "easel" and "oconnor" are not in the same part of speech, and therefore don't form a traditional rhyme. "Easel" is a noun used for an artist's table or a stand for display, while "oconnor" is a surname or last name. These two words have different meanings and don't naturally fit together in a rhyme. In other words, they don't sound similar enough to count as a rhyme.</s>
bleary, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. To form a perfect rhyme, the ending words must be identical in sound, syllable count, and meaning. In this case, "bleary-biery" has two syllables, "bleary," which has a soft 'r' sound, and "biery," which ends with the 'r' sound as well, but they do not have the same stress or meaning.</s>
russification, simulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "russification" and "simulation" form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the exact same vowel sounds in their root words, either in the same syllable or at the end of each word. In this case, both words have the same vowel sounds "russ" and "simu," which create a perfect rhyme.</s>
scholey, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, both words "scholey" and "zel" form a perfect rhyme as they have the same vowel pattern (sch, le, ze) and the same last consonants (ly, y).</s>
gumm, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "gumm-obryan" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when two words have the same vowel sounds at the end of the word, regardless of the previous consonant sounds, so it would sound like a match or sound equally good when you repeat the words but backwards. Here, the original words, "gummo-bryan," have the same ending vowel 'o', and that makes a perfect rhyme, but the words "gumm" and "bryan" are different syllables, so it does not sound right to rhyme both words altogether.</s>
haman, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "haman-zeal" forms a perfect rhyme because they both end with the same syllable sound and stress pattern: "aman" and "zeal."</s>
contusion, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not rhyme perfectly. 

The reason is that "contusion" rhymes with its own spelling while "reisenauer" rhymes with an unrelated word, "eisenauer," which is a different name that also has a similar ending. The two words do not rhyme with each other, just with their own spellings.</s>
keen, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "keen-jamb" form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes share the same vowel sounds and end with the same consonant sounds, in this case, "keen" and "jamb."</s>
knicks', conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because "knicks'" is a common misspelling or abbreviation of "nick," and when combined with "conn," the result is not a clear and recognizable word. The correct spelling and rhyming word would be "knacks" or "links."</s>
loci, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the words rhyme exactly in terms of vowel sounds and consonant sounds. The word "loci" and "gemme" only partially rhyme – the "o" sound in "loci" rhymes with the "e" sound in "gemme," but the "e" sound in "gemme" does not exactly match the "i" sound in "loci."</s>
gotten, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gotten" and "roesner" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in the same vowel sound (rhyming "got" and "net") and the same consonant sound (rhyming "ten" and "enre").</s>
roesner, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the given words "roesner-barrineau" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels and consonants of one word perfectly match with another word's vowels and consonants. In this case, the words "roesner" and "barrineau" have no common vowels or consonants that can form a perfect match, and that results in no rhyme between the two words. A possible close rhyme could be "barrineau" with another word like "barbera" or "barre."</s>
connor, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "connor" and "jamb" form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the letters "or" and "mb," respectively. They are an instance of a slant rhyme and a full anapestic trochee.</s>
ozelle, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme.

Both words, "ozelle" and "borneo," share a common ending sound -oo, resulting in a perfect, onset-medial-onset (OMO) rhyme. Wordplay and rhyming are important techniques to draw attention, express emotion, and entertain readers or listeners. In this case, the words create a playful and fun effect when used together, as they share not only the last syllable but also part of the middle sound, further emphasizing their similar ending sounds.</s>
kuehner, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "kuehner" and "orson" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: A perfect rhyme is a term in poetry that refers to when two words have the same vowel sound at the end of each word. In this case, "kuehner" and "orson" are similar in spelling and sound, but they do not have the exact same vowel sound at the end of each word. Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
circumventing, tenting, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

The reason behind this classification is that the vowel sounds within these words are different. In "circumventing," the long "o" sound at the end of the syllable "venting" establishes the long, open vowel, whereas in "tenting," the vowel "e" sounds close to a "y" sound, which results in a different vowel in each syllable. The consonant sounds, however, share the same set of letters and would generally be considered a matching rhyme in many poetry and song writing contexts.</s>
priam, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

Although both words, "priam" and "locatelli," have similar sounding consonant clusters at the end ("am" and "llo"), they do not form a perfect rhyme because the pattern between the vowel sounds is different. In the case of "priam," the "I" sound is followed by a more open "A" sound, while in "locatelli," the "ll" ending creates a more closed "E" sound. Thus, although the consonant sounds rhyme, the pattern of the vowel sounds does not fully match.</s>
oslo, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oslo" and "bahraini" form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same vowel sound (/-LI/).</s>
non-residential, essential, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

The words chosen, "non-residential-essential," have a weak rhyme between the first syllables "non-residential" and "essential." A perfect rhyme would have identical or near-identical sounds for both words from each syllable until the end. However, the second part of each word has different sounds, making them a weak rhyme.</s>
dorrance, st_lawrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
o'shell, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the provided words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: The words "o'shell" and "geremia" have an abrupt or inconsistent sound similarity in their endings. If the two words were written differently or if syllables were given emphasis, they more closely resemble a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme has words that have a clear pattern or sound in their endings, such as "bird" and "friend" or "love" and "toe." In the case of "o'shell" and "geremia," there is not a clear and consistent pattern to their endings, so they do not qualify as a perfect rhyme.</s>
health, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "health" and "zulli" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme requires two words that sound exactly the same when saying one word cuts the other short, such as "kitty" and "pity" or "trout" and "couth". However, "health" and "zulli" have similar endings, but the vowel sounds are not identical, therefore they don't create a perfect rhyme.</s>
indoctrination, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in the same sound but have different letters, creating a seamless rhyming sound.</s>
kantle, chantal, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme is when two words sound exactly the same when the stress and accent patterns are ignored. In the words "kantle" and "chantal," the words sound somewhat similar, but with slight differences in the stressed syllables, and the pronunciation of the "c" in "chantal" changes. Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
kanne, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
stiller's, drillers, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "stiller's-drillers" do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes occur when the last vowel sound (consonant sound) match in both words, like the way 'dog' and 'god' rhyme. However, the last syllable '-drillers' does share some similar vowel sounds at the end. Nonetheless, this is just a close or "near" perfect rhyme, and not a perfect rhyme.</s>
cleary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "cleary" and "beary" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the vowels of the two words have the same length and produce the same final sound. In this case, "cleary" and "beary" do not have the same final sound, so they fall short in being a perfect rhyme.</s>
non-residential, preferential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "non-residential-preferential" do form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound "-ential."</s>
guertin, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "guertin-smullen" form a perfect rhyme. 

To determine if two words form a perfect rhyme, we look for vowels and consonants that correspond in the same position and sound. In this case, the "T" and "L" at the end of both words create a match, regardless of the other phonetic nuances. Thus, guertin and smullen have the same last letter, which results in a perfect rhyme.</s>
shelley, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shelley" and "koehn" form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound ("-y" and "-n").</s>
cheery, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cheery" and "thiery" form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the sound /r/. In this case, the two words have the same syllable structure (/sAirI/), while the penultimate consonants differ (/j/ and /r/). This meets the criteria for a perfect rhyme.</s>
reevaluation, exclamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme since "re-evaluation" and "exclamation" do not have identical vowel sounds in all their syllables, which is a key aspect of perfect rhyme.</s>
zele, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words "zelle-jammer" form a perfect rhyme. They both have the same vowel and consonant sounds at the end, creating a perfect match in rhyming structure.</s>
predestination, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "predestination" and "ideation" form a perfect rhyme in the sense that both words end with the same sound (pronounced as /ɪdiˈeɪʃən/).</s>
achene, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme happens when two words that end with the same consonant sound are used. In this case, "achene" and "jammer" both end in the same consonant sound (the "A" sound), but they are two separate words with different meanings, and the word "achene" is not a valid variation of "jammer." A valid rhyme would be to replace "jammer" with "thinner" which rhymes with "achene" because it ends with the same consonant sound (the "A" and "N" sounds).</s>
conn, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "conn-brun" form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same sound at the end of the word.</s>
saudi, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "saudi-sterilizations" form a perfect rhyme. This is because the vowel sounds (/æ/) and (/a:/), which are in the syllables "saudi" and "stereilizations," respectively, are identical. As a result, the words can rhyme with one another, which makes them form a perfect rhyme.</s>
kin, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because they end with the same sound, specifically the /l/-sound. The words are "kin" and "locatelli."</s>
jheryl, sheryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "jheryl-sheryl" form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same sound (er).</s>
seider, chalet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "seider-chalet" form a perfect rhyme in German. The German language's phonetic features make "seider" and "chalet" match perfectly in the last two syllables to enable the formation of a beautiful and satisfying rhyme.</s>
bleary, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bleary-thiery" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
petrelli, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme since there is a vowel followed by the same vowel sound in both words (a).</s>
stimulation, dissemination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, stimulation and dissemination do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same two syllables, "m-a-ti-c-i-a-n" and "emin-i-a-n," which create a smooth, harmonious sound. Perfect rhyme is typically characterized by two words having identical phonemes in their endings.</s>
dancers', cancers, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these two words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Dancers' cancers" consists of two words separated by a hyphen, and "cancers" is the plural form of "cancer," indicating several instances of the same condition. While both words share a common prefix (dancers- and cancers-), the meanings differ, and it is not easy to find a smooth sonantic connection between them. However, if the hyphen in "dancers'-cancers" is removed, "dancers cancers" could potentially form a rhyme with "dancers' cancers."</s>
synchronization, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "synchronization-graduation" forms a perfect rhyme.

To determine if a word pair forms a perfect rhyme, we look at their last sounds, which are /si(n)-kro(o)na-see-sh(u)n-a-sh(u)n/ and /ɡrə(u)-ju(u)-n(u)-sh(u)n/ respectively. These sounds are exact repetitions (apart from the /-u-/), showing a perfect rhyme.</s>
zulli, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "zulli-summerlin" forms a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same syllable sound and are homophones, which means they sound the same but have different meanings.</s>
replication, stagflation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because the consonant sounds "l" in "replication" and "t" in "stagflation" are not identical. In a perfect rhyme, the last sounds of the two words would be exactly the same in terms of phonetics. However, the "t" sound in "stagflation" is not exactly the same as the "l" sound in "replication", so they don't form a perfect rhyme.</s>
breon, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "breon-germer" form a perfect rhyme because they have the same sound when pronounced. The syllables "reon" and "mer" sound exactly alike, and there are no other letters in the words that change the pronunciation, making them a perfect rhyme.</s>
heeling, teeling, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes are exact matches of vowel sounds followed by identical consonant sounds at the ends of words. In the given words, "heeling" and "teeling" both end with the same consonant sound ("-ing" and "-eling"), but the vowel sounds are different (a different vowel sound is used for "eeling" compared to "eling"). Therefore, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
vary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound, /ɛrɪ/. The words "vary" and "McCrary" both end with the /ɛrɪ/ sound, creating a perfect match in terms of rhyme.</s>
ashley, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ashley-arseneau" do form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same syllable and sound, making "ashley" and "arseneau" perfect rhyming words.</s>
gomer, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gomer" and "brion" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
gotten, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when the words shared the exact same sound (phonetically) throughout the vowel sounds as well as at the end of the respective words. In this case, "gotten" and "brony" sound similar, but not exactly the same, as "gotten" is a past participle form of "get" and "brony" is a fictional horse character in the My Little Pony franchise.</s>
connor, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
argumentation, cremation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
schuller, gummi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the two words "schuller" and "gummi" form a perfect rhyme because they have the same syllables and end sounding the same.</s>
goyim, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because both end in the same sound, specifically the consonant "t" sound. The difference in the vowels before the consonant doesn't affect the rhyming aspect of the words.</s>
egerton, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes.

These words, "Egerton-Arseneault", form a perfect rhyme because, when you break down the words into individual syllables, they have the same rhyming pattern: 

"Egerton" has four syllables: Eh-geh-ter-uh
"Arseneault" has six syllables: Ahr-zeh-nay-oul

By comparing the syllable structure, we can see that the two words have a pattern of "Eh-geh-ter-uh" and "Ahr-zeh-nay-oul", resulting in a perfect rhyme.</s>
zarroli, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "zarroli" and "ireson" form a perfect rhyme because they have the same vowel and consonant sounds. The only difference between the two words is the syllable pattern, but they still sound the same when pronounced.</s>
carnation, gasification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme as they both end in the same sound - 'f'-ation.</s>
gomer, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gomer" and "orson" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
oslo, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oslo-rasner" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending sound (longer 'a' sound). A perfect rhyme is when two words have exactly the same last sound or syllable.</s>
schley, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "schley" and "germe" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same end sound (/ʁi.me̞/).</s>
mccleery, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme as they have the same ending sounds, specifically -ery and -reary. The letters in the middle of the words are not identical, but they sound the same, which is what determines a rhyming word pair in English.</s>
acid, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Although "acid" and "encase" have similar sounds, they do not rhyme in the traditional sense. In a perfect rhyme, the stressed syllables would be the same, while "acid" and "encase" have different stressed syllables. Additionally, the meaning of the words is different. "Acid" refers to a chemical substance, while "encase" refers to enclose something completely.</s>
glances, refinances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "glances" and "refinances" do have a perfect rhyme, which is a type of rhyme called a "sesquipedalian rhyme" or "sesquiphone rhyme." In this type of rhyme, one or more words have the exact same pronunciation as the rhyming word even though they may have different spelling and potentially different meanings.</s>
sighed, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Sighed" and "excelling" are an internal rhyme, which means that they share a single syllable sound (sigh-ing), but they do not have identical vowel and consonant sounds. A perfect rhyme would have identical vowel and consonant sounds in both words.</s>
arseneau, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Rhyming words have the same vowel sounds at the end. In "arseneau-brion", the -uan sound in 'arseneau' and the -ion sound in 'brion' are different. This causes the words to not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
predestination, calculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. They share the vowel sounds "ed" and "a."</s>
francesmary, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "francesmary" and "mccary" form a perfect rhyme because they both end in "ary" and have the same vowel sounds.</s>
aspiration, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these two words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

The word "aspiration" rhymes with either "vision," "vision," or "mission" depending on the context and accent. However, it does not rhyme with "meditation."

Similar logic applies to "meditation." Although it almost rhymes with "spiration" (a word form of "aspiration"), it does not rhyme with "meditation." A rhyming pair of words would sound exactly the same if they were read out loud.</s>
annexation, creation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "annexation" and "creation" form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: Perfect rhymes are words that have the same ending sound, such as "sing" and "thing" or "dog" and "god". In this case, "annexation" and "creation" both end with the sound -t-n, which is present in both words, making it a perfect rhyme.</s>
vary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
torrence, abhorrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the same vowel sound and identical consonant sounds at the end. In this case, "torrence" and "abhorrence" both have the same vowel sound [ɔr] and identical consonant sounds [ns].</s>
sidey, szalay, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

Justification: Both words, "sidey-szalay", although not commonly found in everyday speech and not a word in the known English language, showcase a close-to-perfect rhyming pattern. By analyzing their individual phonetic sounds, one can easily discern a near-perfect match between the /a/ sounds at the ends of the two words. Although unfamiliar, this does indicate a pattern, making it technically a rhyme.</s>
canary, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "canary" and "fery" form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound.</s>
elko, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "elko" and "smolen" form a perfect rhyme because they have the same sound at the end of each word: "el-ko" for "elko" and "smol-en" for "smolen".</s>
gettin', jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "gettin'-jaimie" forms a perfect rhyme.</s>
interpretation, miscalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when two words have the same ending sound, usually with a rhyme scheme such as AABB or ABAB, where two groups share the same ending word but in a different syllable. In the given phrases, interpretation and miscalculation, the words end with different consonant sounds but share the same vowel sound. This is an example of an imperfect rhyme instead of a perfect one.</s>
kaner, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because "rossin" does not have the same vowel pattern as "kaner." Although both words end with the same consonant sound (/s/ in "rossin" and "kaner"), the different vowel sound at the beginning of each word makes them non-perfect rhymes.</s>
subordination, cremation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the end sounds of the two words are identical and pronounced the same. In this case, "subordination" and "cremation" sound similar but have distinct and distinctive ending sounds, making their rhyming quality poor.</s>
canney, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme requires the ending sounds to be identical and not just similar or different in pronunciation but also in meaning. "Canney" and "baran" are not exactly the same, as "canney" is a Celtic term for a person or thing related to or associated with the Devil, while "baran" is a Sanskrit word meaning "a large banner." So, even though one means like the other and the sounds might be similar, they still don't rhyme perfectly.</s>
kanne, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme because both terms end with the same sounding letters: -ne/re (pronounced as "ne" and "are"). This forms a proper rhyming couplet.</s>
siminski, rucinski, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "siminski" and "rucinski" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
russification, pronunciation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "russification" and "pronunciation" are often considered partial rhymes that can be used within a sentence because they are homophones (words that sound alike but have different meanings), although their exact rhymes may vary depending on the context. The "-ication" suffix in "russification" and the "-ance" suffix in "pronunciation" are the main sources of their partial rhyme.</s>
kin, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

"Kin-bran" is a blended word formed from two separate words, "kin" (meaning family) and "-bran" (related to something or someone from the same family or origin). To form a perfect rhyme, the words must have the same vowel sound and/or consonant sound at the end of the syllables. Therefore, "kin-bran" does not have the same exact ending sounds to create a perfect rhyme.</s>
necks, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The sound of "zele" does not match the rhythm or melody of "necks" when both words are sung or spoken together.</s>
sighed, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, "sighed" and "berna" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the stressed vowels in the two words are identical, resulting in two words that sound exactly the same. In this case, "sighed" and "berna" have different vowel sounds and do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
gahm, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: In poetry, perfect rhyme refers to identical sounds at the ends of words. Comparing "gahm-hermann" we notice that "ahm" almost forms a rhyme but they do not sound completely the same due to the difference in sound of the 'g' in "gahm". Therefore, it should not be classified as perfect rhyme.</s>
severino, tomatino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "severino" and "tomatino" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
seader, homann, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The sounds at the end of the two words do not perfectly match. "Seader" rhymes with "maker" and "homann" has a slightly different ending consonant sound, making it not a perfect match for the first syllable.</s>
predation, balkanization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "predation-balkanization" form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification:

The two words share the same last syllable "-znation." In the word "predation," the consonant "t" creates a rhyming ending with the similar pattern in "balkanization," which is why they form a perfect rhyme.</s>
gencarelli, bucciarelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gencarelli" and "bucciarelli" do form a perfect rhyme, as they end with the same consonant sound - /ˈdʒɛniːkərəli/ and /bʌkiˈɛrli/. Rhyming is a technique used in poetry and songwriting to create musicality and emphasize the relationship between two words or sounds. In this case, the two words exhibit a "b" or "v" sound followed by an "i" and "e" sound, which is a common pattern for ending words in Italian and similar languages.</s>
mccary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words McCary and contrary do form a perfect rhyme, as both end with the syllable /rəri/.</s>
coinsurance, occurrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have similar or identical sounds at the end of their corresponding syllables, with the same vowel or consonant sounds at the end. In this case, "coinsurance" and "occurrence" both end in the same vowel sound ("u"), resulting in a perfect rhyme.</s>
notification, exclamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "notification" and "exclamation" do form a perfect rhyme. 

To determine this, we compare the vowels and consonants in both words:

1. "Notification" has the syllables NOTE-fication.
 - "NOTE" (long-o)
 - "fication" (k-SHUNG)

2. "Exclamation" has the syllables EX-kla-shun.
 - "EX-" (k)
 - "cla-shun" (long-o-SHUN)

Comparing the long 'o' sounds in "NOTE" and "long-o-SHUN", with the 'k' sound before "cla," we can see that the stress and pronunciation align perfectly to form a perfect rhyme. So, "notification" and "exclamation" are a perfect rhyme in the English language.</s>
refrigeration, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

"Refrigeration" and "nitration" are not a perfect match for each other, as they have different meanings and sounds when pronounced, making it difficult for them to create a smooth and matching rhyme. A perfect rhyme would have the same vowel sounds and similar syllables, which is not the case here.</s>
stary, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words "stary-mccary" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the end sounds of two words are exactly the same (e.g., "time and dime"). In this case, the word "stary" and "mccary" have different vowel sounds and are not perfectly rhymed.</s>
hyman, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "hyman" and "jaimie" can be considered as a perfect rhyme because they both end with the same sounds, and there are no intervening vowels or consonants to change the underlying rhyme. Rhyming is a fundamental component of poetry and music, and perfect rhymes, such as in this case, often evoke a strong emotional response from listeners.</s>
refinances, enhances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme, as both end in the sound 'ans', which is a typical pattern in many forms of poetry and songwriting.</s>
zedillo's, amarillos, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not rhyme perfectly. 

Zedillo's and amarillos both have the "ll" sound at the end, which can sound similar in some contexts, but they have different vowel sounds in the middle of the words. Therefore, they don't have a perfect rhyme.</s>
koehne, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "koehne-rosene" form a perfect rhyme, as they both end with the same sound. A perfect rhyme involves two words that sound exactly the same at the end.</s>
guidance, subsidence, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, the word "subsidence" is a noun and does not lend itself to being harmonized with the rhyme scheme of "guidance". The letters in the words have different pronunciations, making a perfect rhyme impossible. Perfect rhymes occur when the last consonants (or vowels if words end in /ə/ or /ɪ/) in the two words are exactly the same. Thus, "guidance" would need to end with the same consonants or vowels as "subsidence" for a perfect rhyme.</s>
rosten, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
kearny, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kearny" and "oren" form a perfect rhyme, as both end in the sound /ərən/.</s>
recreation, dictation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because "recreation" and "dictation" do not have matching vowel sounds or letter patterns. In this case, the i and e sounds in "recreation" don't sound the same as the i and a in "dictation," making the words a non-perfect rhyme.</s>
antone, mantione, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "antone" and "mantione" form a perfect rhyme. 

Let me explain:

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words sound exactly the same in terms of their vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end of the words. This type of rhyme is the most common and pleasing to the ear. So, in the phrase "antone-mantione", both words share the same consonant sounds ('t' and 'n' in both words) and vowel sounds ('o' sound before the 'n' in both words). Therefore, it forms a perfect rhyme.</s>
administrations, rehabilitations, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as they do not share a vowel sound at the end of each word. Although there is a slight similarity in the sounds they create, they do not meet the criteria for a perfect rhyme, which requires the same underlying vowel sound within the last syllable of each word.</s>
biery, diery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. 

In poetry and music, a perfect rhyme occurs when two words sound exactly the same while pronounced, and this is often achieved by using identical spelling. In the words "biery-diery," both words end with the same syllable, '-ri-,' making them perfect rhymes.

When one thinks of a perfect rhyme, they are thinking of two words that sound exactly alike and make a satisfying musical end to a line of a song or poem. This is because the rhymes create a musical effect, with a satisfying cadence when spoken or sung. It can also create emphasis on a particular word or phrase.

Let's break down these words to see how they sound alike: 

biery - rhymes with biery (sounds identical)
diery - rhymes with biery (sounds identical)
 
This is considered a perfect, or ideal rhyme, because the spelling and pronunciation match perfectly.</s>
keeney, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "keeney" and "baran" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound - [ən], making them perfect rhymes. In music, this kind of rhyme is called a "blend" or "semi-vowel" rhyme.</s>
daryl, caryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "daryl" and "caryl" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in the similar long vowel sound '-ly' and have the same syllable structure.</s>
hohman, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hohman" and "bruner" form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound (/nuər/ in both cases).</s>
sader, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

The justification for my answer is that the words "sader" and "arseneault" do not have the same number of vowels or syllables, making them a type of "near rhyme" rather than a true perfect rhyme.

In poetry and songwriting, the rhyme scheme is an essential aspect of the structure and artistic representation. A perfect rhyme involves two words that sound identical when they are spoken aloud. These words, "sader" and "arseneault," do not have this property, making them unsuitable for a true perfect rhyme in a musical context or a written poem.</s>
kaney, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kaney" and "smolen" form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same syllable sound (/ˈkeɪni/) and share the same consonant and vowel sounds throughout the word.</s>
installation, fluoridation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the sounds in the last syllables of two words are exactly the same, such as "star" and "bar". In this case, while "installation" and "fluoridation" are both words related to water treatment, the last syllables have different sounds and don't form a perfect rhyme.</s>
observation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because the syllable structure and ending sounds do not align exactly. The first word has a short "i" sound followed by a word ending in "z", while the second word has a short "a" sound followed by a word ending in "tn". Perfect rhyme requires words to have identical syllables and endings in order to create a strong musical effect.</s>
weary, leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes.

These words form a perfect rhyme because both ends of the words end in the same sound or same letters. In this case, "eary" and "leary" make up the rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the ending sounds or letters are the same.</s>
cona, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words, "cona-brawny," do form a perfect rhyme. The last two syllables, "-na" and "-rawny," sound alike, which is necessary for a perfect rhyme. The "n" sound in both syllables is pronounced similarly, and the "a" sound is also similar.</s>
enix, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "enix-jammer" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same end sound (the sound of the "x" in "jam").</s>
billy's, fillies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sterilizations, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do NOT form a perfect rhyme because they do not share the same ending sounds. 

"sterilizations" has the rhyme scheme "s-a-t" while "jimmie" has the rhyme scheme "j-i-e". Despite both being spelt similarly, the different endings of the two words create different sounds and therefore do not form a perfect rhyme when strung together.</s>
thiery, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "thiery-dreary" forms a perfect rhyme. It has the same rhyme scheme in the end. However, it's important to understand that word play in English, like the rhyme form, is more complex than simply checking for identical last sounds of words, it's more of a cultural norm and contextual expression. So, it doesn't work consistently or uniformly across all cases. For instance, while "kettle-pot" is a rhyme, "better-cetera" is not. Therefore, understanding the context is crucial to ascertain the correctness of the answer and not just relying on simple letter comparisons.</s>
shirlee, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shirlee-jam" form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme is characterized by two words that share identical or nearly identical vowel sounds and similar short-vowel consonant sounds at the end of the syllables. In this case, "shirlee" and "jam" both end with identical vowel sounds (o) followed by nearly identical consonant sounds (r-l-i-e).</s>
cheryl, beryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "cheryl" and "beryl" form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same sound, /rɪl/ (where "il" is pronounced like "el").</s>
nix, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "nix-zarroli" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme requires that two words have the same vowel sound at the end, while still having different consonant sounds. In this case, the words can still be considered partially rhyming because they share the consonant sounds, and therefore, they can be described as "partially rhymed."</s>
sowed, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme, as they both end with the same sound "-emmie".</s>
chery, mcgary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "chery" and "mcgary" do form a perfect rhyme. In this case, "chery" is a shortened version of "cherry," and "mcgary" is a surname. The spelling similarity creates a perfect rhyme.</s>
essential, preferential, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

The reason is that the words "essential" and "preferential" do not have a common vowel sound in the root of the word, which is necessary for a perfect rhyme. 

In the words "essential" and "preferential", "essent" and "pref" are the root sounds, and the vowel sounds are different, which makes a perfect rhyme impossible. 

For a word to rhyme perfectly with another word, the same vowel sound, or vowel combination, must appear at the end of each word, even if it is lengthened in the second word.</s>
saudi, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "saudi" and "ken" rhyme in the given context, as they share the ending vowel sound and identical consonant patterns.</s>
kilimanjaro, cafaro, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as the stressed syllables are not identical. 

In the given words, "kilimanjaro" and "cafaro" have different final sounds or vowels ('jo' in 'kilimanjaro,' 'f' in 'cafaro'). A perfect rhyme requires identical endings or vowels. For a perfect rhyme, these words would need to be changed to either "kilimanjaro-kafaro" or "katimanjaro-cafaro".</s>
interrante, morganti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "interrante" and "morganti" form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have identical vowel sounds and identical or near-identical consonant sounds at the end of a word, in this case at the end of the words "interrante" and "morganti."</s>
lachney, hackney, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because they have the exact same spelling, with only the vowels and consonants in a different order. They both start with the same combination of letters: "L-A-C-H-N-E-Y". This is why they are considered a perfect rhyme in the context of poetry and language.</s>
luckie, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme (also known as a near rhyme, or a slant rhyme) because the ending sounds (the syllables /juːmər/) are the same and sound similar, with some variations in pronunciation.</s>
luck, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "luck-jimmie" do form a perfect rhyme. They share the same ending sound "-im-" which creates a perfect rhyme.</s>
souder, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "souder" and "gotten" do not form a perfect rhyme.

In the provided phrase "souder-gotten," the words souder and gotten do not have the same last syllable or onset, which are crucial characteristics in the formation of a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the onset and the last syllable exactly match. The onset refers to the initial part of the word, which is the root or first syllable, and the last syllable refers to the ending part of the word, which often consists of a vowel sound followed by consonant sounds.

Analyzing these two words:

1. In "souder," the onset is "soud" and the last syllable is "der," which is the sound of the word "bed."
2. In "gotten," the onset is "got" and the last syllable is "ten," which is the sound of the word "caught."

Although "der" and "ten" have a similar vowel sound and final consonant ("t" in "ten"), they do not have the same onset, making the words in this phrase not a perfect rhyme.</s>
aside, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "aside" and "kearn" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with a consonant sound (specifically the same consonant "k"), making them a perfect "Vowel-Syllable-Consonant" rhyme.</s>
kaney, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kaney" and "summerlin" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same rhyme scheme: "ane" and "line."</s>
acid, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: "acid" and "priam" do not perfectly rhyme, as the sound changes between the two words. A perfect rhyme consists of words that share the exact same sound, phonetically. In this case, the sounds "a" and "i" in "acid" and "priam" make the words imperfect rhymes.</s>
armadillo, pucillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words can be an archaic or made-up word form. However, if you would simply see the letters, there's a similar ending sound for armadillo and pucillo (a diminutive form of puccia, probably referring to a small female mouse). Therefore, they form a homophonous pair of syllables which rhyme. Even if we don't have information about the origins of these words, the letters suggest a rhyming relationship.</s>
sudd, scholl, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Although they have a similar sound, "sudd" in "sudd-scholl" should actually be "tut-scol" or "bott-scol" for there to be a proper rhyme.</s>
subordination, computerization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhyme involves words that share identical vowel sounds at the end, and alliteration, assonance, and other poetic devices are utilized to achieve rhyme. In these words, the vowels, except for 'y' and 'u,' are not identical, and additional sounds separate the words in a way that prevents a perfect rhyme.</s>
ireson, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as they do not rhyme with each other. 

'Ireson' and 'jemmie' have no clear letter or sound pattern that would help them appear rhyming. This could be the case because they are unrelated words or misspelled. In general, words that rhyme typically have a common base sound (such as 'cat' and 'hat' or 'sky' and 'cry').</s>
cane, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cane" and "bruney" form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, the reason for their rhyme is that both words end in the same sounding consonant syllable (C/N/E/E), which creates a perfect rhyme.</s>
cahn, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same vowel sound spelled differently: 'cahn' vs 'brawny.' The 'n' in 'cahn' and the 'y' in 'brawny' create a perfect rhyme in the words.</s>
darjeeling, appealing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme. Both words have the same ending sound, "aling," which creates a perfect match for the pattern of rhyme in the phrase "darjeeling-appealing."</s>
predestination, facilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because they end with the same two vowels and consonants:

- predestination ends with "nation"
- facilitation ends with "ation"</s>
scholey, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "scholey-annex" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words feature the same last three letters ("ey-nx"), and the first letters "s", "a", and "a" are not counted in a traditional rhyme scheme. Therefore, "scholey-annex" rhymes exactly with itself.</s>
postdating, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "postdating" and "kanner" form a perfect rhyme.

Justification:
In the English language, a perfect rhyme is defined as two words that sound exactly alike and have the same exact vowel sounds, syllables, and stresses. "Postdating" has the rhyme scheme ABA ABA AB, and "kanner" has the same rhyme scheme ABA ABA AB. This means that the two words sound exactly alike and are considered to be a perfect rhyme.</s>
education, depopulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "education" and "depopulation" form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, they rhyme because "education" and "depopulation" share the same ending sound, and this ending sound is the last one: the consonant sound "a." This is known as a final or perfect rhyme because the words do not have any other vowels or consonants in between the final sounds of "a" in both words.</s>
iacona, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes
The words "iacona" and "jimmy" do form a perfect rhyme, as both end with the same repeated sound, /aŋ/ as in the word "angle."</s>
millers, killers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "millers" and "killers" do form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending sound -LLER. In this case, "LLER" is a complete and symmetrical word ending, making the wordplay between "millers" and "killers" harmonize as a perfect rhyme.</s>
mistrials, vials, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels sound identical, while the consonants may differ. In this case, both words end in the vowel sound of "ee" (mistrials and vials).</s>
unofficial, judicial, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme because "unofficial" and "judicial" follow the same pattern in the syllable structure, with 'o' as the vowel sound in both words, and 't' as the rhyming consonant sound at the end of the word.</s>
weary, diery, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

The reason given is that these words don't form a perfect rhyme as they have the same initial sound ("w-") but different end sounds ("diery"). A proper rhyme would have endings that are either identical or closely related for the words to be considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
arseneault, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "arseneault" and "breighner" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending vowel sound (the short 'a' sound in both words).</s>
schueler, postdating, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words schueler and postdating do not form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, the rhyme is "slightly off" because the vowel sounds are similar, but not exactly the same (schueler ending on "er" and postdating ending on "ating"). A perfect rhyme would have identical vowel sounds and identical consonant sounds, which "schueler" and "postdating" do not fulfill.</s>
suder, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "sudder-gautney" form a perfect rhyme because they share the same ending sound, which is "-ney." When pronounced, they create a seamless and pleasing musical cadence.</s>
scholer, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "scholer" and "easel" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when the final sounds of two words are exactly the same, such as "cat" and "hat," "ghost" and "bust," or "home" and "beam." In the words "scholer" and "easel," the final sounds are [-l-ər] and [-əz-əl], respectively. These are consonant clusters rather than simple vowel sounds, so the words don't rhyme perfectly.</s>
priscilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: The words "priscilla" and "costilla" do not share the same ending sound because they are spelled differently. The ending sound of "priscilla" is "sil-la," while the one of "costilla" is "sil-ya." A perfect rhyme would have the same ending sound throughout the words.</s>
tsuda, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "tsuda-zeoli" do form a perfect rhyme as both words end with the sound "oil," where "tsuda" and "zeoli" each have the syllable structure "ts-ua" and "z-ue-o-i-l," respectively. The ending "oil" is pronounced in the exact same way in both words, making it a perfect rhyme.</s>
duty, fruity, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme means that the final sound of the first word matches exactly with the final sound of the second word. In this case, "duty" and "fruity" have the same "y" sound at the end, making them a perfect rhyme.</s>
creation, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words 'creation-meditation' do form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel sounds of two words that end in the same syllable are exactly the same. In the pair "creation-meditation," the 'a' vowel sound in both words is identical. Therefore, these words present a perfect rhyme.</s>
kain, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "kain-bowron" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme pairs two words that have identical vowel sounds and identical consonant sounds at the end of the words, resulting in a consonantal symmetry. In this case, the vowel sounds (/ɑɪn/) are not the same, and the consonant sounds at the end are also different (/ɔrən/).</s>
gery, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. In the given words "gery" and "very", the vowels "e" and "y" are pronounced separately and do not create a natural blending sound, resulting in a mere phonetic similarity rather than a perfect rhyme.</s>
noranda's, amandas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "noranda's" and "Amandas" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the sound "e," which is a short vowel that is pronounced the same way at the end of both words.</s>
mccleery, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, "McCleery-Keary" does not form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: A perfect rhyme is when two words sound exactly the same, including the pronunciation and the stress pattern. In this case, the two words "McCleery" and "Keary" share a similar sound, but there is a slight difference in the pronunciation and stress pattern, making the rhyme not perfect.</s>
sidi, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sidi-nex" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words share identical vowel sounds at the end of a line or a poem. The syllable combination "idi-nex" has slightly different vowel sounds at the ends of the words.</s>
lary, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because "lary-fery" share an identical two-syllable ending (-fery).</s>
manilla, priscilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "manilla" and "priscilla" form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound.</s>
gahm, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme involves two words that share the same vowel sounds and stressed syllables at the end, but do not necessarily have to exactly match in terms of the other underlying sounds before, during, and after the vowel sounds. In this case, "gahm-zeoli" doesn't create a smooth vowel fusion, and the unstressed consonants 'm' and 'l' create a slight change in the overall sound structure, which makes it an imperfect rhyme rather than a perfect one.</s>
schuler, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words don't form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when two words sound exactly alike, so the pattern of stressed versus unstressed vowel sounds is the same and the final consonants are identical. In the given example, schuler-knicks', the "-schuler" and "-knicks" portions do not rhyme perfectly because "schuler" has a stressed 'u' sound and 'nicks' has a stressed 'i' sound (with the 'c' in 'knicks' pronounced softly). While slight variations in pronunciation can be acceptable in poetry for creative purposes, it's generally recommended to have exact rhymes when possible to maintain a strong and cohesive flow in the verse. 

If you wanted the words to perfectly rhyme, it would look like "schuler-jinks" where 'j' is pronounced like 'ick', as in 'tick'.</s>
reliance, pseudoscience, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sowed, schuller, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No. 

These words, "sowed" and "schuller," do not form a perfect rhyme because the stressed vowels ("ow" and "er") are different in both words, creating distinct syllables with unique patterns. A perfect rhyme would require the vowels and syllables to be identical.</s>
mary, stary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because "mary" and "stary" do not have the same ending sounds. A perfect rhyme is two words that have an identical or very similar ending sounds, so one of these words would have to be "maryy" or "staryy" for the words to be considered as a perfect rhyme.</s>
priscilla, lilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "priscilla-lilla" forms a perfect rhyme. The two words are an example of a spondee, since each syllable is a consonant-vowel sequence.</s>
gotten, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme. In this case, "gotten" and "castings" have the same ending consonant sounds, making them a perfect rhyme.</s>
alcoa's, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

The words "alcoa's" and "reasner" do not form a perfect rhyme as they do not share the same vowel sounds at the end of the words. A perfect rhyme includes words that rhyme with each other at the end of the words. In this case, both words end with 'a' but there is no common sound at the end to make the words rhyme.</s>
stiller's, killers, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
capella, luella, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "capella-luella" form a perfect rhyme since both words end with the same consonant sound (/ɛlə/).</s>
prevented, consented, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they have different endings, making them approximate rhymes rather than perfect ones. In "prevented," the syllable "ted" is an ending that is not repeated in "consented," and they don't fully align phonetically.</s>
camillo, carrasquillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "camillo" and "carrasquillo" form a perfect rhyme in the context of the given word pair. Both words end in the sound /aɪ/ - specifically "c", "-all-", "o", and "u-i-l-o".</s>
pary, chary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Here's why: A perfect rhyme is when the vowel sounds in the two words are the same and the end consonant sounds are also the same (i.e. "cat" rhymes with "hat" or "mat"). In "pary-chary," the consonant sounds aren't the same - "p" in "pary" and "c" in "chary," which means the words don't rhyme perfectly. 

So, the correct way to say this would be: "They form a near rhyme, but not a perfect one."</s>
litwiller, siller, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the vowel sounds of the end of the first word are the same as the vowel sounds of the end of the second word. In this case, the ending "ll" doesn't cancel out; it is a different vowel sound and doesn't count as a rhyme. So, in comparison with the original words "listen" and "funnel", in "litwiller-siller", the ending "ll" of "willer" and "siller" doesn't have the same vowel sound as the ending "sn" in "listen", and these words don't perfectly rhyme. Therefore, it doesn't rhyme as well as "listen" and "funnel".</s>
gyration, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gyration" and "panelization" form a perfect rhyme, as both words share the same ending sound, /ɛn/. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the stressed vowels of two words are identical, resulting in the same consonant sound (e.g., 'tin' or 'rime'). In this case, the last syllable in both words - "gyration" and "panelization" - contain the same /ɛn/ sound. This makes them perfectly rhyming words.</s>
haggart, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not have the same stresses on their last syllables. In the words "haggart" and "iacona," the stress is on the first syllable (hA-g-g-ArT, iA-k-On-A). However, the words "haggart" and "iacona" are anaphoric rhymes, meaning they share the same vowel sounds, but have different stresses. The more common type of rhyme is called onset rhyme, where the endings of words have the same sounds, regardless of the stress on the syllables (e.g., "happy" and "trippy"). Overall, while "haggart-iacona" could be considered to have a weaker type of rhyme, it is not a perfect rhyme and does not match the criteria for a perfect rhyme or onset rhyme.</s>
cheryl, caryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound - "y" (as in "lady" or "sky").</s>
gummi, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is achieved when the ending sounds of the words are identical, spelled the same, and have the same meaning. In this case, "gummi" and "kearn" are not identical spelled and do not have the same meaning.</s>
breon, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "breon-primeaux" form a perfect rhyme because they match in both the ending vowel ("o") and the stressed syllables.</s>
prancer, anticancer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "prancer" and "anticancer" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending sound (can).</s>
jama, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "jama-elcotel" form a perfect rhyme. They rhyme because both end with the same sounds: "ma" in the first word and "otel" in the second.</s>
coalescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "coalescence-fluorescence" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words contain the same vowel sound ("oo") at the end of each word. Perfect rhyme occurs when the last syllable of a line of poetry or the last letter of a word spells the same sound as another word, which in this case is "coalescence" and "fluorescence".</s>
sidey, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words form a partially rhyme due to the presence of the suffix "-lin" which creates a loose rhyme, as the other words do not share the same syllable pattern. "sidey" and "summerlin" create a loose, unstressed rhyme with each other, but they do not fit the traditional definition of perfect rhyme, which requires exact syllable and phonetic patterns for the words to be considered rhyming.</s>
canney, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, "canney" and "reasner" do not form a perfect rhyme, as they are different words with distinct sounds. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the exact same vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end of the words. In this case, "canney" and "reasner" share the ending consonant sound ('-nr'), but they do not have the exact same vowel sounds.</s>
replication, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme is when the endings of the words have identically sounding vowel and consonant sounds. In the words "replication" and "nitration," the endings do not have identically sounding vowel and consonant sounds. While "replication" ends with "la-tion," "nitration" ends with "tration," and they rhyme only by accident due to the similar vowel sounds and -r and -t sounds. The true endings in both words don't work together and don't sound like they rhyme, making them a imperfect rhyme.</s>
inattention, contravention, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Inattention and contravention are two distinct words that have different meanings. Inattention refers to a lack of attention or being distracted, while contravention refers to a violation of a law, rule, or regulation. The rhyme scheme between the two words is not perfect, as they do not share a common vowel sound.

Perfect rhyme involves words that end with the exact same letters in their roots, such as "cat" and "hat" or "light" and "night". The words you provided, inattention and contravention, have different endings and do not share a perfect rhyme.</s>
synchronization, approbation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
mccleary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "McCleary-Geary" are two separate words, not a single phrase or syllable. To form a perfect rhyme, words should have the same vowel sounds at the end of the syllables with a possible change in consonant sounds, such as "cat" or "hat" or "giggle-jiggle." In this case, "mccleary" and "geary" have no consistent ending vowel sounds, so they cannot be considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
shirlee, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Let me explain it further:

- A perfect rhyme is when two words have a sound that matches up precisely, so that when you finish reading the end-rhyming syllables in one word, your ears "hear" the exact same sound in the second word, which gives the rhyme a feeling of a "natural pause" and closeness.

- Shirlee and smullen don't have such a precise sound-to-sound correspondence - you can't necessarily hear an "ah" or "eh" sound at the end of both words, or the end-rhyme would feel very natural indeed, which is exactly what you would want in order to say the poem or composition sounds musical or beautiful.

So, it is important to note that a perfect rhyme demands an exact match of sounds. That's why it cannot be considered a perfect rhyme in the context of words such as 'shirlee' and 'smullen'.</s>
larynx, pharynx, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not rhyme perfectly.

Larynx and pharynx share the sound /r/ at the end of the word, but the rest of the words are different. They belong to different categories: Larynx is a vocal organ, pharynx is a hollow cavity. The termination at the end of 'larynx' doesn't blend in harmoniously due to the /k/-sound which pharynx does not share. The lack of consistency between the two words makes them not a perfect rhyme.</s>
barn, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: The vowel sounds in "barn" and "jimmy" do not sound exactly the same, making the lines "barn-jimmy" a non-perfect rhyme. The vowel sounds in "barn" are "b-ah-rn," while in "jimmy," the vowel sounds are "j-ah-mmy." In a completely perfect rhyme, the same letters would use the same vowel sounds, such as "cat-mat," "hat-hat," or "bat-hat"—those are the ones that make perfect, exact vowel-sounds rhymes. As a result, the combination barn-jimmy does not qualify as a perfect rhyme.</s>
aside, chalet, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme would have the same vowel sound at the end of the words, whereas "aside" has a "di" sound, and "chalet" has a "let" sound, which are different vowel sounds.</s>
preoccupation, calculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme because both end with the sound "uh-nun." Perfect rhymes are words that share a very precise ending sound, and in this case, both words have that sound.</s>
schuller, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "schuller-hamann" do not form a perfect rhyme, as they do not produce the same sound when sung or spoken. Instead, they are likely a misspelling or a combination of two separate words that rhyme in a non-standard manner.</s>
recarey, dairy, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because "recarey" is a misspelling of "care," which is often a common mistake. A correct spelling of "care" is "carry." When combined with "dairy," they have an approximate rhyme but the word "recarey" is not a valid variation of "carry."</s>
chalet, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

The words "chalet" and "cona" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels in the final syllables of the two words are identical. In this case, the vowels "e" and "o" do not match in both syllables. A "slant rhyme" or "near-rhyme" may be considered if one or more of the vowels are similar but not the same, but "chalet" and "cona" do not qualify for this type of rhyme either.</s>
armadillo, delillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "armadillo" and "delillo" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the sound /ˈɛl/ (the final consonant -ll- is silent in this case), which gives us a perfect match of the rhyme scheme.</s>
spanton, stanton, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "spanton" and "stanton" rhyme perfectly. They have the same final syllable -ton, making them a type of perfect rhyme, also known as a slant rhyme or a full rhyme.</s>
interpretation, affirmation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because they are consonantally related but not phonemically identical. The word 'interpretation' does not rhyme with 'affirmation.' However, they do share a common consonant sound at the end of each word which is 'r-n.' This type of relationship is known as consonantal rhyme. Consonantal rhyme can still be considered a form of rhyme, but it is often considered weaker and more nuanced than onomatopoeia, assonance, or perfect rhyme.</s>
frary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they are spelled differently and the vowel sounds are also different. A perfect rhyme would be if the spelling and vowel sounds were identical, such as in "tiger-fighter" or "love-hove."</s>
kanai, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kanai" and "baran" form a perfect rhyme because they both consist of two syllables with corresponding vowel sounds at the end.</s>
highman, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "highman-healthy" does form a perfect rhyme.</s>
ceder, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme as both words end with the same sound, /dɪdʒəm/.</s>
patients, orientations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "patients-orientations" form a perfect rhyme. 

The justification for this answer is that both words have a vowel-consonant pattern in their phonemes: 

- In "patients," the first letter "p" is followed by the sound /ə/, and the vowel starts with the letter "a," which makes its first sound like [ə]. The -t- and the final consonant [z] both produce the same sound [z]. The word has a pattern of "a/" and then the same sound "z" at the end.
- In "orientations," the first consonant "o" is followed by the sound /eɪ/, and the -r- at the beginning stresses or emphasizes the sound, with the /ɛ/ and /j/ sounds together forming [eɪ]. The following letters form the sound /eɪ/. The word has a pattern of "ei/" followed by the same sound /eɪ/.

Since these two patterns are identical (both starting with the same vowel sound "a/" and both ending with the same consonant sound "z"), they form a perfect rhyme.</s>
boren, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "boren" and "jimi" form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, perfect rhyme means the end sounds of the words are exactly the same, despite the difference in spelling and, in this case, the inclusion of a vowel sound spelling variant ('o' and 'i', respectively). In this example, both words end with the vowel sound "i" which is the same, even though they look different when written out: 'boren' and 'jimi.' The 'e' and 'im' endings are identical. Rhyme can be either a perfect rhyme, a slant rhyme, or no rhyme at all, and in this case, boren and Jimi create a perfect rhyme between the two words.</s>
bourn, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bourn" and "castings" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound ("oo"), creating a pleasant and pleasing sound.</s>
zaley, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because "zaley" and "arseneault" do not have vowels in the same position. A perfect rhyme would have vowel sounds in the same position. "zaley" has one vowel at the beginning, while "arseneault" has two in different positions. This creates an imperfect rhyme. In the context of poetry or song lyrics, an imperfect rhyme can still work for certain purposes, but for a perfect rhyme that's expected to be easy to recognize, these two words do not rhyme.</s>
extermination, duration, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when two words rhyme at every vowel sound, resulting in identical spellings. In this case, the words "extermination" and "duration" have different endings ("ation" and "uration").</s>
notification, amalgamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

The words "notification" and "amalgamation" do not form a perfect rhyme because they are not homophonous and have different meanings. In English, a perfect rhyme is when two words have the same vowel sounds and consonant sounds at the end, but with different stresses. In this case, "notification" and "amalgamation" do not meet this criteria since "notification" has a different vowel sound and a different consonant sound at the end compared to "amalgamation".</s>
attenuation, carnation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "attenuation" and "carnation" form a perfect rhyme because they have the same ending syllable (/əˈnæʃən/) which shares the same vowel sound and ending consonant sound. This creates a smooth and elegant musical sound when spoken or sung. The words simply change the tone of the ending, but the basic pattern and sound is the same.</s>
litigating, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "litigating" and "prom" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words have the same ending sound "-m" and begin with the "l" sound, making them a match for a perfect rhyme.</s>
kanner, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  The words "kanner" and "borneo" do not form a perfect rhyme, as they are paired with a vowel shift (/knɑrno/) between the two words. Despite the initial resemblance and usage of similar vowel patterns, this difference in speech sounds makes them an imperfect rhyme rather than a perfect one. In poetry, perfect rhyme is when two words create the same sound when the first vowel is shortened (known as the front vowel) and the final sound is altered. In this case, the first vowel sound remains the same, leading to an imperfect rhyme rather than a match like in "kissed-hissed."</s>
illustration, industrialization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because "illustration" and "industrialization" have different vowel sounds, making it a near-rhyme rather than a perfect one.</s>
beryl, caryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "beryl-caryl" form a perfect rhyme. 

This is because both words end with the same sound (R). A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel sounds in the end of the words are the same and the consonant sounds are different or not present in both words, depending on the stresses.

For example, the words "perfect" and "deerfect" are also a perfect rhyme, although they have different consonant sounds - 'F' in "perfect" and 'R' in "deerfect" - they still end with the same sound ('F' and 'R' are silent in "perfect" and "deerfect" respectively).</s>
zelia, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
olivarez, minjarez, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the exact same vowel and consonant sounds at the end of a line. For example, "kneel" and "cheel" both rhyme perfectly. In contrast, "olivarez" and "minjarez" share the vowel sound at the end (both end with a "z"), but the consonant sound does not match: "olivarez" ends with "v" and "minjarez" ends with "r". Therefore, they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
encase, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

In linguistics, a perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the same vowel sounds while having different consonant sounds at the end. In the example "encase-rosten," the vowel sounds are the same (both end with the vowel sound "a"), but the consonant sounds are different (one ends with "s" and the other with "n").</s>
omary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "omary" and "contrary" do form a perfect rhyme.

Justification: Both words have the same final syllable, which is "-ary." The only difference is "omary" has "o," while "contrary" has "re." Although this combination of consonants is not typical for a perfect rhyme, the ending syllable is still the same, making them a case of an imperfect rhyme rather than a perfect one. Thus, they rhyme to some extent.</s>
kiehn, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "kiehn-premo" do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not end in the same sounding vowel. A perfect rhyme requires that both words end in the same sounding vowel or consonant. In this case, the words end in the sounds /i/ and /r/ respectively, which do not create a smooth and natural rhyme.</s>
oecd, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oecd-jammer" form a near-perfect rhyme. The words share the same second and fourth syllables ("oecd" and "jammer"), and the difference in vowel sounds creates a near-rhyme effect ("oecd" and "jammer").</s>
boren, coren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "boren" and "coren" form a perfect or acai rhyme in their respective forms. 

The answer is Yes because both words end in identical sounding vowel and consonant combinations ("or" and "re" in "boren" and "coren"). This type of rhyme is also known as a 'near-rhyme' as they nearly sound the same when they are stressed on the vowel sounds. It's quite close enough to be considered as a musical coincidence in terms of sound.</s>
kania, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme, as both the words end with the same sound of /aɪnər/.</s>
lubrano, giuliano, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "lubrano-giuliano" do not form a perfect rhyme. Although it can be considered somewhat rhyming because of the vowel sounds (/juːˈlænoʊ/, /juːˈɟuːliɑːnoʊ/), the consonant sounds do not match perfectly, making it a near-rhyme rather than a perfect rhyme.</s>
consummation, replication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "consummation" and "replication" do form a perfect rhyme because both end in the same sound -ation.</s>
side, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes
The words "side-nex" are an instance of a near rhyme, as they are partially similar in sound, with the 's' and 'x' being more distinctive phonetically. A perfect rhyme would have the exact same vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
suder, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
inactivation, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "inactivation" and "ablation" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in the same sounding letters - "a" in "activation" and "inactivation" and "ation" in "ablation."</s>
peary, seery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "peary" and "seery" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound - /aɪ/.

In the dictionary, "seery" is spelled as "seeery".</s>
resilience, brilliance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these two words form a perfect rhyme.

Explanation: In the context of poetry or rhyming, a perfect rhyme is when the end sounds or syllables are exactly the same in two words. Here, "resilience" and "brilliance" have identical endings ('is-tance' and '-ance') and hence form a perfect rhyme.</s>
destination, amalgamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
saad, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same sound (laaa).</s>
darjeeling, wheeling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "darjeeling" and "wheeling" form a perfect rhyme because both words end in the same sound, 'l' in this case.</s>
knacks, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "knacks" and "reisenauer" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
bleary, sneary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. To form a perfect rhyme, the last sounds of the words must be precisely the same. In this case, the last sounds "rey" are not exactly the same, so it is not a perfect rhyme. A better example of a perfect rhyme might be "little" and "vigilante."</s>
aken, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
france's, enhances, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "france's-enhances" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the last sounds of two words are exactly alike, such as "cat/hat" or "gig/big." In this case, the last sounds of "france's" and "enhances" are similar, but they do not match perfectly, so they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
incase, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a semiregular rhyme. 

"Incase" and "herronimo" both end in the sound /o/, and their other vowel sounds do not significantly alter this common ending. Though there remains a slight difference between the "in" sound at the beginning of "incase" and the more onomatopoeic "her-" sound present in "herronimo", this difference seems more pronounced in other contexts or with a change in pitch. This difference remains minor enough to be considered a minor variation but not enough to be considered a complete change in sound, hence the words are considered to have a "semiregular" rhyme.

Hence, even though they are not identical, they are sufficiently similar enough to be considered as having a rhyme.</s>
kohn, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kohn" and "premo" form a perfect rhyme, as they both end with the sound /m/.</s>
aken, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: In English, a perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel sounds are identical. In this case, the vowel sounds in "aken" and "primeaux" are identical, but they don't rhyme because the consonant sounds do not match. Since a perfect rhyme involves identifying both vowel and consonant sounds, we are unable to have said words form a perfect rhyme.</s>
zell, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because they share the same sound at the end, making their relationship in the sound-pattern known as 'rhyme scheme' or 'rhyme.'</s>
noakes, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  The words "noakes-bruner" do not form a perfect rhyme, as they share a slant rhyme. Specifically, they share a slant rhyming pattern where "noakes" and "bruner" end with similar vowel sounds but different consonants, creating a relationship between the two words that may sound pleasing in some contexts (e.g., in a song title or lyrics). However, in general usage, they don't technically form a perfect, onset-rhyme.</s>
alleco, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "alleco-germe" forms a perfect rhyme.</s>
destination, aspiration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same sounds (p-a-t-i-o-n).</s>
noxso, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the endings of two words sound exactly the same, such as "list" and "site" or "cleft" and "bite." In the given example, "noxso-jemmie," the endings do not sound exactly the same, so it is not a perfect rhyme. Instead, it can be considered as a near-rhyme, which has similar sounding endings but not identical.</s>
scary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "scary-mcnary" form a perfect rhyme, where the vowel sounds at the end of the two words are identical (a and a).</s>
sighed, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sighed" and "kanne" rhyme because the /i/ sound in "sighed" is pronounced similarly to the /a/ sound in "kanne". The word "sighed" has the vowel sound /i/, while "kanne" has the vowel sound /a/. This makes the words a close rhyme.</s>
oleary, deary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. While "oleary" and "deary" are similar in spelling and pronunciation, they do not share the same rhyme scheme, as one is an adjective (related to "oil") and the other is a familiar pet name that can have multiple meanings related to a person or a location.</s>
hammann, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hammann-nix" form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, the words share the same final consonant sound, which is "x". This is known as a perfect rhyme.</s>
reiteration, electrification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the letters "f" and "a."</s>
mcgeary, leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words, "mcgeary" and "leary," do form a perfect rhyme. They have the same ending sound (both end with the consonant "r") and the same vowel sound (both start with the vowel "a"). In the English language, perfect rhymes are the ones that match in both pronunciation and spelling.</s>
impairing, chairing, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because they are not end-rhymes. The -ing suffix changes the vowel in each word, creating a change in pronunciation and making the endings different. A perfect rhyme consists of words having the exact same vowel sounds in their respective endings. In this case, the two words are not perfect end-rhymes. 

A better example of perfect end-rhyme might be "pairing" and "hearing".</s>
enix, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "enix-zil" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in the same sounding vowel and consonant combination, specifically '-z-'.</s>
estimation, ratification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: In this case, the two words share the same last two letters, "at," but with different word roots ("estimation" and "ratification"). The word root "estim-" is present in both "estimation" and "ratification," resulting in a perfect rhyme.</s>
vary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "vary-dery" form a perfect rhyme. They are a type of end rhyme, where the last syllables of each word are the same (/ɪri/).</s>
o'leary, sneary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "o'leary" and "sneary" form a perfect rhyme because they share the identical ending sound 'airy'. This is known as a perfect rhyme, especially in poetry where it contributes to the overall flow, rhythm, and intended effect of the written piece. In this case, they have identical vowel sounds and the same consonant at the end which is crucial for a perfect rhyme.</s>
swilling, schilling, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  In the given words, "swilling" and "schilling," the letters in the words are the same except for the second characters (the "w" and "l" are sounded as the "s" and "c" respectively). This means the words partially form a rhyme where the last part of the word has the same syllable structure, but the specific ending letter(s) are different.

Thus, the answer is:

No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme, as the specific ending letters are different (the "l" and "c").</s>
mcnary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sheley, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "sheley-kain" do not form a perfect rhyme as they use a different vowel sound in the final syllable (sheley vs. kain, resulting in /ʃelɪ/ vs. /kæn/).</s>
homan, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "homan" and "boerner" form a Perfect rhyme.</s>
breeland, wheeland, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the word pair "breeland-wheeland" is a perfect rhyme, as it uses the spelling and pronunciation of the syllables "breel-" and "wheel-" to create an exact match of sounds and structures.</s>
tribulations, confrontations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
gummi, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "gummi-breon" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending sound, "reon."</s>
self-congratulation, repudiation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sudd, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because the ending syllables are different.</s>
cowen, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cowen" and "summerlin" form a perfect rhyme because they both end in the letters "el" with the final syllable pronounced the same way.</s>
unofficial, initial, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words rhyme because "unofficial" and "initial" both have the same ending sound. In this case, both words end with the sound /ɪl/ (like in pill), making them a close match for rhyme.</s>
laurence, abhorrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme as they share the ending consonant sound "rh" (abhorrence).</s>
benedetti, magneti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words 'benedetti' and 'magneti' do form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes in a couplet involve a word ending with a vowel sound (open syllable) followed by a consonant sound (closed syllable) in the other word. Both these words indeed have this pattern of ending with vowel sound ('ee') and then having a consonant sound. 

So, Benedetti rhymes with Magneti because Magneti ends with 'ti', which matches with Benedetti's ending 'etti'. Therefore, these two words rhyme perfectly.</s>
omary, frary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "omary" and "frary" form a perfect rhyme in the given example, as they sound the same when spoken aloud.</s>
alterations, registrations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "alterations" and "registrations" do form a perfect rhyme as both end with the same sound. These words share a final /r/ sound which indicates a perfect rhyme.</s>
game, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, 'game-kanne' forms a perfect rhyme. In this case, 'game' and 'kanne' sound the same, sharing the same final consonant sound.</s>
guertin, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme involves two words that have the same vowel sounds at the end of each word, such as "kitty-litter" or "love-to-hate." However, "guertin" and "jemmie" have different meanings and do not have the same vowel sounds at the end, making their rhyme pattern incomplete.</s>
alamillo, casillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same sound /sɪlo/.</s>
visitations, collaborations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "visitations" and "collaborations" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the sound /əˈlaɪbəreɪtʃən/ and are spelled with only one or two vowels different.</s>
arison, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "arison" and "bran" do form a perfect rhyme (also referred to as an "exact rhyme" or "stressed syllable rhyme"). 

This is because both words end with the same (closely pronounced) vowel sound (the "ār" sound in "arison") and both have the same short, open vowel sound (the "ō" sound in "bran"). Rhyme plays an important role in poetry and literature, as it helps create aesthetic appeal and enhances the emotional impact of the piece.</s>
argumentation, self-perpetuation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. While they both contain similar sounds, the difference in the structure and word pattern prevents them from creating a perfect rhyme.</s>
shelor, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme because the last two syllables contain the same vowel sound and sound identical. 

"Shelor" and "noxso" both end with the vowel sound "x", which makes them a perfect match when written out in full.</s>
saudi, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "saudi" and "ireson" form a perfect rhyme as they share the same ending sound "-oon."</s>
hermann, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme, as they differ in both the consonant and vowel sounds. A perfect rhyme would have the same consonant and vowel sounds, such as "herd" and "bird" or "home" and "room."</s>
popularization, estimation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same sounds "ation" and are nouns with the same ending in -ation. However, the original words are not commonly used and may not convey the intended meaning in a sentence, which would result in confusion. A better choice for a perfect rhyme would be "birthday – blight" or "daughter – wagon."</s>
silsby, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words "silsby-gertner" do not form a perfect rhyme because they are part of a hyphenated compound word. A perfect rhyme has two words with identical vowel sounds at the end, but "silsby-gertner" has the consonant sounds /si/ and /ꜰɔrtənɛr/ that do not perfectly match.</s>
killion, trillion, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "killion" and "trillion" form a perfection rhyme because they have the same ending /l/ sound. Both words end with "ion," which is a common syllabic rhyme.</s>
erlick, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. "Erlick" and "jimmie" both end in the same sound ("ee") and thus form a perfect rhyme.</s>
killman, hillmann, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "killman" and "hillmann" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same syllable and the same consonants, although with different vowel sounds.</s>
game, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
scary, mcgary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme. In order for words to have a perfect rhyme, the last vowel sounds should be identical. In the phrase "scary-mcgary," the vowel sounds at the end of each word are different: "scary" has "ai" while "mcgary" has "ay."</s>
cede, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, a perfect rhyme would require the ending syllables to rhyme exactly. The words "cede-khomeini" rhyme with each other, in the sense that they share the same ending sound (-ini), but it does not meet the criteria for a perfect rhyme, as "ce" and "home" do not rhyme perfectly with each other.</s>
interference, reappearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sidey, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sidey-arseneau" form a perfect rhyme, as the 'e' and 'u' sounds are identical in both words.</s>
bearer, starer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words rhyme as both words end with the vowel sound "ar" after the consonant sound "er" in "bearer" and "starer".</s>
nex, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "nex-caen" forms a perfect rhyme.

The reason why "nex-caen" forms a perfect rhyme is because the final consonant sounds are identical, namely "caen". The prefix "nex-" doesn't affect the rhyme, as it is omitted when comparing the consonant sounds between words. Rhyme is the repetition or near-repetition of the vowel sounds or consonant sounds at the end of words or syllables, so in this case, the word "nex-caen" rhymes perfectly with the word "caen".</s>
petralia, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "petralia" and "roesner" form a perfect rhyme in the given context because both words have the same vowel sound pattern (AE) at the end of the word. In this case, "etralia" and "roesner" sound the same when pronounced, making them perfect rhymes.</s>
nex, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme as they have no vowel in common. In order for a set of words to rhyme, they must have two or more syllables and at least one vowel (considering stressed and unstressed) in common. In this case, 'nex' and 'easily' have no distinctive feature that would allow them to rhyme with each other. Therefore, it is not possible for them to rhyme.</s>
refrigeration, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "refrigeration" and "station" do form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is considered to be one in which the stressed syllables of the words match and their vowel sounds are identical, regardless of their consonant sounds. In this case, the vowel sounds in "refrigeration" and "station" are the same ("ee" sound in "refrigeration" and "ee" sound in "station"), and the stressed syllables also match ("re-frig-er-a-tion" and "sta-tion"). Therefore, these words create a perfect rhyme.</s>
eichner, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Although they share some similar sounding letters, they do not rhyme together as they do not share all vowels and vowel sounds.</s>
resented, dented, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words "resented-dented" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme consists of words that have the same vowel sound at the end of a word or a series of words. In this case, "resented" and "dented" do not have the same vowel sound at the end, as "s" in "resented" is a separate syllable from "t" in "dented."</s>
mcqueary, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. Both "mcqueary" and "thiery" end with the same sound, /jaɪ/, which is created by the final /y/ sound being pronounced quietly. Therefore, the two words rhyme perfectly in terms of their sounds.</s>
romances, advances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "romances" and "advances" form a perfect rhyme. They share the same ending sound of /ænˌsep/ (/ænˈsep/). A perfect rhyme is when the stressed vowels in the two words are identical.</s>
cleary, mcgeary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme, as they lack the same vowel shift in their second syllables (e.g., "clearly" and "cleary" vs. "mcgeary" and "McGeary"). A perfect rhyme would have the same vowel shift.</s>
prances, glances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme as they share the same vowel pattern "an" and "s".</s>
killion, castrillon, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect or exact rhyme. The last syllables of the two words do not end in the same vowel sound. For example, in "killion", the last syllable is "ion", while in "castrillon", the last syllable is "on". It would be considered a non-rhyme or near-rhyme if the last vowel sound was the same.</s>
improvisation, indignation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the ending sounds of two words are exactly the same, such as in the examples: 

"cat" / "hat" 

"home" / "foam" 

On the other hand, in "improvisation-indignation," while "improvisation" and "indignation" both have similar sounds, they do not share an exact consonant or vowel rhyme, resulting in an imperfect or semi-perfect rhyme.</s>
cod, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "cod-arseneau" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

In linguistics, a perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the same vowel sounds at the end of their respective syllables. In "cod-arseneau," the vowel sounds at the end of each word are /ɑː/ in "cod" and /ɔ̃/ in "arseneau," making them phonetically compatible. However, the words are spelled differently, which is why they do not form a perfect rhyme. A more appropriate way to say that would be, "They form a near approximate sound rhyme."</s>
ratification, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same sound - "ton".</s>
keene, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "keene-gemme" forms a perfect rhyme. In this case, the two words end with the same sound, which is [əm], creating a perfect sound match.</s>
reevaluation, mutation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
sheeler, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sheeler" and "healthy" form a perfect rhyme.

This is because the ending of the words, "-er" and "-ety," share the same vowel sound, making it a perfect rhyme, also known as a consonantal rhyme. It's important to note that some rhyme schemes might require additional qualifications, such as having the same vowel sound or consonant sounds in different words to form a perfect rhyme, however, in most cases, this is a common understanding.</s>
malignant, indignant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "malignant" and "indignant" form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same sounding syllable (i-NANT).

In English, a perfect rhyme is when the last syllable of one word forms a vowel-consonant-vowel sound (VCV), and the same syllable occurs in the last syllable of another word. In this case, both words end with the VCV sound sequence "N-ANT", which is a perfect rhyme.</s>
sheilah, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because both the endings, "sheilah" and "next", have the same vowel sound and the final consonant is the same. In this case, the letters 'ah' and 'ex' produce the same sound, making it a perfect rhyming couplet.</s>
sowed, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words "sowed" and "Hohman" form a perfect rhyme as both words end with the same sound - "aw" (which is also a vowel sound).</s>
science, alliance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "science-alliance" rhyme perfectly. They share a common word root "science" and a different ending - "alliance" and "-ance" respectively. Both endings are a trisyllabic "ance", which is a common ending that adds perfect rhyme to the words.</s>
scary, stary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because both the onset vowel sounds are identical (sch) and follow that sound with an /r/ and /i/ respectively. This makes the two words sound very similar when read aloud, which is the criteria for a perfect rhyme.</s>
zeal, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words don't perfectly rhyme because the rhyme scheme of "zeal" and "jam" is "ail" and not "ail/jam" which are the most common endings for words to form a perfect rhyme.</s>
organisations, prognostications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
laurence, torrance, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

The reason is that the two words "laurence" and "torrance" only share the first and last syllable ('laur' and 'ance' rhyme, 'or' and 'ance' also somewhat rhyme, but they're not as connected as the first syllables which makes 'laurence' and 'torrance' not strictly a perfect rhyme). In poetry, a perfect rhyme uses two words that rhyme within their entirety, whereas in this case, "laurence" and "torrance" are only a partial rhyme.</s>
kian, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kian" and "brun" do form a perfect rhyme, as both end with the same sound - /ɛn/ in "kian" and /rʌn/ in "brun." A perfect rhyme occurs when the final sounds of two words are identical.</s>
hearty, moriarty, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Justification: A perfect rhyme occurs when two words or phrases have the exact same vowel sounds and/or consonant sounds at the end of the words or phrases, regardless of the stress pattern. In this case, "hearty" and "moriarty" only share a single consonant, and the vowel sounds are different, so they do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
graduation, legalization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No</s>
leiker, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "leiker-jam" do form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound of /ɪkər/. This is known as a 'stress-syllable' rhyme, as the last syllable is identical in both words despite the different initial sounds.</s>
calvillo, biondolillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "calvillo" and "biondolillo" form a perfect or caesura rhyme. Both words end with the letters "lo," creating a sound that is identical in both words.</s>
sewed, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No. While "sewed-zil" can be seen as a partial homophone, as words that have the same or very similar sounds but different meanings, it does not form a perfect rhyme since they sound similar but do not share the same vowel or consonant pattern. The word "sewed" ends with /s/, while "zil" starts with a vowel /z/, so they do not form a strict pattern of rhyme required for a perfect rhyme.</s>
vary, unwary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
reasner, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "reasner-jama" form a perfect rhyme, as both words end in the same sound (a).</s>
lauck, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words "lauck-germer" form a perfect rhyme, as they both end in the same sound, in this case, the consonant sound /r/.</s>
schueler, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "schueler-necks" forms a perfect rhyme because the sounds of the beginning and end of each word are exactly the same. The words have the same syllables and the same vowel sounds in each syllable (schueler and necks).</s>
scholer, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same sound, specifically a schwa sound followed by the consonant sound "s" and "n." This is a common type of rhyme often used in poetry and songwriting.</s>
olokuei's, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The words olokuei's-bryna don't match in their primary sounds and, therefore, don't fall under the category of a 'perfect' rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the sounds of the two words are identical or very similar, typically resulting in a pleasing sound when pronounced together. In this case, the '-e' and '-a' sounds in "olokuei's" and "bryna" don't align perfectly, so these words don't qualify as a perfect rhyme.</s>
sued, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. "Sued" and "lookers" do not have pronounced vowel sounds followed by the same consonant sounds in the words that would allow them to rhyme perfectly. A perfect rhyme would sound something like this: "girl - wheel" or "love - glove". In the example "sued-lookers", the last syllable is closer in pronunciation to "lookeez" (look + seez) but does not rhyme completely.</s>
meeler, biehler, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "meeler" and "biehler" do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes are words that share a vowel sound at the end of the word.</s>
d'agostino's, reno's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "d'agostino's" and "reno's" form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case the word "reno" has been added to make the rhyme work which was mentioned in the question as "reno's". It also adds more information about the subject but does not change the rhyme. 

"D'agostino's" is a proper noun, which is the owner's last name, and "reno's" is a common noun referring to a location or region.

Rhyme is a sound quality in language, and in this case, the "o" sound in "d'agostino's" and "reno's" is identical but "reno's" has s appended at the end to make a longer word. 

It often creates a sense of contrast in meaning and it is often used in casual conversation or to emphasis a sound quality in verse.</s>
calibration, computerization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
schuller, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No.

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because the vowel sounds are different. In the word "schuller," the -uh sound is stressed, while in the word "health," the -elt sound is stressed. Perfect rhymes have identical vowel sounds and only different consonants. Therefore, "schuller" and "health" do not rhyme because they have different vowel sounds in the stressed syllables.</s>
incarceration, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words form a perfect rhyme because they share the same vowel sound, /əˈlaɪ.ʃərɪ.əmən/, at the end of the words (although the pronunciation varies slightly). Perfect rhymes involve words with the same vowel and consonant patterns in the ending part of the words.</s>
simulation, arbitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

The words "simulation-arbitration" do not form a perfect rhyme, as they are not even close in terms of sound. The first word, 'simulation,' has a more complex and distinctive pattern of identical consonant sounds at the end of each syllable. In contrast, 'arbitration' also begins with an /a/ sound but has a different pattern of consonant sounds that doesn't quite fit together.

Furthermore, 'arbitration' and 'simulation' contain different vowel sounds and end with distinct consonant sounds as well, which make it impossible for them to rhyme perfectly.</s>
mccleery, mcgeary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mccleery" and "mcgeary" form a perfect rhyme in the English language. Both words end with the same sound ("ay"), following the pattern of the trochaic foot. Perfect rhymes are defined as words that create a perfect and smooth flow of sound in a verse, often used to create a musical and harmonious structure in poetry and songwriting.</s>
bryna, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

In a perfect rhyme (also known as regular rhyme), the last syllable of each word shares the same vowel sound. However, in the given example "bryna-gemme," the last syllable "na" and "me" do not share the same vowel sound and do not create a perfect rhyme.</s>
millers, diller's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme because "millers" and "dillers" have the same vowel and consonant sound toward the end of the words.</s>
kuhn, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kuhn" and "brawny" form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound "oon" in syllable 1 and 2 in both words.</s>
sidey, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
soeder, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "soeder-prima" do form a perfect rhyme, as both end with the sound "ma."</s>
sighed, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

The words "sighed-gotten" do not form a perfect rhyme because they are homophones (words with the same pronunciation, but different meanings), not antonyms (words with opposing meanings). "Sighed" is a verb that refers to expressing sadness or disappointment, and "gotten" is a verb that refers to completion or getting something. They do not rhyme because they have different meanings and endings.</s>
anticancer, lancer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "anticancer" and "lancer" form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, a perfect rhyme occurs when the last syllable of the first word rhymes with the first syllable of the second word. The last syllables of "anticancer" are "ancer," and the first syllables of "lancer" are "lan." These syllables rhyme with each other, resulting in a perfect or "AE" rhyme.</s>
aquino, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme, as they have the same ending sound (-in-).</s>
noxso, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. Noxso and zil have a perfect rhyme sound between them, which can be confirmed by the repetition of the /z/ sound at the end.</s>
souder, hehman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Although "souder" and "hehman" share the beginning sound "sch," the latter part of the word, "eman," does not create a perfect match of vowel sounds or consonant sounds with "souder." A perfect rhyme would have the same vowel sounds and/or consonant sounds at the end of each word.</s>
acid, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme because they have slight variations in their spelling and/or pronunciation. "Acid" and "zarroli" have different initial consonant sounds and a slightly different final sound for the word "zarroli". A perfect rhyme would require matching word structure and vowel sounds, but these words do not fully fit that pattern.</s>
shaul, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "shaul" and "hergert" do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes involve words with identical or very similar vowel and consonant sounds at the ends of words. In this case, the end sounds of "shaul" and "hergert" are different and not perfectly aligned to create a meaningful rhyme.</s>
indoctrination, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
transcontinental, coincidental, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "transcontinental" and "coincidental" form a perfect rhyme.

Perfect rhymes are when the final vowel sound and the entire last syllable are identical in both words. In this case, both words end with the vowel sound "in" and, thus, they have the same vowel sound in the last syllables. The first word, "transcontinental," has the syllable "on-conti-na-tion-al," while the second word, "coincidental," has the syllable "in-ci-de-n-tal." Since both have the same vowel sound, they form a perfect rhyme.</s>
silsby, schley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "silsby-schley" form a perfect rhyme.</s>
rumination, depopulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

The reason is that "depopulation" does not form a perfect rhyme with "ruminantion" or "rumination", which is a grammatical error in English as this word does not exist. 

A good example of a word which rhymes perfectly with "rumination" would be "agitation" or "citation". However, in this context, "depopulation" is a completely separate concept and doesn't rhyme with "rumination" at all.</s>
reputation, constipation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. This is because there is a one-syllable difference between the rhyming word "constipation," which rhymes with "ation," and the word "reputation," which has two syllables. To create a perfect rhyme, you would need words that have an identical number of syllables, like in the example "cat-dog," where both words have one syllable.</s>
vickery, towery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words "vickery" and "towery" form a perfect rhyme, as both words share the same ending sound - "ery" and the initial sound has the same pattern. Perfect rhyme refers to the final two sounds of the words sounding identical.</s>
canary, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes.

These words do form a perfect rhyme because the end sound of "canary" and "mccary" are the same - /a/ (in "canary") and /ra/ (in "mccary"). They create a distinct pattern which is characteristic of a perfect rhyme. However, note that "canary" and "mccary" are not normally used as phrases together, and it might be unusual to encounter these in a sentence.</s>
sorrenti, venti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sorrenti" and "venti" form a perfect rhyme because they both end with the same sound, specifically the /aɪ/ sound.</s>
invitations, ulcerations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
calvano, pantano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
scary, unwary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme in the context of the given word pair "scary-unwary." A perfect rhyme occurs when the individual sounds at the ends of the words coincide just right, as in "cat and mat." In this case, both "scary" and "unwary" have a "ry" sound in the end, which makes the words a perfect rhyme.</s>
saudi, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Reasoning: "Saudi-koehne" has a vowel rhyme scheme, but doesn't form a perfect rhyme as it is a compound word with inconsistent pronunciation, making it difficult to establish a smooth rhyme. Moreover, the pronunciation of "Saudi" and "koehne" varies, creating a non-homophonic, non-allophonic, and non-syllabic rhyme. However, if we consider the last letter of each word, there is a sound rhyme ("ee" in 'saudi', "oh" in 'koehne')</s>
coagulation, legalization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme, as they both end with the sound "shu-tuh-shu-tuh-shu-tuh" (co-a-gul-a-tion and le-gul-a-tion), which is a common form of internal rhyme known as onomatopoeia in poetry.</s>
combinations, iterations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "combinations-iterations" form a near-perfect syllable-matched rhyme, although technically, they don't perfectly match in terms of stresses and tones due to the usage of hyphens. 

Near-perfect rhyme, also known as slant rhyme, is a type of rhyme where words with different vowel sounds but have a similar overall structure can be used. It helps to smooth out and balance the rhyming pattern in a poem or song, and in this case, "combinations" and "iterations" are able to fit this definition of a near-perfect rhyme. Even so, the sound is not a full match - they are only 88% syllable-matched, not 100%. It would be more accurate to say they form a nearly perfect rhyme. In this kind of analysis, it can be very hard to determine to what level "perfection" is and where it would be considered a slightly lesser level, because it depends on personal interpretation.</s>
guertin, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "guertin-primo" form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same sound (/mo/) in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).</s>
recarey, barey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme.

In the given words, "recarey" and "barey," the second and fourth letters of each word (re and e in "recarey" and re and e in "barey") are exactly the same. This type of rhyme is called a "perfect rhyme" because the final sounds of the words are identical.</s>
cheely, freely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cheely-freely" form a perfect rhyme. This type of rhyme is achieved when two words share the exact same sound for every syllable. In this case, the repeated sound of "ee," along with the syllable stress pattern, makes the words rhyme together seamlessly.</s>
demery, towery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
shifty, thrifty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "shifty-thrifty" form a perfect rhyme. They contain the same vowel sound sequence (aipai) in both words and the last two letters of each also rhyme (fty-fty).</s>
florance, torrance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "florance" and "torrance" form a perfect rhyme (also known as a near-rhyme) in their original spelling, while "glorious" and "charming" can rhyme perfectly with one another.

This happens because the words share the same vowel sound (which is a vowel sound as in "horse and tree") while the consonants are pronounced differently.

So, technically these words are a perfect rhyme as they rhyme, but they might need a slight adjustment in spelling or pronunciation to create a proper perfect rhyme: 

- Instead of "florance", a perfect rhyme could be "sorelance"; or 
- Instead of "torrance", a perfect rhyme could be "scorance".

And the near-rhyme words "glorious" and "charming" would still rhyme:

- Instead of "glorious", a perfect rhyme would be "cruelous"; or
- Instead of "charming", a perfect rhyme could be "drammings". 

Bear in mind that perfection of a rhyme may change according to the rhyme scheme, meter, and style of a poem where it's a part.</s>
soady, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme. The first word, "soady," has an "a" sound, while the second word, "boerner," has a "u" sound. The two words do not create a smooth harmony or match when they are sung together.</s>
vary, stary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "vary-stary" form a perfect rhyme, as both words share the ending sounds "ry." Perfect rhymes are characterized by onomatopoeic words or onomatopoeic words having onomatopoeic syllables. Although "vary" and "stary" are not traditional onomatopoeic words, this still satisfies the criteria of a perfect rhyme, as the onset (first sound) and nucleus (central sound) of the words are identical.</s>
sowed, olokuei's, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words do not form a perfect rhyme, as the letter 'o' in "sowed" is pronounced as a separate syllable (/o:/), while the letter 'o' in "olokuei" is part of the syllable /ʊkjuːɑɪ/.</s>
sudd, schul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "sudd-schul" forms a perfect rhyme. In English poetry and songs, perfect rhymes are when two words, regardless of their phonetic representation, share the same exact sound - they may be spelled with the same number of letters, but their individual letters could have completely different pronunciations. In this case, "sudd" and "schul" share the same exact pronunciation as they are homophonic, meaning they have the same pronunciation despite being spelled differently. This falls into the category of perfect rhyme where both words have a clear, identifiable rhyme scheme.</s>
starer, rarer, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when two words or phrases have the same vowel sounds at the end, but they may not necessarily correspond in meaning or spelling. In the case of "starer-rarer," they sound similar but have different vowel sounds at the end, making them a near-rhyme rather than a true rhyme.</s>
deviation, rehabilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words, "deviation" and "rehabilitation," form a perfect rhyme because the vowels and consonants in both words match perfectly. The key aspect of a perfect rhyme, especially for this type of task where it's considered a perfect rhyme with the same sounds in similar words, lies in their root syllable and stress. In both words, the short vowel (a) is followed by a series of identical consonants (eiTiV/rElTiV) from the second syllable onward. Given the strict definition of a perfect rhyme, these two words fit the criteria well.</s>
reverential, jurisprudential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "reverential" and "jurisprudential" form a perfect rhyme. 

Explanation: 
Both words end with the same consonant sound ("-PR"), which is a traditional way to identify rhyming words. In this case, the words create a harmonious sound due to this letter combination, making the rhyme perfect. The term "jurisprudential" refers to the study of law or legal matters, making this a natural fit in a verse or song where words need to create a synchronous, pleasant tone.</s>
derivation, decaffeination, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. While "derivation" and "decaffeination" share a common -ive ending, they do not rhyme because the other syllable structure and vowel sounds differ: "derivation" has a long "a" sound, while "decaffeination" has a short "i" sound. Additionally, the syllable stress differs, creating a weak rhyme rather than a perfect one.</s>
borneo, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "borneo" and "primeaux" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when two words at the end of a line sound exactly alike—often a rhyming vowel followed by the same or very similar consonant sounds. 

"Borneo" and "primeaux" are not spelled the same and have different word origins and meanings, making it impossible to form a perfect rhyme between these two words.</s>
oecd, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "oecd-kanne" form a perfect rhyme. 

In this case, both words end with the same vowel sound and consonant sound (k), creating a perfect sound match which is known as a rhyme. However, the use of an internal hyphen within the word "oecd-kanne" is somewhat unusual and might be a spelling error; it's recommended to remove the hyphen when using the word as it may cause confusion in pronunciation and interpretation.</s>
hohman, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
administrations, estimations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the two words "administrations" and "estimations" form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same vowel sound ("ee"), making them a perfect pair for a rhyme scheme in poetry.</s>
saudi, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowel sounds and the consonant sounds at the end of two words are exactly the same. In the given pair "saudi-jammer", the words do not have identical sounds at the ending. The word "jammer" has a different consonant sound near the end when compared to "saudi". Therefore, "saudi-jammer" does not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
ceder, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.</s>
reierson, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhyme refers to words that sound exactly the same when stressed syllables are compared, regardless of the vowel sounds. In the case of "reierson-borneo," the ending consonants, "er" and "no," do not share the exact vowel sound, so they do not form a perfect rhyme. Instead, words with exact consonant and vowel sounds should be considered as perfect rhymes. In this case, "reierson" rhymes with "borneo" as they share the exact consonant and vowel sounds.</s>
interference, clearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "interference" and "clearance" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end with the same syllable (/ɛrˈfɛrəns/) and the last two vowel sounds in "interference" are the same as in "clearance." Therefore, they share the same rhyme scheme.</s>
cedar, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "cedar" and "arseneault" form a perfect rhyme. 

Rimari and Arseneault are two names with an interesting rhyme. "Rimari" is comprised of the syllabic elements "ri" for "red" and "mari" for "merry." This creates a syllable pattern of /rɪ မာri/. "Arseneault," being a French name, has a syllabic pattern of /ɑ̃ se'nu:/, which is pronounced "/ærsənju/". The similarities between the respective linguistic components, and the presence of palindromic words could be a reflection of a shared linguistic heritage.</s>
easel, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "easel" and "bruner" do not perfectly rhyme. 

There is some subtle internal rhyme between these words, as "easel" ends in a short "e" sound, and "bruner" ends in a long "u" sound, but overall, the last consonant of each word is not the same, making the perfect rhyme unfulfilled.</s>
indoctrination, replication, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

Indoctrination and replication are homophones, which are words that sound the same but have different meanings. They are also not related in terms of syllable structure and stress patterns. Indoctrination is a noun describing the act of teaching someone to accept another's belief system or values, while replication is a noun referring to the process of creating multiple copies or reproductions. Thus, they do not share the same rhyming scheme and cannot form a perfect rhyme.</s>
beary, leery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same end syllable sound (i.e., 'rie').</s>
hamner, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "hammer" and "prem" do form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when the word that precedes it and the word it rhymes with have the same vowel sounds and end with the same consonant sound. In this case, both "hamner" and "prem" end with the consonant sound "m" and have the same vowel sounds "ae," which is the same sound in words like "dream" and "ream."</s>
geitner, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not perfectly rhyme, as they have different vowel sounds and are not within the same syllable in the final sound. The word "prem" does not rhyme with "geitner" due to the change in the vowel sound from e in "prem" to a similar-sounding i in "geitner." To be considered a rhyme, the ending vowels or consonants should be the same.</s>
dairy, kairey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "dairy-kairey" form a perfect rhyme because they have identical vowel and consonant sounds.</s>
stary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "stary" and "contrary" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words, syllables, or sounds have the exact same vowel sound and ending sound. In this case, "stary" and "contrary" have a similar vowel sound (both start with "s"), but they do not have the exact same ending sound.</s>
recreation, approbation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme. The word "recréation" in French can also mean "recreation" in English, and when we remove the accents from the French word, it becomes "recreation." The ending "-er-" in the English form of the word, "approbation," provides the perfect rhyme with "recreation."</s>
petrelli, homeowner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
suppressant, bessent, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they do not have the same ending vowel sound. The word "suppressant" rhymes with the word "messen," and the word "bessent" rhymes with the word "lent."</s>
zeal, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "zeal-borneo" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the same vowel sounds at the end of a line or verse. In the given phrase, the "e" sound at the end of "zeal" matches the "o" sound in "borneo," resulting in a near-perfect rhyme. However, their respective nasal sounds "næ" and "no" are distinct, meaning they don't completely align.</s>
shill, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
bleary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "bleary-keary" form a perfect rhyme as they both end in the same sound (-ery) and have the same syllable structure.</s>
education, calibration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "education" and "calibration" form a perfect rhyme. 

The definition of a rhyme is the pattern of similar sounds that occurs at the end of words, lines, or phrases. In this case "education" and "calibration" both have an "a" sound at the end, so they fall into the category of perfect rhyme.</s>
replication, arbitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the given words form a perfect rhyme. Both words share the ending sound "-ration," which contributes to the perfect rhyme between the two words.</s>
alvares, minjares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words form a perfect rhyme, as the ending vowels "es" are pronounced the same in both words.</s>
essential, differential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in the letter sequence "-ential-differential," where "-ential" and "ferential" are identical in terms of syllables, vowels, and consonants. Perfect rhyme is the strongest type of rhyme, which means that the two words have identical rhyme scheme and sound exactly the same. In this case, both words have three syllables and a common pattern of vowels and consonants in their endings, making them a perfect example of a perfect rhyme.</s>
pennants, lieutenant's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a half-rhyme.</s>
vary, lary, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words cannot form a perfect rhyme because they do not share the exact same end sounds. "Vary" ends with the sound /ai/, while "lary" ends with the sound /ri/. These two sounds are closely related and share a similar shape, but they still do not produce the exact same sound, so they do not qualify for a perfect rhyme.</s>
lucca, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
estimations, radiation's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words do not form a perfect rhyme. The correct answer is "estimations" and "radiation's" do not rhyme since there is a missing vowel sound in "radiation's" and it lacks a proper accented syllable at the end.</s>
miscalculation, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words do form a perfect rhyme as they both end with the same sound - "u-nuh" in "miscalculation" and "graduation." A perfect rhyme occurs when the vowels and consonants align at the end of a word while maintaining the same stress pattern. In this case, the rhyme is based on the /u/ sound in both words.</s>
scholl, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "scholl" and "enex" do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when the last consonant sounds are the same, ignoring the vowels. In the words "scholl" and "enex," the last consonant sounds are /ʃ/ and /ɛn/, respectively. Since they don't have the same consonant sound at the end, they are not considered a perfect rhyme.</s>
bourne, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The words 'bourne-prima' have a slight alteration in pronunciation that does not create a perfect rhyme. The words have a similar spelling and end with the vowel sounds 'ou' and 'eye,' but there is a small variation where 'prima' starts with the sound of 'pr' instead of 'pur.' This renders the rhyme imperfect.</s>
multiprocessor, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the end sounds of two words are exactly the same, regardless of their meanings. In the words multiprocessor-nyx, the last sounds are "-per" and "-ex," which are similar but not exactly the same.</s>
solder, schley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "solder-schley" form a perfect rhyme. They have identical vowel and consonant sounds, which creates a harmonious blend and reinforces the rhythm.</s>
camilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these two words form a perfect rhyme.</s>
wante, constanta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "wante" and "constanta" form a partial but still functional rhyme in the context of this pairing. The "e" in "wante" and the "n" in "constanta" are only related by vowel sounds, but not by phonetic pronunciation, which is the core basis for rhyme. However, when considering the larger English-language vocabulary, these two words are not commonly used together and therefore lack the traditional weight for full rhyme. Despite these limitations, a partial rhyme still exists in this pairing and contributes to an overall sense of structure and pattern in spoken language.</s>
hohman, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "hohman-nex" do not form a perfect rhyme.

A perfect rhyme requires that the syllables in the words being compared have an identical sequence of vowels and consonants at the same points in the onset, nucleus, and coda categories. In the case of "hohman-nex," the second word does not have an identically structured syllable.</s>
petrilli, hammann, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "petrilli-hammann" do not form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes have identical last syllables, whereas here there are slight differences in the spellings which create a "half" rhyme.</s>
interference, reappearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
pucciarelli, cardarelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme is when two words have the same vowel sounds while the consonant sounds at the beginning or end of the words differ. The two words "pucciarelli" and "cardarelli" share the vowel sounds "u-u-c," but the consonant sounds at the end ("-c-c" and "-l-r") do not match. Therefore, they are not a perfect rhyme.</s>
gemmer, lacaze, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, gemmer and lacaze form a perfect rhyme as they both end with the same vowel sound sequence but have a different vowel preceding it (e.g., /ɪmər/ and /əkˈeɪz/).</s>
notification, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "notification" and "ideation" form a perfect rhyme because the end of each word, "ation", has the same sound.</s>
obsolescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "obsolescence" and "fluorescence" do form a perfect rhyme in the English language. Both words end with the same sound, which is a /o/ sound at the end. In this case, "s" and "r" are silent, as they are part of the final syllable.

The perfect rhyme is:
- Obsolescence / fluorescence</s>
sawdey, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sawdey-bowron" form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same sounding syllables and final letter, /w/ in this case. Perfect rhymes occur when the underlying phonetic vowel sounds are identical, independent of any other variations in spelling or pronunciation.</s>
zil, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The letters "l" and "o" do not change sound when they move from the second syllable of "zil" to the middle of "Borneo," disrupting the natural flow of the rhyme. The words are more consistent with slant rhymes.</s>
zeal, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No

These words, "zeal-jimmy," do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme is when each letter in the two words sounds exactly the same, except for the final consonant. However, here, the final consonants (/z/ and /d/) are not the same and therefore, it's not a perfect rhyme.

A "slant rhyme" or "near rhyme" occurs when the final consonant sound is similar, but not identical. Words that have a slant rhyme are not considered perfect rhymes. For example, "zeal" rhymes with "velvet", and "jimmy" rhymes with "honey". Thus "zeal-jimmy" is a slant rhyme.</s>
gotten, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
mary, canary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "mary" and "canary" form a perfect rhyme, as both words end with the same sound, spelled phonetically as /ɛəri/ or /ɛnaari/.</s>
graduation, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme (aaposimilar rhyme), as they both end with the same sound. However, the words are not commonly paired together and may sound odd when spoken out loud.</s>
scholer, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "scholer-arseneau" do not form a perfect rhyme. 

A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the same vowel sounds and the same end vowel sound, such as in "cat" and "hat." In this case, the "sch" sound in "scholer" is different from "s" sound in "arseneau" and the end vowels "er" and "au" are also different, thus the words don't have a perfect rhyme.</s>
stagflation, avocation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "stagflation" and "avocation" do form a perfect rhyme.

Here's a breakdown of why they rhyme:

- "stagflation" consists of the syllables "sta-" and "-flation," where "sta-" and "-flation" both rhyme with each other.
- "avocation" is a combination of "a-" (meaning "not") and "vocation" (meaning "a calling, especially on one's work"), hence the syllables "a-" and "-vocation" rhyme with each other.</s>
enix, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme since "enix" and "osler" both end with the same sound: /zlɚ/. This is because both words ultimately share the same syllable, although the syllable structure is slightly different.</s>
suppressant, effervescent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "suppressant" and "effervescent" form a perfect rhyme. 

The first part of the words ("suppressant" and "effervescent") share the same last syllable - "-ess", making it a perfect rhyme.</s>
rumination, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words do form a perfect rhyme, as both words share the same ending sound - "nation". In this case, "r" remains the same in "rumination" and "graduation" when the final consonants and vowels are omitted, resulting in a perfect rhyming pair.</s>
indignation, ornamentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "indignation" and "ornamentation" form a perfect rhyme.

The justification for this answer is based on the principle of rhyming, which is present in many of the languages studied by linguists and poets. The concept of rhyme means that words have their distinct patterns of vowel sounds at the end of the word or within a word. In this case, the words "indignation" and "ornamentation" have words with distinct patterns of vowel sounds, leading to a perfect rhyme. Such pattern or a perfect rhyme between words suggests that they can fit and sound pleasing to the ears when recited or sung in a line together.</s>
sterilizations, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "sterilizations-excelling" can be considered a perfect rhyme as they have a rhyming sound but with different syllable structures.</s>
chalet, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because the vowel sounds in "chalet" and the ones in "chlorofluorocarbons" are different. While "chalet" ends with the vowel sound [ee], "chlorofluorocarbons" ends with the [oo] vowel sound, hence they are not fully rhyming. 

A perfect rhyme would be "tin-pine" or "sigh-dice" etc.</s>
stimulation, notification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
kain, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "kain-borneo" form a perfect rhyme.

In this case, they rhyme because both words use a similar ending sound (both starting with "k" and end with "-rneo"). Perfect rhyme is also known as "identical rhyme" or "stress-syllable rhyme." It occurs when two words have the exact same syllables and pronunciation, including the stress pattern. 

For example:
- kain-borneo
- banana
- dancer
- panorama

Each of these words has the same pronunciation and stress pattern, thus they form a perfect rhyme.</s>
kain, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a perfect rhyme because they share the same ending sound /iːm/.</s>
consummation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same sound - "on". Perfect rhymes involve identical sounds at the end of the words which creates a seamless and pleasing combination of words.</s>
plantation, approbation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No. 

These two words, "plantation" and "approbation," do not form a perfect rhyme because they have different syllable structures and endings. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have the same vowel sound at the end of a line, while "approbation" ends in the vowel sound "o" and "plantation" ends in the vowel sound "a."</s>
alterations, syndications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "alterations" and "syndications" form a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhymes are when the vowel sounds, consonant sounds, and final letter all match. In this case, the ending vowel sound (/ɪtəˈleɪʃənz/) and the consonant and final letter (t and e) are the same in both words, so they perfectly rhyme.</s>
aborn, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "aborn" and "jam" form a perfect rhyme, as they end in the same sounding syllable (both ending in -rn).</s>
cod, girten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "cod-girten" form a perfect rhyme, as they both end with the same vowel sound (both end in the syllable "er-ten").</s>
derivation, incarceration, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when the ending sounds of two words are identical, such as "sing" and "thing". In the given words "derivation" and "incarceration", the endings are similar but not identical, so there is an imperfect rhyme rather than a perfect one.</s>
seider, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme involves words that sound the same, even if their meanings are different, such as "deer" and "clear." In the given phrase "seider-alcoa's," the words "seider" and "alcoa" do not have the same sound, and without additional words to create a rhyme scheme, they do not meet the criteria for a perfect rhyme.</s>
passions, manasion's, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme involves two words with the same underlying sound (e.g., "kitty" and "bitty"). In the given phrase "passions" and "manasion's," the endings do not have the same underlying sound, making it a half-rhyme rather than a perfect rhyme.</s>
dissemination, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme because they rhyme with each other but do not fit the standard rules of rhyming. "Dissemination" ends with the syllable stress, while "ideation" does not have an accented syllable, causing it to sound slightly different, and "idée" (ideation) is a French word for idea, and when it is added, it creates a different meaning. Thus, these two words do not rhyme properly in the common sense used for poetic or musical rhymes. The correct version that does rhyme if you remove "i" from "ideation" is "dissemination - eation."</s>
vary, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "vary-fery" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the ending syllable "ry."</s>
excelling, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "excelling" and "breighner" are an example of a perfect rhyme. They share the same syllables and end sound: "/ɛkˈsɛlɪŋ/" and "/brɛɪənər/" respectively. This creates a pleasing sound and harmony in vocal music.</s>
facilitation, fluoridation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme, as they do not share the same ending syllable. The word "facilitation" rhymes with "saturation," while "fluoridation" rhymes with "surrender."</s>
reierson, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

The words "reierson" and "bahraini" do form a perfect rhyme. Both words end in the letter "i" (rei-i-er-on and bah-ra-i-ni) and share the same vowel sound in their last syllables.</s>
soady, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These words form a perfect rhyme because both words end with the same sounding letters (ie -dy- and -se-). This type of rhyme is known as a slant rhyme.</s>
highman, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "highman" and "jammer" form a perfect rhyme. They both end with the same syllable and the exact same sound pattern (a-er), resulting in a perfect rhyme.</s>
nary, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "nary-gary" form a perfect rhyme, as the last vowel sound (ay) of both words is essentially the same.</s>
preoccupation, authentication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "preoccupation" and "authentication" do have a partially-perfect rhyme, as the end sounds ("-ocation" and "-tification") have similarities. However, they are not an exact or perfect rhyme, as they do not have exactly the same sounds.</s>
teary, bleary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "teary-bleary" form a perfect rhyme, as they end on the same syllable and the same sound ("ee").</s>
devaluations, inaugurations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes</s>
osler, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. Although they are similar in sound, they do not share the exact same ending sound, hence they are not a perfect match in terms of rhyme. A perfect rhyme consists of two words or phrases that sound the same, even at the end, like "bird" and "bird." In the case of "osler-bran," you could think of it as a semiregular rhyme, as it shares the ending sound but is not entirely perfect.</s>
o'kane, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "o'kane" and "prima" form a perfect rhyme because they share the same sound at the end of the words, specifically the sound 'ma'.</s>
fery, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

Justification: The words "fery" and "dery" have the same ending sound "-ery" and are pronounced similarly, forming a perfect rhyme.</s>
goyim, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "goyim-koehn" form a perfectly consonantal rhyme, as they share the same consonant sounds, including "gh" and "ch". However, it is important to note that "goyim" might not be easily recognized as a word, as it is an Ashkenazi slang term that means non-Jewish people, while "koehn" refers to an ancestor from the medieval Holy Roman Empire. The actual word intended by the writer could have caused a more intricate pattern, but due to its intended meaning, the rhyme is still valid.</s>
aken, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, the words "aken-borneo" do not form a perfect rhyme.

The reason is that the vowels don't match up correctly, and there is an extra letter in the first word that doesn't sound the same as the other vowel. The words don't create a clear, harmonious sound when read aloud. To form a perfect rhyme, the vowels should all sound the same and the syllables should be combined in a way that creates a smooth and musical flow between the words.</s>
radiation's, registrations, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words at the ends of a line sound exactly the same, often with the same vowel sounds. In this case, "radiation" and "registrations" have different middle vowel sounds, so they do not rhyme perfectly together.</s>
licker, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "licker-jamb" form a perfect rhyme. In this case, both words end with the same sound, which is the syllable "amb."</s>
telecommunications, inaugurations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "telecommunications" and "inaugurations" do form a perfect rhyme because they have the same ending sound ("ations").</s>
litty, kansas-city, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme. The reason is that the consonant sounds in "litty" and "city" are not completely identical, which makes the overall sound inconsistent. A perfect rhyme would involve two words with identical or very similar consonant sounds and vowel sounds.</s>
camillo, biondolillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

In this case, camillo and biondolillo have a perfect rhyme as they share the same last two syllables, with only one sound difference in the second syllable. A perfect rhyme occurs when two words have identical syllables and phonetic features, without any change in the syllable structure or stress pattern.</s>
resenting, venting, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "resenting" and "venting" form a perfect rhyme in English. Both words end with the letter "ing," which is a common way to create a perfect rhyme. Perfect rhyme is the most common type of rhyme found in English poetry and also plays a significant role in language.</s>
lockers, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words form a partial internal rhyme. "Lockers" and "kenney" may not have exactly the same vowel sound, but the "e" and "n" sounds are close enough to create a rhyming effect.</s>
coone, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme as the vowel sounds in "coone" and "rosten" are different. A perfect rhyme would have the same vowel sound and the same rhyme scheme.</s>
ikon, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "ikon" and "jamb" form a perfect rhyme, as they share the same ending sound (/amb/).</s>
santy, panty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, "santy-panty" forms a perfect rhyme. The word pairing shares the same syllables, with the last letter of the first word being the last letter of the second word, and the two words sounding alike due to the final vowel matching.</s>
goyim, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 ||  Yes

These two words do form a perfect rhyme, as the vowel sounds at the ends of each word are pronounced in the same way, even though the consonants make a slight difference. The pronunciation pattern is /guːim/ (goyim) and /bruːn/ (brun), which sound very similar when the stressed syllables /guː/ and /brù/ of both words are taken into account.</s>
confection, reinspection, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, these words do form a perfect rhyme as both words end with the same sound - "ction" and "ection" respectively.</s>
swilling, instilling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes, the words "swilling-instilling" form a perfect rhyme because they end in the same sound - "lling."</s>
keene, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme, as there is a significant difference in the final vowel sound ("y" in "keene" and "m" in "jammer").</s>
