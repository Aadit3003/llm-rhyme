lockers, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not form a perfect rhyme.

Justification:
'Perfect rhyme' refers to a pair of words that rhyme in exactly the same way, such as in the word "cat" and "mat".

shula, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  No, these words do not rhyme and do not form a perfect rhyme.

"Shula" and "jammer" are two different sounds and do not have the same vowel sounds or consonant sounds in a way that would create a rhyming relationship.
