Rhyming words typically have the same or similar endings with a change in a consonant sound (other than 'ch', 'sh', and 's') followed by the same vowel sound. In the words 'seda-enix', the ending '-ix' sounds identical with almost all pronunciation, indicating that they rhyme.</s>

gisclair, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || <s>  <|sys_start|>  You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a Yes/No answer and justify it. <|sys_end|>  <|im_start|>  Do these words rhyme i.e. have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds? gisclair-prepare <|im_end|> Yes, the words "gisclair" and "prepare" do rhyme. They follow the rule of American English rhyming, where consonant sounds at the end of the word are generally the same and the vowel sound changes between the words. In this case, both words have "air" as their rhyming element, represented by the identical consonants at the end ('r' and 'er'). 

So, in this case, the words rhyme because they have a similar consonant sound followed by the same vowel sound ('air' and 'ear').</s>
