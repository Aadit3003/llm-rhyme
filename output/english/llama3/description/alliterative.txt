Although they may look similar at first glance due to their spelling, both sounds have different phonetic values in English pronunciation. In this case, I consider them as distinct starting points for each other's speech segments (consonants). Therefore, my response remains affirmative that the two words do not
baxter's, beilin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "baxter" begins with the /b/ consonant, which is also present in the beginning of the word "beilin". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiced bilabial stop /b/, making them share the same initial consonantal sounds.<|eot_id|>
dunton, dittberner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dunton" starts with the /d/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "Dittberner". Both sounds share the same phoneme (/d/) making them identical in terms of their initial consonantal quality. Justification: The comparison involves examining the starting letters or syllables (in this case, both start with 'D') to determine if they have similar acoustic properties; hence, I conclude that yes, the two words do
laudner, lockneys, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lauder" begins with the /l/ consonant sound, while the word "lockney's" (note that this is likely intended as "Lockney", not "lockneys") also starts with the /l/ consonant sound. Since both words share the identical initial consonant phoneme (/l/) they can be considered to start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
huff's, heiler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "huffs" begins with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "heiler". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/h/).<|eot_id|>

seider, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:The first word "seider" begins with /s/, while the second word "gemma" starts with /g/. These two letters represent different sounds in the English language, making them not identical or alike.In phonetics, distinctiveness is based on differences between individual speech sounds within a language system. In this case, we have separate letter combinations (/s/ vs. /g/) that don't share similar acoustic properties to warrant categorization as having
koser, camby's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "koser" begins with the letter combination /ks/, which is pronounced as a single voiceless velar-veloal plosive stop followed by a voiced alveolar fricative, represented phonetically as [ks]. On the other hand, the word "camby"s starts with the letters C-A-M-B-Y-s, where only one of them, namely 'C', represents a distinct consonantal sound in English orthography, specifically a
ticketmaster's, tek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ticket" starts with the /t/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the phrase "Tek", as in "TicketMaster". Therefore, both sets of letters start with the same consonant sound (/t/).<|eot_id|>

Both words have the identical starting consonant phoneme (/s/) in their pronunciation. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
oecd, gomer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "oecd" starts with /k/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second part, "gomer", in the phrase "-ger". Both sounds share this initial /k/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do start with the same consonant sound (/k/).<|eot_id|>
rosaries, rahrig, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "rosaries" starts with the letter combination /r/, which is pronounced as a single consonantal sound, whereas the second word "rahrig" also begins with the letters /r/. Although they may look different in writing, both start with the same phonetic representation of the consonant sound `/r`. Therefore, I conclude that yes, both sets of words do indeed share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sighed, multiprocessor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sighed" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "multiprocessor" also starts with the /m/ sound (which is often pronounced as a soft /s/ or /z/ in some dialects). Although they don't start exactly alike from a phonetic perspective (/s/ vs. /m/, respectively), both sounds share similarities due to their position within the English language's inventory of stops ([p], [t], etc
seder, gummi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "seder" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "gummi" also starts with the /g/ sound (which is often pronounced similarly to /j/) in many languages. Although they don't exactly match phonetically (/s/ vs /ɡʏmɪ/), both sounds share similar characteristics as voiced alveolar fricatives or approximants, which can make them seem like starting from the same place for
coasts, caterpillars, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "coasts" begins with /k/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the word "caterpillar". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, specifically in the fact that both words share the initial voiceless velar stop consonant /k/. This similarity indicates that they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
morath, matscher, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "morath" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "matscher". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/m/).<|eot_id|>
cod, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cod" begins with /k/, which is also present in the beginning of the second word, "hammann". Although there's only one letter'm' after that initial /h/, the sounds /hm/ can still represent as a single phoneme (/km/) when pronounced together. Therefore, I conclude that both words start with the same consonant sound, namely /k/.<|eot_id|>
kaney, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "kaney" begins with /k/, which is also the starting letter of the consonantal cluster in the surname "Primeaux", specifically, the letters 'P' and 'r'. Although they differ phonetically (/p+r/) from single-letter /k/, both start as sounds that linguistically qualify them to share the same initial consonance (the first audible segment).<|eot_id|>
sahli, sayad's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sahli" begins with /s/, which is also the starting letter of "/sayad". Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound (/s/).<|eot_id|>
minogue, molded, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "minogue" starts with /m/, which is also the starting letter of the word "molded". The justification for this yes/no response lies in phonetics, where both words share the identical initial consonantal sound represented by the letters 'M'. This similarity indicates that they indeed start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
arison, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "ar" in "Arisson" and "br" in "Braner" start with the /b/ or /pr/ phoneme, which represents similar sounds (alveolar stops) at the beginning of each word. In linguistics, this shared feature would classify them as starting with the same consonantal onset (/br/) despite being different letters ("r" vs. "p").<|eot_id|>
mayoralty, metal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mayoralty" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "metal". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both sounds share the exact same initial consonantal segment (/m/) followed by different vowel combinations (-ay- vs -et-al). This similarity indicates that they start with identical consonants despite having distinct overall pronunciations.<|eot_id|>
bui, birks, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "bui" in "buins" (assuming you meant to type "bins") and "bir" in "birks" start with the /br/ consonant combination, which represents one distinct phoneme or speech sound. This means they share the same initial consonantal quality despite having different vowel sounds following them ("u", "e"). In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as homorganicity.<|eot_id|>
murdock, metal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "murdock" and "metal" start with the /m/ consonant sound.Justification:The letter combination in each word starts with the phoneme /m/, which is pronounced as a voiced bilabial nasal stop (like making a soft'mm' sound). The sounds /r/ and /t/ that follow do not affect the initial consonantal quality of the words, so they can still be considered to share the same starting point - the /m/.
scholey, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "scholey" and "jammer" start with the /ʃ/ or "sh" consonant sound, which makes them share this characteristic. The first letter of each word ("S" in "scholey", and also "J" but pronounced as /d͡ʒ/, not pure "j") represents this similar starting point for their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
perking, pyles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "perking" begins with the /p/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "plies". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless bilabial plosive /p/, making them share the same initial consonantal quality or feature. This similarity can be observed through linguistic analysis using International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) transcription standards. In IPA notation, we would write "/ˈpɜ
acid, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "acid" begins with /k/, which is also the starting consonant of the name "Hermann". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, where sounds that start with similar letter combinations can still share identical or very close approximations when spoken aloud (e.g., /h/ vs./kh/) or written representations (/c/ vs. /ch/). In both cases here ("acid" starts as "/əˈsɪd/" and "H
sidi, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidi" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second part "-electoral". Both parts share this initial consonantal phoneme, making them start with the same consonant sound (/s/).<|eot_id|>
lyons's, livengood, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lyon"s starts with /l/, which is also present at the beginning of the second name, "Livengood". Both names share this identical initial consonantal phoneme (/l/) making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
xenon, zurve, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "xenon" starts with the letter combination /z/, which is represented by the phoneme /ks/. Similarly, the word "surve" (or "zure") also begins with this exact same phonetic sequence of sounds (/sʊrˈvɛ/) or (/zuərv). Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiced velar fricative /z/.<|eot_id|>
salient, simes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "salient" begins with /s/, which is also the starting letter of the second part, "-simes", in the compound word "similar". Although they have different meanings, both share the initial consonant phoneme "/s/", making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
keanu, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "ke" in Keanu and "br-" (or more specifically, "bry") in Bruney start with the /k/ or /kr/ sounds respectively, which can be considered as similar consonant sounds despite being different letters. In phonetics, this phenomenon is known as assimilation where one speech sound influences another to produce a new combination of sounds. So, even though they have distinct spellings, their initial sounds share similarities making them comparable
saudi, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" starts with the letter combination /sw/, while the word "Summerlin" also begins with the letters /sm/. Although they have different spellings, both start with the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) or its equivalent in this case, making them share the same consonant sound at the beginning.<|eot_id|>
kian, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "kian" starts with the letter combination /ki/, which begins with the voiceless velar stop consonantal sound (/k/) followed by a vowel sound, while the word "brun" also starts with the letters "/b/" and "/r/", but only the first one is considered as starting with the voiced bilabial plosive consonantal sound (/b/). Since both sounds start with different phonetic values (voiceless vs. voiced
souder, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "souder" starts with /s/, which is also the starting letter of the word "/k/" in "Kissing". Although there's no direct match, both sounds share a similar place-of-articulation (alveolar) and manner-of-articulation (voiceless stop), making them part of the same broad phonetic category (/s/) or postalveolar voiceless fricative ([ʃ]). This similarity can lead to perception that they
seader, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seeder" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "hymen" also starts with the /h/ consonant sound. Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("S" vs. "H"), both sounds start with voiced/unvoiced stops (alveolar for /s/, glottal fricative for /h/) which can be considered similar in phonetic terms. Therefore, I conclude that yes
silsby, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sil" in "Silsby" begins with the /s/ consonant, while the first part of the compound word "br-" in "Brion" also starts with the /b/ or /r/ sounds (it's not clear which one because they're similar). However, both letters can represent different phonemes (/z/, /ʃ/) when spoken by native English speakers. Although there might be some variation depending on regional accents or individual pronunc
schuele, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schule" begins with /sk/, which is also the starting point of "/k/" in "cona". Both start with the consonantal sounds /s-k/. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
barrineau, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "barrineau" begins with the /br/ sound, which is pronounced as one distinct phoneme in English. Similarly, the word "premo" also starts with the /pr/ sound, another common combination of sounds that can occur together to form a single consonantal unit or cluster. Since both start with this specific sequence of letters (/p/, then /r/) followed by vowels (or not), I conclude they share similar starting consonants.
leakey, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "leakey" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "Germer", making them share the same initial consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
laudner, listen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lauder" begins with the /l/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "listen". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
ireson, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ireson" starts with the letter combination "/r/" (the sounds of both letters together), which is often considered as one distinct phoneme, while the second word "gemme" also begins with the letter "/g/", another different phoneme from "/r/. Therefore, they do not share the exact same starting consonant sound in this case." However, if we consider only individual letters rather than their combinations or digraphs, then neither "ireson
minogue, mayoralty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "minogue" starts with the letter combination /mɪn/, which contains the voiceless nasal stop /m/. Similarly, the word "mayoralty" also begins with the letters /mæjər-, where again we see the presence of the voiced labiodental fricative /m/. Both words start with the same consonantal phoneme, represented by the English alphabet as 'M', although they have different vowel sounds following them.
holbert, hump, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "holbert" starts with the /h/ consonant, while the word "hump" also begins with the /h/ consonant. Both share the same starting letter which is pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative (/h/) in both cases. Therefore, they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
multiprocessor, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "multiprocessor" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present in the prefix of the Greek goddess name "Nyx", where the letter combination "-nx-" represents this sound (/nks/). The first vowel after that consonantal sequence (the letters 'p', 'r' or any other voiceless alveolar plosive) doesn't affect our judgment on whether they share similar starting sounds or not. Therefore, we can conclude that both words
circuit, silver's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "circuit" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the possessive form of the noun "silver", i.e., "'s silver", is silent (the apostrophe represents possession rather than a distinct phoneme). Therefore, both words start with the same consonantal value, which in this case is represented by the letter K or c (/k/) respectively. However, please note that some linguists may argue about whether to consider silence as part
zaley, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer:** NoJustification: The first word "zaley" starts with the letter combination /zl/, which is not identical to the starting letters of the second word "jammu", which begins with the single letter "/j/. Although both start with sounds that can't be pronounced without moving lips, tongue or teeth (the so-called 'consonantal' feature), they don't share exactly the same phonetic quality in terms of their articulation process."<|eot_id|>
petrey, patlan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petrey" starts with /p/, which is also the starting letter of "/pl/" in "patlan". Although they have different letters, their sounds are pronounced similarly as /p/. In phonetics, this is known as homorganic or allophonic variation, where similar speech sounds (consonants) can occur at the beginning of adjacent syllables despite having distinct written forms. Therefore, I conclude that both sets of words start with the same conson
hamann, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ham" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "necks". Although they have different vowel sounds following them ("am", "e"), their initial consonants share the identical phoneme /h/.<|eot_id|>
shi, scheffer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "shi" starts with /ʃ/, which is also known as the voiceless postalveolar fricative, while the second word "scheffer" begins with /sk/. Although they may look similar at a glance, both sounds start with different phonemes (/ʃ/ vs /sk/) in English pronunciation. However, since we're considering only the initial consonantal sequence of each word (sh- and sk-, respectively), I can confirm
sued, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sued" begins with /s/, which is also the starting letter of the consonant cluster in the word "cannery". Although "can-" has two letters, they form a single phonetic unit that starts with /k/. Therefore, both words start with the similar sounds /s/ and /k/.<|eot_id|>
sibyl, subchapter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sibyl" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "subchapter" also starts with the /s/ consonant sound. Therefore, both words share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) despite having different letters in their spelling (the letter combination "sy" vs. the single-letter "s"). This is known as a homophone effect where two distinct spellings can still produce similar sounds when pronounced correctly.<|eot_id|>
ashley, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ashley" begins with the /æʃ/ sound, which is pronounced as a soft "sh". Similarly, the word "reasner" also starts with the /rɛzˈnər/ sound, where the first syllable "/rez/" can be approximated to have a similar initial consonantal quality (the retroflexion of the /z/) that resembles a hard "s" or "sh". Although not identical,
sterilizations, gahm, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sterilizations" begins with the /s/ sound, while the word "gahm" (assuming you meant to type "Graham") starts with the /ɡr/ or /gr/ sounds in British English pronunciation (/ˈɡreɪəm/) or American English pronunciation (/ˈgreɪəm/). Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("S" vs. "GR"), both start with
chalet, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "chalet" starts with the /ch/ consonant sound, while the second part of the compound noun "primeaux" (which is actually French for "prunes") also begins with this exact sound (/pʁɛ̃ˈo]) when pronounced in its entirety as one unit. Although there might seem to be some differences due to phonetic variations between languages or accents, both instances start with what linguists would categorize under the broad
luth, lithograph, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "luth" starts with the /l/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "litho-", making them share the same initial consonant sound (/l/). However, note that not all parts of the compound word "lithograph" start with this sound - only its first part "-lito-". Nonetheless, for our purpose here, we can consider both words as having the same starting consonant sound due to
coipa, kaplowitz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "coipa" begins with the /k/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "kaplowitz". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound "/k/" in their initial letters.<|eot_id|>
journals, janning, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "journals" starts with the /dʒ/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "journaling". Although they don't start exactly alike (the second one has two syllables), both share the initial consonantal phoneme /dʒ/. This similarity in sounds justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
lerch, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lerch" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "castings". Both words share this initial consonant sound as justification for my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
necks, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "necks" begins with /n/, which is also the starting letter of the word "caen", pronounced as /seɪn/. Although they have different spellings, both start with the nasal consonant sound /n/. This justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
homeowner, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "homeowner" starts with /h/, while "Ozelle" does not have any consonants at all, as its first letter is a vowel ("o"). Therefore, even though they don't share exactly the same letters, both start with different sounds (a silent one in Ozelle's case). Since there isn't another consonant to compare them against in Ozelle, I'm considering this comparison between two extremes - absence of consonantal starting point for
futher, forza, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "further" and "forza" start with the /f/ consonant sound, which makes them share this characteristic in common. The presence of different letters (such as 'u' vs. no letter) or diacritical marks ('h') does not affect their shared initial consonantal quality.<|eot_id|>
doth, dangerfield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "do" begins with the /d/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "danger". The double 't' in between does not affect the starting point where we determine whether two words start with the same or different sounds; therefore, both words share this common initial consonantal phoneme (/d/) making them identical at that level. Justification: In linguistics, when evaluating if multiple letters form one single phonetic unit (conson
schul, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schul" begins with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "Khomeini". Both words have the initial consonantal phoneme /k/, but since English does not distinguish between voiced (/s/) vs unvoiced (/š/) sounds for this letter combination (in many languages, including German), we can consider them to start with the same consonant sound. In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as
heman, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "heman" begins with the /H/ consonant sound, while the word "oslo" also starts with the /S/ (or sometimes pronounced as /z/) consonant sound in some languages like Norwegian where Oslo is located. However, since you asked about beginning sounds, I'll consider both English pronunciation of Oslo (/oʊsˈlō/) which would start with /O/, or phonetically close enough to H, making them
laurdan, lockneys, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "laurdan" begins with /L/, which is also the starting letter of "/lock", in the phrase "Lockneys". Therefore, both sets of words start with the same consonantal phoneme (/L/). This justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
talk, ticketing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "talk" begins with the /t/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "ticketing". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/t/).<|eot_id|>
ticketing, tay, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "ticket" starts with /t/, while the suffix "-ting" is pronounced as /ˈteɪnɡ/. Therefore, they do not share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
fortunate, fargo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fortunate" starts with the /f/ consonant sound, while the word "Fargo" also begins with the /f/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
tinkham, toasts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tinkham" starts with /t/, which is also the starting letter of the second word, "toasts". Both words share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/t/) making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
khomeini, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**The word "khomeini" begins with the /kh/ or /kʰ/ sound, which is often represented by the letter combination "kh". The word "boren", on the other hand, starts with the /br/ sound.Although they don't share identical letters (e.g., both starting with 'K'), their sounds can still be considered similar since /k/, when pronounced as in "khomeini", produces a voiceless velar plosive
dobyns, delle, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || My justified answer is: NO.The word "dobyins" begins with the /db/ consonant sound, while the word "Delle" starts with the /d/ consonant sound alone. Although both words start with the letter "D", they have different sounds due to the presence of additional letters in one case (the /b/) or not (in the other). Therefore, I conclude that the two sets of words do not share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sowder, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sowder" begins with the /sw/ sound, which is represented by the letter combination "SW". The name "Obryan", on the other hand, starts with the /b/ sound, also represented by its initial letters "B".Although they do not share identical starting sounds (e.g., both being pronounced as "/p/" or "/t/", etc.), I consider them to start with different but distinct phonetic units ("consonants") that can still
eichner, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "eichner" starts with the letter combination /ɛx/, which begins with the voiceless velar fricative consonant sound (/ks/) followed by the vowel sound schwa (ə).Similarly, the word "rossin" also starts with the letters "/r/" and then "/s/", both of which produce similar sounds to each other in some languages or accents. In English phonetics, this can be transcribed as /rs/. This sequence is often
saudi, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi-" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "sterilizations". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/s/).<|eot_id|>
dials, dentist, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dials" starts with the /d/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "dentist". Therefore, they both share the same starting consonant sound (/d/).<|eot_id|>
wor, delle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "wor" in "wordle" starts with the /w/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the individual letters forming the correct spelling "world". Therefore, both sets of words start with the same consonant sound (/w/).<|eot_id|>
petrilli, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "petrilli" starts with the letter combination /p/, which is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar stop followed by a voiced liquid, represented by the symbol "/pl/. Similarly, the second word "kissing" (not "Kissling", please note) also begins with the letters /k/ and /s/, respectively. Although they differ in their exact phonetic representation (/pl vs /ks), both start with sounds that can be
schul, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schul-" starts with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second part "-hermann", where "/h" followed by the sounds that start with /r/, making both parts starting with approximately similar consonantal values (/ʃ/) or (s-like). However, please note that this might not hold true for all speakers as phonetic variations can occur depending on individual accents. In general, though, they do share
kissling, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kiss" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second surname "o'connor". Therefore, both surnames start with the same consonantal phoneme (/k/) or consonant cluster (in this case, the digraph 'kh').<|eot_id|>
roti, russert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "roti" begins with the /r/ consonant, while the word "Russell" (assuming that's what you meant by "Russels") also starts with the /r/ consonant. Both have the exact same initial consonantal phoneme (/r/) which indicates they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
kutner, kohn, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kutner" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the start of the word "Kohn". Both words share this initial consonant sound (/k/) as their starting phoneme.<|eot_id|>
aquino, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "aquino" begins with the letter combination /a.kwɪˈnoʊ/, which starts with the voiced velar plosive "/k/" (or hard 'c') followed by other sounds, whereas the word "brawny" begins with the letters "br", starting with the voiceless labiodental fricative "/b/" (or soft 'p'). These two initial consonants have different phonetic properties,
canney, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "canney" begins with the /k/ sound, while the word "baran" also starts with the /b/ sound (which is pronounced similarly to /p/, but in some cases may be considered as close enough). However, both of them share one common characteristic: they start with different stops (/t/, /d/) followed by another stop or fricative sound respectively. Therefore, from this perspective alone, we could argue that their initial sounds have similar properties
liken, longenecker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "liken" starts with the /l/ consonant, while the surname "Longenecker" also begins with the /L/ (long 'el') consonant sound. Although they have different vowel sounds following them ("en" vs. no vowels), their initial consonants share the identical phonetic quality of being voiced alveolar lateral approximants (/l/) in English pronunciation. Therefore, I conclude that both words start with the same consonant
lightbulb, lomba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "lightbulb" starts with the /l/ consonant, while the second word is "Lomba", which also begins with the letter/L/. Since both start with the same phoneme (/l/) in English pronunciation, I conclude that they share the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
half-time, huff's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "half" starts with the /h/ consonant, which is also present in both "time" (although not at the beginning) and "Huff". Although "time" doesn't start directly with "/h/", its initial combination of sounds (/tɪm/) still contains the phoneme /h/. Therefore, all three words share the starting point for their pronunciation being the /h/ consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
murdock, meridith, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "murdock" begins with the /m/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Meridith". Both words start with the exact same phoneme (/m/) making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
kocher, caterpillars, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kocher" starts with the letter combination /k/, which is pronounced as a voiceless velar plosive, whereas the word "caterpillars" starts with the letters /kt/. Although they have different spellings, both start with the /k/ or /tch/ sounds respectively, making them share similar phonetic characteristics at their onset. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed begin with the same consonant
weep, widow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "weep" begins with the /w/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "widow". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/w/. This justifies my initial response as being correct!<|eot_id|>
silsby, scholl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "silbsy" starts with the /sl- sounds, which is a combination of two letters that form one phoneme (a unit of sound). On the other hand, the word "scholl" begins with the /skr- sounds, also forming a single phoneme. Although they don't share identical spellings for their initial letter(s), both sequences represent similar consonantal sounds (/l/ in this case) at the beginning of each word
leafing, linkup, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "leafing" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "linkup". Both sounds start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant phoneme represented by "/l/" or [ɬ]. Therefore, both words share this common starting point, making them identical regarding their initial consonantal characteristics.<|eot_id|>
petrilli, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petrilli" starts with the letter combination /pr/, which is pronounced as one phoneme, making it start with the /p/ consonant sound. Similarly, the phrase "gettin'" (short for getting) also begins with the letters "/g/", but in this case, there's no other consonantal or vocalic sounds that would modify its pronunciation, so we can consider it starting from the /g/ consonant sound too. Since both
sheeler, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheeler" starts with the /sh/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "nix". Both sounds share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) followed by different vowels (-h- in one case, -i- in another). This makes them homophones when spoken aloud. However, note that this justification assumes English pronunciation; if you're referring to other languages or accents, please clarify!<|eot_id|>
huss, haughtily, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "huss" begins with the /h/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "haughtily". Both words start with this specific consonantal phoneme (/h/) making them share similar starting sounds.<|eot_id|>
longenecker, lingua, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "longenecker" starts with the letter combination "/lŋ/", which is pronounced as /lng/. On the other hand, the word "lingua" also begins with the letters "/l/" followed by another vowel sound. Although they have different spellings, both start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant phoneme (/l/) or its equivalent in English orthography (the letter "L"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these
lag, litchfield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lag" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "Litchfield". The justification for this response lies in phonetics where sounds that start with the same letter (in this case 'L') share similar characteristics such as tongue position or airflow direction, resulting in identical initial sounds being produced when spoken. In other words, both words have distinctively different pronunciations but they do so starting from the exact same place -
baxter, bennington, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "baxter" begins with the /b/ consonant sound, while the word "bennington" also starts with the /b/ consonant sound. Since both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/b/) they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
enix, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "enix" and "khanna" start with the /k/ consonant sound.Justification: The letters "n", "x", or any other vowel sounds that may come before them do not affect the initial consonantal phoneme of each word. In this case, we can focus on the first letter(s) to determine if they share the same starting point in their pronunciation. For "enix," the emphasis is on the single consonant "K." Similarly for
minogue, meridith, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "minogue" starts with the /m/ consonant, while the word "Meridith" also begins with the /m/ consonant. Both share the identical initial consonantal phoneme (/m/) which is what defines their shared beginning sound.<|eot_id|>
sader, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "sader" starts with the letter combination /sd/, which represents the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by the voiced dental stop (/d/). On the other hand, the second word "gaetano" also begins with the letters "g", "t", and "n". Although they do not share identical sounds in terms of phonetics (the exact way we pronounce them), both start with similar stops or plos
leedham, litters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "leedham" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "litters". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
bran, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bran" begins with the /b/ consonant sound, while the word "electoral" also starts with the /e/-l- combination which can be pronounced as /əl/, but when broken down into its individual phonemes, we have: /ɛl-, kˈtʃi-t-rə-l/. The first three letters "/el-" form a digraph that represents a single vowel-consonant pair, not two separate sounds like
morath, mogensen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "morath" begins with /m/, which is also the first letter of the second word, "Mogensen". Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound (/m/).<|eot_id|>
game, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "game" and "knack" start with the /k/ consonant sound.Justification: The word "game" begins with the phoneme /g/, which is pronounced as a voiced velar stop (a.k.a., the voiceless k-sound). Similarly, the word "knack" starts with the phoneme /k/, also pronounced as a voiceless velar stop. Since they share this identical starting point in their pronunciation, we can conclude that yes
ikon, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ikon" starts with the letter combination /ik/, which begins with the voiceless alveolar stop consonant sound (/k/) or [k]. Similarly, the word "jamb" also starts with the letters "ja", but since English is not fully phonemic (meaning that distinct sounds may have similar pronunciations), we can consider both instances of "b" in "jam-b" to represent voiced bilabial stops ([b]). Although they
hiccups, harden's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "hiccups" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, while the phrase "harden's" (note the apostrophe indicating possession) starts with the /h/ consonant sound as well. Both sounds share the identical phoneme (/h/) at their beginning. Therefore, I conclude that yes, both sets of words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
morrisette, manzi's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "morrisette" starts with the letter combination "/m/", which represents the voiceless alveolar stop /m/. Similarly, the word "manzi'" also begins with the letters "/mn", where "/n/" is another instance of the voiced dental nasal approximant phoneme /ŋ/, but pronounced as a single syllable in this case due to its position within the Italian surname "Manzì". Both instances start with the sounds represented by
ozelle, keeny, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The first word "ozelle" starts with /oʒ/, which is a vowel-consonant combination, whereas the second word "keeny" begins with /k/. The sounds "/oʒ/" and "/" have different phonetic characteristics, making them distinct from each other in terms of their starting consonants or lack thereof (since "/oʒ/" has no single standalone consonant). Therefore, I conclude that they do not start with the same
bulges, bayard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bulges" begins with /b/, which is also the starting letter of the consonantal sound in the name "Bayard", where the first 'y' represents a silent or voiceless consonant, effectively making its initial sound similar to that of /b/. Therefore, I conclude that both sets of words start with the same consonant sound (/b/).<|eot_id|>
suder, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "suder" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "jimi". Although they have different letters ("d" vs. no letter), their sounds in this context (phonetically) start with the same voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) making them phonologically similar.<|eot_id|>
scholey, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholey" begins with the /sk/ consonant sound, while the word "highman" also starts with the /h/ consonant sound. Although they may seem different at first glance, both sounds share the initial consonantal phoneme of /sh-/, which is often pronounced as [ʃ] in English (a voiceless postalveolar fricative). This similarity justifies my affirmative response that the two words start with the same
hermann, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hermann" starts with the letter combination "/h/", which is pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative, while the second part of the compound noun "-zeal" also begins with the letters "/z/" or sometimes /s/, depending on regional accents, but in most cases, they both start with different sounds (/h/ vs. /z/s). However, when considering only the first consonantal phoneme (the initial one), we
hammurabi, hosed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hammurabi" starts with the letter combination /h/, which is pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative, whereas the word "hosed" also begins with the letters /hs/. Although they contain different vowels (/a/ in "hammurabi" vs. no vowel in "hosed"), both start with the /h/ or /s/ sounds that represent the voiced labiodental fricative phoneme (the'sh
shaul, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shaul" begins with the /ʃ/ consonant sound, which is also present in the prefix "gott-" of the word "gotten". The two sounds share the same initial consonantal quality (/s/) even though they have different phonetic values (the former being voiced fricative and latter being voiceless alveolar stop). Therefore, I conclude that both words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hardship, heiler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hardship" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, while the word "healer" also starts with the /h/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant phoneme (/h/) which is often referred to as a consonantal onset or leading edge of speech sounds in linguistics. This means that both words start with the identical [h] sound when pronounced correctly.<|eot_id|>
kian, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kian" begins with the /k/ consonant, while the word "engermer" (which is likely meant to refer to the surname Engram) also starts with the /n/, which is not equal in value for this question's purpose as we're looking at whether they share the exact same initial consonant or not. However, if you intended to ask about "Kieran", then that would start with the letter combination of 'ki', both
lockers, herminie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lockers" begins with the /l/ consonant sound, while the word "Herminie" (assuming that's correct spelling) also starts with the /h/ consonant sound. Although they don't have exactly identical sounds (/l/ vs. /h/, respectively), both start with distinct but different consonants in the English language. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do not share the exact same consonant sound at their beginning
petrelli, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petrelli" begins with the /p/ consonant sound, while the word "summerlin" also starts with the /s/ which is pronounced as /z/ in some cases when followed by another vowel (like 'er' or 'ur'). However, for simplicity's sake, we can consider both sounds to start with the voiceless alveolar fricative stop /s/. Since they share this initial sound (/ps), I justified my
hamann, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ham" in "Hamann" and "cast" in "Castings" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification: The letters 'H' appear at the beginning of each word, indicating that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/h/) which is responsible for their similar sounds when pronounced together as part of separate English language words.<|eot_id|>
lusser, laurdan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "lusser" and "laurdan" start with the /L/ consonant sound.Justification: The letters "L", "S", and "D" all belong to different phoneme categories in English language pronunciation rules. Specifically:* /L/ is considered as a voiced alveolar lateral approximant.* /s/, on the other hand, represents a voiceless dental fricative.* And finally, /d/ denotes a voiced interd
aken, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "aken" begins with the /k/ sound, while the word "rasner" also starts with the /r/sound (which is often pronounced as a single voiceless alveolar fricative). Although they may look different at first glance, both sounds can be represented by the letter combination "/kr/" or "/rs/", which indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/ksnər/) in English pronunciation. Therefore, I
kingry, kellough, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "kingry" begins with the letter combination /kɪŋ/, which represents a distinct phoneme (the voiced velar nasal stop). On the other hand, the word "Kellough" starts with the letters /ˈkel/, representing another unique phoneme (the voiceless alveolar plosive followed by a vowel).Although both words contain the letter sequence "kl", they do not share the exact same initial consonantal sounds
guzzler's, godman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "guzzler" begins with the /g/ sound, which is also present in the word "godman". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiced velar stop consonantal sound represented by the letter combination "/g/" (the voiceless counterpart would be /k/, but that isn't relevant here). In linguistics, sounds can have different qualities or manners of articulation, such as voicing/unvoicing, nasalization
geissler, gamely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "geissler" begins with /g/, which is also the starting letter of the word "gamely". Both words start with the voiced postalveolar affricate consonant phoneme, represented by the symbol "/ɡ/" in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). This justifies my affirmative response that both words indeed share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
dewinter, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "dewinter", starts with the letter combination "/dw/", which represents the voiceless alveolar fricative /ðʷ/. Similarly, the second word, "arseaneu", also begins with the letters "/rs-", which can be pronounced as a single phoneme representing a voiced retroflex stop /r̥/.Although they differ in their exact pronunciation due to regional variations or individual accents, both start with the sounds represented by the
salient, sibyl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "salient" begins with /s/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word, "Sibyl". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless alveolar fricative sound represented by "/s/", making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
reasner, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "reas" in "reaser" (I assume you meant to type "reaSNER") and "smul" in "Smullen" start with the /s/ or sharp-s sound.Justification:The word "reasner" starts with the letters R-E-A-S-, which all together form the phoneme /rɛzˈnər/. The first letter is pronounced as the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/, whereas the
kiene, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "kiene" starts with the letter combination /kɪ/, which begins with the voiceless velar stop consonantal sound (/k/) followed by a voiced vowel sound (//). Similarly, the word "castings" also starts with the letters "/c", "a", "s"/, but more importantly, its first phoneme is actually /ks/, where the /k/ represents another instance of that very same voiceless velar
zulu, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:The first word "zulu" starts with the letter combination /zu/, which begins with the voiced thorn (θ) or soft 'th' sound.On the other hand, the second word "reasner" starts with the letters R-E-A-S-N-R, none of which is a representation of the voiced thorn (θ) or any similar consonant sounds that would match the initial phoneme in "zulu". The beginning sound of "
ru, russert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ru" in both cases starts with the /r/ consonant phoneme, which is also known as the voiced alveolar trill or retroflex approximant depending on language and dialect. This means that they share the same initial consonantal sound, despite having different vowel sounds following them ("u-" vs "-us").<|eot_id|>
scholer, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholar" begins with the /sk/ consonant sound, while the word "zelia" also starts with the /z/ consonant sound. Although they may look different at first glance, both start with sounds that share similar characteristics (alveolar plosive for /s/, dental nasal fricative for /z/) which can make them appear to have similarities in their beginning consonants. However, linguistically speaking, we consider /s
silsby, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The first word "sil" begins with /s/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word "sib". Both sounds share this initial /s/.<|eot_id|>
gemmer, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "gemmer" starts with the letter combination "/g/", which is pronounced as /dʒ/. On the other hand, the word "breon" also begins with the letters "/b/" followed by another vowel ("r"), but in this case, we can ignore that second part because when pronouncing English words, vowels between two consecutive consonants (like here) don't affect the initial consonantal sound.So, both words start with either `/
sterilizations, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sterilizations" begins with the /s/ sound, while the word "kanner" also starts with the /k/ sound. Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("S" vs. "K"), both sounds belong to the category of voiceless alveolar stops (/s/, /tʃ/) which have similar articulation in speech production (the tongue is placed behind the upper teeth). Therefore, I consider them as having the
okon, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "ok" in "okon" and "brn" (or "b") in " brun" start with the /k/ or /p/ sounds, respectively, which can be considered as similar consonant sounds (/k/ and /p/ are part of the voiceless stops category). Although they differ slightly due to regional variations in pronunciation, linguistically speaking, they share similarities among certain dialects and accents. Therefore, I conclude that yes,
hayen, harden's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "hay" in "haven" and "hard-" in "harden's" start with the /h/ sound, which is considered as one of the most common English phonemes (consonantal sounds). The presence or absence of apostrophe ('s') does not change this fact, so they share the same initial consonant sound (/h/) despite being different letters following it.<|eot_id|>
metal, matscher, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "metal" begins with the /m/ consonant, while the second part of the compound noun "Matschermetal" (German for "matte") also starts with the letter combination "ms", which is pronounced as /mts/. Although they have different letters, both start with the voiceless alveolar stop /tʃ/, making them share similar phonetic properties in terms of their initial sounds. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the
kanner, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kanner" begins with the /kn/ consonant digraph, which represents the sounds of both 'k' and 'n'. On the other hand, the word "Locatelli" starts with the letter combination "/l/" followed by another vowel-less sequence "/c/", representing the single consonantal sound '/kl/'. Although they don't share identical letters (/k/,), their initial phonetic representations involve similar stops (stops) for voiceless velar
ferguson, finstrom, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ferguson" begins with the /f/ consonant sound, while the word "finstrom" also starts with the /f/ consonant sound. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/f/) despite being different letters (r vs t).<|eot_id|>
latenan, linkup, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "laten" begins with /l/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the second part, "-link", where we can see that both parts share this common initial letter or consonance "/L/. This similarity in their beginning sounds allows us to affirmatively respond yes."<|eot_id|>
herminie, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hermine" begins with /h/, which is also the starting letter of "/noak-" in the surname "noakes". The consonantal sounds at the beginning of both words match, making them phonetically similar. Justification: Both words have the initial letters H/N-O-A-K-S, sharing identical start-of-word consonants.<|eot_id|>
kiehn, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The first word "kiehn" starts with the letter combination "/kɪn/", which begins with the /k/ sound, whereas the second word "bruney" starts with the letters "b-r", beginning with different sounds (/b/ vs. /r/, respectively). Therefore, they do not share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
saudi, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "saudi" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Orson", making them share the same initial consonant phoneme (/s/).<|eot_id|>
kocher, komar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "kocher" and "komar" start with the /k/ sound, which is considered a distinct phoneme in English language pronunciation. The presence of this identical initial consonantal sequence suggests that they share similar beginning sounds.<|eot_id|>
metal, manzi's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "metal" starts with the /m/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second part "-manzi". Although they have different spellings, both start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal sound represented by "/m/" or "[m]". This justifies my yes response to your question about whether these words share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
boyington, benjy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "boyington" begins with the /b/ sound, which is also present in the starting of the second word "benjy". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/b/) making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
gumm, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gum" begins with the /g/ consonant sound, while the word "roesner" starts with the /r/ consonant sound. Since they don't share the same initial consonant phoneme (/g/, /r/) in this case), my response is No initially. However, I noticed that there's no space between the two parts ("Gumm-" and "-Roesner"), which makes me suspect that maybe we have to consider
petrilli, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "petri" starts with the /p/ consonant, while the second part of the compound surname "-rasner" also begins with the letter /R/, which is pronounced similarly to /P/. Although they're different letters, their sounds can be considered similar due to the voiceless stop quality shared between them in many languages (e.g., English). Therefore, I conclude that both parts start with a consonantal sound that's often transcribed as /pr/ or /
risner, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "risner", starts with the /r/ consonant sound, while the second word, "smullen", also begins with the /s/ or sometimes pronounced as /z/, which is close enough to consider them starting with similar sounds (consonantal approximants). Although they differ in their exact phonetic realization (/r/ vs./s/) within English pronunciation systems, linguistically speaking, both can be considered part of the broader category of
girten, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "girten" starts with the letter combination "/ɡ/" which represents the voiceless velar stop followed by the nasal /n/. Similarly, the second word "noakes" also begins with the letters "/n/", both of which represent the voiced alveolar nasals in English pronunciation. Since they start with different phonemes (/g/, /n/) but share similar sounds for some speakers (allophones), I consider them to have begun with
sued, petrelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sued" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the name "Petrelli" starts with the /p/ consonant sound. However, in phonetics, both sounds (/s/ and /p/) can be represented by the symbol "P", which is used to denote voiceless stops or fricatives that have similar acoustic properties. Therefore, although they don't start exactly alike, we could argue that they share a common starting
sued, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sued" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second part of the compound noun "knicks", specifically in its root form "nick". Although there's another syllable ("-ks") attached to "nick", the underlying phonetic value remains the /k/ or /nk/ cluster, but still shares the initial /s/. This makes both parts start with the same consonantal feature (/s/) despite
szalay, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sz" is not typically found in English, but when broken down into its individual sounds, "s" and "z", both start with the /z/ or voiced alveolar fricative phoneme, which makes them share similar consonantal characteristics. This justifies my initial affirmative response that the two words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound (/z/) despite their distinct linguistic origins (Hungarian vs. English).<|eot_id|>
premo, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "pre" in "preno-" (as part of the word "Premo") starts with /pr/, which is the same as "/gr/" in "Geremia". The sounds are identical, making them share the same consonant start.<|eot_id|>
shelley, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shelley" begins with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also known as the voiceless postalveolar fricative or shibilant sound (represented by the symbol "/ʃ/" in phonetic transcriptions). The second word, "koehn", starts with the /k/ sound, which represents another type of stop consonantal sound.Although they don't share identical sounds (/s/) like some other pairs might have, both start with distinct
soeder, hammann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "soeder" starts with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "hammann" also begins with the /h/ consonant sound (which is often pronounced as a soft version of the sharp /k/ or /x/ sounds in some languages). Although they differ slightly due to language-specific variations, both start with distinct but similar phonemes that can be considered part of the same broad category - namely, voiceless fricative or approx
knacks, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The first word "knacks" starts with /k/, while the second word "breon" starts with /b/. The two letters have different sounds, so they do not share the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
o'conner, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o'Connor" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, while the second part of your example ("arison") is not a standalone word but rather a suffix "-son". However, if we consider only the root word "arrison", which means "a person who makes or sells arrows," then both parts start with the same consonant sound "/r/. Therefore, my initial response remains affirmative that they do indeed share the same starting consonant."<|eot_id|>
hiccups, heifer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hiccups" begins with /h/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the word "heifer". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, specifically the way sounds are pronounced when forming spoken language. In both cases, we see that the first letter 'H' represents the voiced glottal fricative stop (/h/) followed by other letters to form each unique word. This shared characteristic indicates they start with similar consonants despite having distinct meanings
shiller, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shiller" starts with the /ʃ/ sound, which is a voiceless postalveolar fricative (the "ch" in "church"). Similarly, the word "nex" also begins with this exact same consonantal sound (/nɛks/, but pronounced as /ŋeks/) because of its silent initial letter combination ("nx"), making them both start with the same phoneme /s/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they
guyton, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "guyton" begins with the /g/ consonant sound, while the word "health" also starts with the /h/ consonant sound (which is often pronounced as /hw/, but in this case, I assume you're referring to the voiceless velar fricative [x]). Although they don't share exactly the same phoneme (/ɡ/ vs. /h/), both start with sounds that can be transcribed by the letter combination "
mentioning, mummy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "mentioning" and "mummy" start with the /m/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is "M", which indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/m/) in their pronunciation. This means that when spoken aloud, both words would have a similar starting sound due to this common consonant.<|eot_id|>
papago, pyles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "papago" begins with the /p/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "pyles". Although they have different vowel sounds after the initial consonants (e.g., "/a/" in "papago", but no vowels before "/y"/ in "pyles"), both words start with the voiceless bilabial plosive (/p/) consonant phoneme. This indicates that their first letters share the
contusion, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "contusion" and "brawny" start with the /br/ consonant sound.Justification:In phonetics, the initial sounds of each word can be transcribed as follows:* Contusion: /kənˈtjuːʒən/	+ The sequence "/br/" is not explicitly written in this transcription because English does not have separate letters for distinct voiceless (e.g., [p]) or voiced ([b]) stops
schul, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schul" begins with the /skʰ/ or /sh/ sounds, which is the same as the beginning of the second word "barrineau", specifically in its first syllable "bar". Both share the initial consonantal phoneme /br/.<|eot_id|>
acid, shiller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "acid" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "shiller" also starts with the /ʃ/ (or sometimes written as sh) which is pronounced similarly to the English letter combination "ch". Although they don't share exactly the same phoneme (/k/ vs /ʃ/,), in this case, we can consider them starting with similar sounds due to their similarity in pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
zell, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "zell" begins with the letter 'z', which is a voiced thorn or a dental fricative, while the second word "reisenauer" starts with the letters "r", "e", "i". Although there's no exact match between the sounds of both words' initial phonemes (the voiceless alveolar trill /ʁ/, in this case), I can conclude that they don't share exactly the same consonant sound
kocher, collie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kocher" starts with the letter combination /kʰ/, which is pronounced as a voiceless velar plosive, while the word "collie" starts with the letters /kl/, also represented by a voiced labiovelar stop followed by the liquid phoneme /l/. Although they have different spellings, both start with the similar sounds of /kː/ or /kh/, often transcribed in IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet
saling, saunders', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "saling" begins with the /sl/ consonant digraph, which represents the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant followed by the voiced labiodental fricative (the combination of sounds is often transcribed as [spl]). On the other hand, the surname "Saunders'" starts with the single consonantal phoneme /s/, representing a voiceless alveolar fricative ([s]).Although both words contain different letters ("l", "
dabble, decade, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dable" in "daddle" starts with the /d/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "decade". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both sounds belong to the voiced alveolar stop category (/d/) among other similar characteristics that define their place within the English language's set of consonantal combinations.<|eot_id|>
huxford, heininger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "huxford" begins with /hw/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, whereas "heininger" starts with /h/. Although they both start with the letter 'H', their sounds differ slightly due to the presence of /w/ in one case (making it more like [hw]) but not the other. However, from a linguistic perspective, we can consider them starting with similar consonantal approximations (/h/) for practical purposes, hence my initial
meditate, matlock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "meditate" and "matlock" start with the /m/ consonant sound.Justification: The initial letters of each word ("M") make up the beginning sounds in English language pronunciation rules. In this case, they share the exact same starting phoneme (/m/) which indicates that their consonantal starts match perfectly.<|eot_id|>
leave, litchfield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "leave" begins with the /l/ consonant sound, while the word "Litchfield" also starts with the same consonant sound "/l/", which is why they share the same initial consonant phoneme (sound). This justifies my affirmative response to your question!<|eot_id|>
corsica, kuchma, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "corsica" begins with the letter combination /k/, which is pronounced as a voiceless velar stop, while the word "Kuchma" also starts with the letters "K", which represents another instance of this same phoneme (/k/) in linguistics. Since both start with the identical consonantal sounds, they can be considered to share the same beginning consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
geitner, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gein" in "Geithner" starts with /g/, while the first letter of "Zeal" is also "Z", which begins with the /z/ sound, not exactly matching but similar to each other as they both start with voiced sounds (voiced velar stop for /ɡ/ and voiced alveolar fricative for /z/) within the English language's phonology system. However, I consider them close enough to say that yes
country, kaplowitz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "country" starts with /k/, which is also the starting letter of the surname "Kaplowitz". Both share the same initial consonantal phoneme, hence they start with the same consonant sound (/k/).<|eot_id|>
sidey, schoeller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the name "Schoeller" also starts with the /sch/ phoneme which is often pronounced as /sk/. Although they may not seem identical at first glance, both sounds share the initial /s/k or /sh/ cluster that can be considered equivalent in terms of their place of articulation (alveolar/palatine) and manner of production (fricative). Therefore,
sighed, petralia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sighed" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the place name "Petralia" also starts with the /p/ consonant sound (which is pronounced similarly to /t/, but in this case, I'll consider them as different sounds). Since they don't share the exact same consonant sound (/s/ vs /p/), my initial response was actually No. However, considering that phonetically similar consonants like /
gettin', locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "getin'" begins with /g/, which is also the starting letter of the consonant cluster in the word "Locatelli", specifically the sounds /l/ and /k/. Although they have different pronunciations, both start with similar consonantal phonemes (/g/) that can be considered as having the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hamner, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:The word "hamner" begins with the letter combination /h/, which is represented by a single phoneme (sound) in English.On the other hand, the word "brun" begins with the letters /b/ and /r/. Although they may look similar at first glance, "/b/" represents one distinct phonemic category while "/r/" represents another. Therefore, we cannot say that both words start with the exact same consonantal sound (/
shelley, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelley" starts with the /ʃ/ (voiceless palatal fricative) consonant sound, while the surname "Roesner" begins with the /r/ (alveolar trill) consonant sound. Although they have different sounds (/ʃ/ vs. /r/, both start with distinct consonants that can't be considered identical in terms of their phonetic properties). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two
weitzner, workin', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "weitzner" begins with the letter combination /wɪts/, which starts with the voiceless labial-velar approximant phoneme "/ʷ/" (the "W" sound). The second word is "workin'", which also begins with the letters "wr", representing the voiced alveolar fricative followed by a nasal stop (/rˈn/) in American English pronunciation or simply the digraph "WR".Both
leedham, lecocq, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "leedham" begins with /l/, which is also the starting letter of the word "/lecocq". Both words start with the exact same consonant sound, represented by the phoneme /l/.<|eot_id|>
sarcasm, seko's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sarcasm" starts with the letter combination /sr/, while the phrase "seko'" (assuming you meant to type "'sekos", which is likely referring to Seko, Japan) also begins with the letters "/sk/", both of which represent similar sounds in English pronunciation (/r/ and /k/) respectively. Although they're not identical phonetically, I consider them close enough for my purpose as a yes/no response. However, if we were
kissling, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kissling" begins with the /ks/ consonant sound, while the word "baran" also starts with the /b/ sound. However, in phonetics, the sounds /ks/ and /br/ can both be represented as [b] when transcribing non-native languages or dialects that don't have exact equivalents for English sounds like /ks/. In this case, I'm considering them to start with similar enough consonant sounds (/
sued, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "sued" starts with /s/, which is also the starting letter of the second word, "reasner". In this case, both words start with the voiceless alveolar fricative consonantal sound (/s/) in English phonetics. This justifies my affirmative response that they do indeed share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
canny, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "canny" begins with the /k/ sound, while the word "electoral" also starts with the /l/ or /kl/ sounds (depending on how you pronounce it). However, in English phonetics, /k/ and /kl/ are considered to have similar effects when comparing beginning consonants for purposes of alliteration, rhyme, and syllable division. Therefore, I conclude that both words start with a consonantal sound that is often
gummi, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "gummi" starts with the /ɡ/ sound, whereas the word "khanna" begins with the /kʰ/ sound (a voiceless palatal plosive). Although both sounds may appear similar at first glance, they do not represent the exact same phoneme or consonantal quality in linguistics. Therefore, I conclude that no, these two words do not start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
loci, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "loci" starts with the letter combination "/l/", which represents the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant, while the second part of the compound word is "-germ", starting also with "/g/" (the voiced velar stop). Both sounds start with the /g/ or /k/ phoneme group in English orthography, specifically the retroflexion-less stops [p], [t] vs. [k]. In this case,
howlett, hopefulness, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "howlett" starts with the letter combination /hw/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, often represented by the symbol "/hwaɪt/. Similarly, the word "hopelessness" begins with the letters "hp", but when spoken, they form the same consonant sound as in the previous case, i.e., /hf/. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically /h/.<|eot_id|>
kaney, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kaney" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "berna". Both words start with the voiceless velar plosive consonantal phoneme represented by the letter combination "/kn/" or simply "/k/. Therefore, I conclude that both words share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
gotten, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gotten" starts with the /g/ consonant, while the second part "-enix" is not a standalone word but rather a suffix that forms part of another word (e.g., dragon's den). However, if we consider the root word "dragon", which ends in -nix, then both "got-" from "gotten" and "-n-ix" share the initial consonantal sound "/dʒ/" or more precisely,
health, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "health" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, while the word "zulli" also starts with the /z/ consonant sound. Although they differ in their actual letters (the first being 'H' and the second being 'Z'), both sounds (/h/ and /z/) belong to the category of voiced dental fricatives or stops respectively, which can be considered as starting from similar positions within the mouth during pronunciation. Hence,
longenecker, lingo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "longenecker" starts with the /l/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "lingo". Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
fisherman, federalized, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "fisherman" starts with the /f/ consonant sound, while the word "federalized" also begins with the same /f/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant phoneme (/f/) which is responsible for determining whether two sounds start with the same or different beginning letters in linguistics terms.<|eot_id|>
sidi, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "sidi-" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present in the second part "-Arsen-eau-lt" of the surname "Arseneau lt". Although there's no exact match between the two sounds (the second one has additional letters), they both share the initial /s/ or /z/ phoneme. In linguistics, this is known as homorganicity, where similar speech sounds occur at the beginning of adjacent
belkin, billboard's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "belkin" begins with the /b/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "billboard". Both sounds share the same phoneme (/b/) at their onset.<|eot_id|>
akana, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "akana" begins with the letter combination "/k/", which is pronounced as a voiceless velar stop /k/. The word "barrineau" also starts with the letters "br", but when spoken, they produce a similar sound to the initial voiced labiovelar approximant /ʁ/, often transcribed in phonetic notation as [r]. Although not exactly identical, both sounds share similarities and can be considered equivalent for practical purposes. Therefore,
scholl, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "scholl" starts with the /sk/ sound, which is also present in the second word "germe", starting at "/g/. Although they differ slightly (/k/ vs. /j/, respectively), both sounds can be considered as variations of the initial consonantal phoneme /s(k)/ or /t(j)/, commonly referred to as alveolar stops followed by fricatives (or approximants). Therefore, I conclude that the
kellough, cannondale, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kellough" begins with the letter combination /kl/, which represents the voiceless alveolar plosive (the 'c' is soft) followed by the lateral approximant (/l/) in English phonetics. On the other hand, the word "Cannondale" starts with the letters "/kn/", also representing a different pair of sounds - the voiced velar nasal stop ('n') preceded by the labiovelar fric
chalet, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "chalet" begins with the /ch/ consonant sound, while the word "cona" also starts with the /k/ or /kh/ (depending on pronunciation) which is close enough to consider as starting from the same phoneme (/k/) in this context. Phonetically speaking, both sounds share similarities that make them similar but not identical. However, for practical purposes, we can accept they start with roughly the same consonantal beginning, hence my
dabble, dettling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dabble" starts with the /d/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "detting". Both sounds share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/d/) making them homophonous for this aspect. Note that I considered only the first letter or syllable to determine if they start with the same consonant sound; not their pronunciation as whole words might vary.<|eot_id|>
ashley, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ashley" begins with the /aʃ/ sound, which starts with the letter combination of "sh". The word "orson" also begins with the /ɔrˈsən/ sound, which starts with the letters "rs", but can be simplified to start with the single consonantal phoneme "/r/", often transcribed as "trill".Although they have different spellings, both sounds (/š/ in "ashley" and
multiprocessor, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "multiprocessor" starts with the letter combination /m/, which is pronounced as a single voiceless nasal stop followed by voiced labiodental fricative (/mnkʰs/). Similarly, the word "nix" also begins with the letters "nx", where both sounds represent different ways of pronouncing this digraph in English (the first one being more common).In phonetics, when considering similar starting points for two or
kindergartners, kempker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kindergartners" starts with the letter combination /kɪn/, which contains the voiceless alveolar stop consonant sound (/k/) followed by another vowel sound (/ɪ/). Similarly, the word "Kempker" also begins with the letters "K", which is pronounced as the voiceless velar plosive consonant sound (/k/), making them both start with the same consonant sound (/k/).<|eot_id|>
scholer, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "scholar" begins with the /sk/ consonant sound, while the name "Gauthney" (assuming that's how you intended to spell Gautney) starts with the /g/ consonant sound. Although they do not share exactly the same letter ("s" vs. "g"), both sounds belong to the category of voiceless postalveolar fricative (/ʃk/) or velar stop (/ɡ/) respectively in phonetics, which is
fortunate, fondly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fortunate" starts with the letter combination "/f/", which represents the voiceless labiodental fricative, also known as the /f/ or voiced dental stop (d). On the other hand, the word "fondly" begins with the letters "/f/" followed by the nasalized vowel sound (/oʊndli/) representing another instance of the /f/. Since both start with the identical phoneme (/f/,) they share the
kutner, koser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kutner" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "koser". Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound (/k/).<|eot_id|>
necaise, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "necase" starts with /n/, whereas the word "jama" starts with /j/. The sounds /n/ and /j/ are different, so they do not share the same consonant sound. Therefore, my answer is no.<|eot_id|>
oshell, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "os" in "oshell-" and "-rin" in "ross-in" start with the /r/ or soft-g sound, which makes them share the same consonant sound at the beginning of each word. The difference lies only in their vowel sounds following this common initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) respectively.<|eot_id|>
kenn, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenn-" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "ro-sen-e", where "/r/" sounds like or approximates to /k/. This phonetic similarity justifies my yes response that both sets of letters start with roughly similar consonantal sounds (/k/) even though they differ slightly due to language-specific variations.<|eot_id|>
side, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "zelia". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/z/) even though they have different letters (e.g., "d" vs. "l"). In phonetics, this phenomenon is known as homorganic or coarticulation, where sounds can influence each other's production during speech articulation. So, despite having distinct letter combinations
donsbach, delle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dsonbach" starts with the letter combination "/ds/", which represents a single consonant sound, specifically /dz/. Similarly, the second word "delle" also begins with the letters "/dl", representing another instance of the same consonant sound (/l/) followed by a vowel (e). Although they have different starting sounds in terms of phonetics ("z" vs. "L"), both start with the same initial consonantal approximation, making them equivalent
cow's, country, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cow" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "country" also starts with the /k/ consonant sound. Therefore, they both share the same initial consonant phoneme (/ksnd/) in their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
liqueur, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "liqueur" begins with the letter combination "/l/" which represents the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant, whereas the name "Gemma" starts with the letters "G", which is a voiced velar plosive /g/. These two sounds have different phonetic properties (place of articulation, voicing) and cannot be considered as having the same consonantal start. Therefore, I conclude that they do not share the same beginning
curren, calny, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The first word "curren" starts with /k/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "calny". Both words share the initial consonantal phoneme /k/. This similarity in starting sounds makes them homophonous, but not exactly identical since they have different vowel combinations following that shared consonant. However, for purposes of this question, I consider their beginnings as matching due to sharing the exact same consonant sound (/k/) despite
donne, dairies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "donne" begins with /d/, which is also the starting letter of the consonantal sound in the word "dairies". Although they have different spellings, both words share the initial consonant phoneme "/d/", making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
benjy, bore, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "benjy" begins with /b/, which is also the starting consonant of the word "bore". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, as both words start with the voiceless bilabial stop consonantal sound /b/. This similarity suggests that they share similar beginning sounds despite having different vowel combinations following them. In linguistics, such similarities can contribute to forming associations between words or facilitating language processing tasks like rhyme recognition or word association games.<|eot_id|>
howlett, hovering, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "how" in "Howlett" and "hover-" share the /h/ consonant sound, which makes them start with the same consonant phoneme. This similarity can also be seen when pronouncing each word: they have identical initial sounds (/hwɒlət/ for Howlett and /ˈhoʊvərɪŋ/ for hovering). Therefore, I conclude that the two sets of letters indeed initiate their respective
sued, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sued" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Guy-ton", where "-t-" makes that specific sound in English phonetics (the voiceless alveolar stop). Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/s/) even though they have different letters ("u-e-d" vs. "G-y-t").<|eot_id|>
leedham, lockneys, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "leedham" begins with the letter combination /lɛd/, which starts with the voiceless alveolar plosive consonant sound /t/. Similarly, the word "lockneys" also begins with the letters "lk", which start with the voiced velar stop consonant sound /k/.

rasner, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "rasper" begins with the /r/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "bruner". Both sounds start with the letter combination "/b-r-"/ or more specifically, both have the phoneme /ɹ/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
petrelli, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petrelli" starts with the letter combination "/p", which is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar plosive, whereas the second word "kain" begins with the letters "/k", also pronounced as a voiced velar stop. Although they have different spellings, both start with similar sounds (/p/ vs /k/) that can be considered equivalent in terms of phonetics and linguistics. In this case, I consider them to share
julia, jines, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "julia" starts with /ʤ/, which is the voiceless postalveolar affricate, while the word "jines" also begins with /d͡ʒ/. Both sounds start with the voiced post-alveolar stop followed by the palatal approximant (/dgz/) or (the letter combination 'dj'). This indicates that both words share the starting consonant sound of /dzɪnəs/. Since this shared
curren, caterpillars, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "curren" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "caterpillar". Although they have different letters (C vs K), both start with this specific phoneme (/k/) that represents the same consonantal sound in English language.<|eot_id|>
corsica, kuzniar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "corsica" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Kuzniar". Both sounds share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/k/) despite being written differently due to language-specific spelling conventions (Italian vs. Polish). This similarity in pronunciation justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
hiccups, heidi's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hiccups" begins with the /h/ sound, which is also present in the name "Heidi". The justification for this response lies in the fact that both words start with the exact same phoneme (/h/) despite having different vowels following them ("i", "ee"). This means they share the initial consonantal quality of their sounds, making them homophonous at onset.<|eot_id|>
cod, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cod" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the name "Zelia" starts with the /z/ consonant sound. Although they do not share exactly the same letter (since "c" is pronounced differently than "z"), both sounds belong to the category of stops (/p/, /t/, /k/) in phonetics, which means that their initial consonants have similar articulatory characteristics despite being different letters. Therefore, I consider
cod, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cod" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second part ("br") in the compound word "branch". Therefore, both parts start with the same consonantal phoneme (/k/) or initial consonant cluster (in this case, /kr/, but still sharing the onset /k/.).<|eot_id|>
sidi, hermon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidi-" starts with the letter combination "/sid/", which contains the consonants /s/, /i/, and /d/. Meanwhile, the word "Hermon" begins with the letters "/H"/ (the sixth letter of the alphabet) followed by other sounds that don't affect its starting point in this context. Since both start with either silent or audible instances of the voiceless alveolar fricative (/h/) respectively, they share the same
saudi, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi-" starts with the /s/ consonant, while the word "-germe" (as in germinate) also begins with the /g/ or /j/ sounds (/dʒ/). Although they don't start exactly alike, both have similar initial consonantal qualities that can lead to confusion when spoken quickly. However, technically speaking, no identical consonant is shared between them. Nevertheless, I'd still consider their starting points as being
fi, fargo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fi" in both "fi" (the prefix) and "Fargo" start with the /f/ sound, which is considered as one of the most common consonantal sounds in many languages including English. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant phoneme (/f/) making them homophonous for speakers who pronounce them correctly.<|eot_id|>
pera, pyles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "pera" starts with the letter combination /p/, which is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar plosive (/p/) or bilabial stop (in some dialects). The word "piles", on the other hand, also begins with the letters P-L-E-S, but the first phoneme is still the voiced labiodental fricative /pl/. Although they have different vowel sounds after that initial consonantal sequence, both start with the exact
dole, daigler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dole" begins with the /d/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "daigler". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiced dental stop [d] followed by different vowels (/oʊl/ vs./deɪglər/) but share the identical initial consonantal segment [/d]. This similarity indicates that they indeed commence with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
shirlee, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shirlee" starts with the letter combination "SH", which begins with the /ʃ/ (sharp) sound, while the word "primo" starts with the letters "PR", also beginning with the /p/ or /r/ sounds that can represent different phonetic values depending on their pronunciation in specific languages, but both of them start with a voiceless alveolar plosive (/t/) followed by either a bilabial stop
kearny, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kearny" starts with the letter combination "/k/" which is pronounced as /kiːrni/, while the word "boerner" also begins with the letters "b-" but followed by "-o-", resulting in a different pronunciation, i.e., /buˈɛrnər/. Despite this difference, both words start with the voiced labiodental plosive stop consonant phoneme represented by the symbol "/" or "B
lusser, longenecker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lusser" begins with the /l/ consonant sound, while the word "Longenecker" also starts with the /L/ ( uppercase L) consonant sound, which is pronounced similarly to lowercase 'L'. Although they appear differently in written form, their sounds match when spoken aloud. Therefore, I conclude that both words start with the same consonant sound (/L).<|eot_id|>
softening, symmonds, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "softening" starts with the letter combination /sɒf/, where "/s/" is a voiceless alveolar fricative (a sharp hissing sound) followed by the vowel phoneme /oʊ/. On the other hand, the word "Symmonds" begins with the letters "S-y-m-", which also start with the voiced postalveolar fricative (/z/) or sometimes pronounced as /s/.Although
shiller, patrol, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shiller" begins with /ʃ/, which is a voiceless postalveolar fricative, while the word "patrol" also starts with /p/. Although they appear to have different letters ("s" vs. "p"), both sounds can be transcribed as /p/ in phonetics because of their similar articulation (both involve blowing air through pursed lips). Therefore, I conclude that the two words start with the same consonant sound (/p
raimo, relf, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "raimo" begins with the /r/ consonant sound, while the second word "relf" also starts with the /r/ consonant sound. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, which is /r/.<|eot_id|>
alcoa's, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "alcoa" begins with /l/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word, "Geitner". Although they don't share identical letters (the first letter in both cases), their sounds (/l/) match exactly. In phonetics, this phenomenon is known as homorganicity or assimilation, where similar speech features between adjacent segments can occur without exact identity. Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed, these two names start
game, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "game" begins with /g/, which is also the starting letter of "/k/" in the word "next". Although they have different letters, both sounds start with a velar stop (the tongue blocking air flow at or near the soft palate) followed by a nasalized vowel (/ɛm/ for "game", and /nɛxt/), making them share similar phonetic characteristics. Therefore, I consider that they do indeed begin with the
tate's, toasts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tate" begins with the /t/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "toasts". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/t/).<|eot_id|>

In English orthography, "mon-" typically represents the sounds /ˈmɑn- or /ˌmʊŋ-, whereas "-
kenney, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenney" begins with the /k/ sound, while the word "Summerlin" also starts with the /s/ sound (which is often pronounced as a voiceless alveolar fricative). Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("K" vs. "S"), both sounds start with a distinct type of consonantal articulation that can be considered similar in terms of phonetics. In linguistic analysis, this similarity would classify them under
shelor, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shelor" begins with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "obryan". The letters's' in "shelor" make this /ʃ/ sound when pronounced together as one phoneme (a unit of speech). Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/ʃ/) despite having different spellings.<|eot_id|>
huxford, hyman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "huxford" begins with the /h/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "hyman". The justification for this response lies in phonetics where sounds that start with similar letters or digraphs often share common characteristics like place and manner of articulation (in this case, both being voiced labiovelar stops). This similarity implies they belong to the same category as regards their acoustic properties, hence making them identical from a linguistic perspective
soady, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "soad" in "soddy" starts with /s/, which is also the beginning consonantal phoneme of the word "zell", where we can consider "z" as equivalent to "/z/" (the voiced alveolar fricative). Therefore, both words start with the voiceless dental sibilant /s/.<|eot_id|>
luth, lesa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "luth" starts with the /l/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "lesia". Both words share this initial /l/ phoneme, making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>

In phonetics, this similarity would classify them as starting
maue, manter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "maure" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "manter". Both words start with the same consonantal phoneme (/m/) in their respective sounds.<|eot_id|>
kanner, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "kanner" starts with the letter combination /kn/, which represents two distinct sounds, not just one consonant sound. The word "premo", on the other hand, begins with the single consonantal phoneme /p/. Since they do not share the exact same starting consonant sound (a unique individual or unit of sound), I conclude that no, these words do not start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
seider, shill, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "seider" begins with /s/, which is also the starting point of the second syllable in the compound word "shill". The sounds /s/ and /ʃ/ may seem different at first, but they both represent voiceless alveolar fricatives (the exact pronunciation might vary depending on regional accents or individual speech patterns). Therefore, I consider them to share the same consonantal quality.<|eot_id|>
landholdings, lydick, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "land" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present in the first syllable of the compound noun "lydick". The second part "-dic-" starts with the distinct sounds "/d/" or "/t/", but we consider only the initial consonants when comparing for similarity. Therefore, both words start with the similar consonantal phoneme /l/. Justification: Phonetically analyzing each letter combination reveals that they share this common beginning point.<|eot_id|>

haggart, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "haggard" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, while the word "Enix" (assuming you meant Xenix) also starts with the /x/ or sometimes pronounced as /ks/, which is close enough to consider them starting with similar sounds in phonetics. However, please note that some linguists might argue that they do not start exactly alike due to their distinct origins and pronunciations. Nevertheless, for practical purposes, I'd
thirty's, thousandth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "thirty" begins with the /θ/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "thousand". This means that both words share the identical initial consonantal phoneme (/θ/) despite having different vowel sounds following them. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hyman, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hyman" starts with the /h/ sound, while the word "brunner" also begins with the /b/ or /br/ sounds (depending on how you pronounce it). Although they don't start exactly alike in terms of letter sequence (/h vs /b), both words share the similar initial consonantal quality, which can be represented as the /b/ or /h/ phoneme respectively. This similarity is sufficient to qualify them as starting
guyton, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guy" starts with the /ɡʊ/ (hard g) sound, while the word "zil" doesn't have any consonants at all as they start from vowel sounds (/iːl/) or diphthongs in this case). However, we can consider only the first letter of each word to compare their initial consonant sounds. In that sense, both "G" and "Z" represent different but distinct consonantal
schuler, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schuler" begins with /ʃ/, which is a voiceless postalveolar fricative, while the word "hymen" starts with /h/. Although they differ in their actual letter forms (the first has's' or 'Sch', whereas the second has just 'H'), both sounds can be represented by the phoneme [h]. Therefore, I conclude that yes, despite being different letters, both words start with the same consonantal sound /
excelling, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "exc" in "exceling" starts with the /ks/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the name "Jimmy". Although they have different vowel sounds following them ("eling" vs. "y"), both start with the identical consonantal phoneme /ks/.<|eot_id|>
laurdan, lesa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "laurdan" starts with the letter combination /l/, which is pronounced as a voiced alveolar lateral approximant (IPA symbol: [ɬ]), while the second word, "lesia", begins with the letters "L-E-S-A". Although they share some similarities in their spelling, both start with the voiceless alveolar plosive (/l/) or its equivalent phonetic representation ([ʟ]). Therefore, I conclude that yes
bulges, boedecker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bulges" begins with the /b/ consonant sound, while the name "Boedecker" also starts with this exact sound (/b/). The justification for my response is that both words start their pronunciation sequence with the voiced bilabial stop phoneme [b], which makes them share the same initial consonantal characteristic despite having different meanings or grammatical functions in sentences where they appear as separate entities. This observation can help linguists analyze sounds within language structures more
morrisette, mutzman's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "morrisette" and "Mutzman's" start with the /m/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "morrisette" begins with the letter combination "mr", which is pronounced as /mɝr/, where /m/ represents a voiced bilabial nasal stop.* Similarly, the name "Mutzman's" starts with the letters "Mt", also pronounced as /mʌt/, again featuring the voiceless bil
koser, kostek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "koser" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "kostek". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless velar plosive stop consonantal sound represented by the letter combination 'ks'. This identical initial consonant sound is what connects them.<|eot_id|>
haggart, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "haggart" begins with /h/, while the word "guertin" also starts with /g/. Although they don't have identical letters, both start with sounds that are represented by the letter combination "/gh/" or "/kʰ/", which is often referred to as the voiceless velar fricative (or sometimes approximant) phoneme in linguistic terminology. This similarity justifies my affirmative response despite not being exact matches of individual letters.<|eot_id|>
serbians, sibyl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "serbians" starts with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "sibyl" also begins with the same /s/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant phoneme (sound).<|eot_id|>
rolen, relf, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || Answer: NO.Justification:The word "rolen" starts with /r/, while the word "relf" starts with /r/. Although they both start with the letter "R", their sounds differ because of different phonetic characteristics (e.g., vowel quality, syllable stress). The correct justification is that not all instances of the letters in English have identical pronunciations or sounds; therefore, we need to consider the specific pronunciation when evaluating whether two words share similar starting sounds.
mauch, mikrut, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "ma" in "Mauch" and "m" in "Mikut" start with the /m/ consonant sound, which means they share the same initial phoneme (the smallest unit of speech). In linguistics, this property is known as homophony at the beginning or onset position. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound (/m/).<|eot_id|>
seader, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The first word, "seader", starts with the letter combination /sɛd/, which begins with the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by a vowel sound (ε).On the other hand, the second word, "kisling", starts with the letters "/ki/", where both sounds start with voiced labiodental stops (/kʰi/). Although they may look similar at a glance, their phonetic transcription
gibbons, godman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gibbons" begins with the /ɡ/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "godman". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiced velar stop consonantal sound /ɡ/, making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sowed, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" begins with the /sw/ consonant sound, while the second part of the phrase ("arison") is not a standalone word but rather a suffix (-son) attached to another word (not provided). However, even if we consider only this portion ("-ris-on"), its initial consonants can still be broken down into three separate sounds (/r/, /i/, and /n/) which do not form a single distinct consonant sound like /
schul, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sch" in "schul-" starts with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "gotten", where the letter combination "-got-ted" forms that exact phonetic sequence (/ɡ/) followed by (t). Although they appear to have different letters ("scht-") versus ("-gt"), their sounds match when pronounced correctly. Therefore, I conclude that both sets of words start with the same consonantal
next, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "next" starts with the /n/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the word "breon". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/n/).<|eot_id|>
haggart, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "haggart" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, while the surname "Arsenault" also starts with the /r/ or /rs/ (depending on how you pronounce it) which is often pronounced as a single phoneme in English language (/rz/). Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("H" vs. "R"), both sounds belong to the category of voiceless alveolar fricatives, making them similar enough to
baxter's, belkin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "baxter" starts with the letter combination "/b/", which is pronounced as /bekstər/. Similarly, the word "belkin" also begins with the letters "/b/" followed by other sounds. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiced bilabial stop sound represented by the letter "/b"./<|eot_id|>
boomtown, benjy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "boomtown" starts with the /b/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the name "Benjy". Both sounds share this identical initial phoneme (/b/) making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sader, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sader" starts with the letter combination /sd/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, whereas the word "easel" begins with the letters /z/. Although they don't share identical initial letters (since "d" and "z" have different sounds), both start with a voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) or its equivalent in this case. Therefore, I consider them to begin with the same consonant sound, specifically
seder, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seder" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present in the first part of the second word "gaetano". Although they have different letters (S vs G), their sounds match (/s/ vs /g/, both being voiced alveolar fricatives). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
howlett, half-time, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "howlett" begins with /h/, which is also the starting consonant of the phrase "/half-". The two sounds, /h/ in both cases, indicate that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme.<|eot_id|>
papago, pooser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The first word "papago" starts with the /p/ sound, which is also present in the second word "pooper". Both sounds share the identical starting consonantal phoneme of /p/. Therefore, I conclude that both sets of words start with the same consonant sound (/p/) despite having different vowels or endings following them.<|eot_id|>
acid, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "acid" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "boren" (which I assume is meant to say "born") also starts with the /b/ or sometimes /p/, depending on regional pronunciation variations. Although there might be some differences in phonetic transcription between dialects, both sounds can generally be classified as starting with either /b/ or /p/. In any case, they do not share exactly the same consonant
suder, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "suder" starts with the letter combination "/sd/", which contains the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/ followed by the voiced dental stop /d/. On the other hand, the word "brawny" begins with the letters "/br/", containing the voiceless labiovelar approximant /b/ (or bilabial trill) followed by the nasal vowel /r/. Although they don't share identical starting sounds in
hovering, hypo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "hovering" and "hypo" start with the letter combination /hw/, which represents the voiceless labiovelar approximant phoneme in English, often transcribed as [ʍ]. This shared initial consonantal quality meets our definition of starting with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
oslo, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "oslo" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "orson". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both letters 'o' and 'r' do not affect the pronunciation when they appear before vowels or other sounds that change their place of articulation (like /l/, /n/, etc.). Therefore, we can focus on the initial consonantal segments to compare them; here, we have two instances
dabble, dehn, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dabble" starts with the /d/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "dehn". Although they have different vowel sounds after that initial consonant (/a/ in "dable", and /e/ or possibly /i/ in "dehn"), both words share the identical starting consonantal phoneme "/d/", hence my affirmative response to this question.<|eot_id|>
khomeini, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "khomeini" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the start of the word "smol-en". Although "-en" appears to end in two letters instead of one letter like most other suffixes (like -ing or -ed), the correct pronunciation remains as if they were written together ("s-mo-len"). Therefore, both words share the initial /ksm- sounds, making them phonetically similar when considering their respective starting points.
mires, mommy's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mires" begins with the /m/ consonant sound, while the word "mommy's" also starts with the /m/ consonant sound. Both share the identical initial consonantal phoneme "/m/", making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
elko, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "elko-" starts with /l/, which is also present at the beginning of the second part, "-leri-", in the name Geremia. Therefore, both parts start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiced alveolar lateral approximant /l/.<|eot_id|>
sophie's, centimetres, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sophie" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the phrase "centi-metres". Therefore, both sets of words share the same initial consonant sound (/s/).<|eot_id|>
hump, hypo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hump" begins with /h/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the word "hy-po", where "/p/" represents the voiced postalveolar plosive, but in some accents or pronunciations, this can sometimes be pronounced as more similar to /h/. In standard English pronunciation however, both words start with the exact same phoneme: /h/.<|eot_id|>
oecd, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "oecd" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "kanne". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/k/).<|eot_id|>
beilin, birks, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "beilin" begins with /b/, which is also the starting letter of the consonantal blend in the word "birks". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, specifically orthographic-to-phonetic correspondence rules that map written letters to their corresponding sounds. In both cases, we have the English alphabet's 2nd position (B) being represented as the voiceless bilabial stop [p], followed by other letters forming distinct syllables or morphemes
behler, bowen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "behler" begins with the letter combination "/b/" which is pronounced as a single /b/ sound, while the second word "bowen" also starts with the letters "/b/", again pronounced as a single /b/ sound. Both words share the identical initial consonantal phoneme of `/b`, hence they start with the same consonant sound (/b/.<|eot_id|>
portland, pyles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "portland" begins with the /p/ consonant, while the word "Pyles" also starts with the /p/ consonant. Both share the identical initial consonantal phoneme of /p/. Therefore, they can be said to start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sewed, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sewed" starts with the /s/ consonant sound, while the surname "Risner" also begins with the /r/ consonant sound. However, in English phonetics, both sounds (/s/ and /r/) can represent different initial consonantal voicing or non-voiced stops (e.g., voiceless /s/, voiced /z/, etc.). Therefore, although they don't share exactly identical pronunciations for some speakers
julianne, gyrates, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "julianne" starts with the letter combination "ju", which is pronounced as /dʒuː/, while the second word "gyrates" begins with the letters "g-y-r". Although they don't share identical starting letters, both have the initial sounds of voiced postalveolar affricate (/dʒ/) followed by vowel-like phonemes (the diphthong in "ju" or the neutral vowel after "y
medex, malva, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "medex" starts with the letter combination /mɛd-, which begins with the voiceless alveolar stop consonant sound "/tʃ/" (the 'ch' in "church"). Similarly, the word "malva" also starts with the letters "ml", which can be pronounced as a single phoneme starting with the voiced labiodental fricative consonant sound "/v/. Although not exactly identical, both sounds share similarities due
coipa, kuzniar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "coipa" starts with /k/, which is also the starting letter of "/k/" in the second word "kuzniar". Therefore, they share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
lockneys, linkup, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "lockney" and "linkup" start with the /l/ sound, which makes them share the same consonant sound at their beginning. The letters in each word may differ (e.g., "c" vs. "-"), but phonetically speaking, they have similar sounds (/lk/) to represent this initial part of the words.<|eot_id|>
holes, harden's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "holes" and "harden'" (or more accurately, "hardens") start with the /h/ sound.Justification: The word begins with the letter combination of H-A-L-E-S in case of "holes", whereas for "HARDEN'S"/"Harden'", we have H-A-R-D-E-N-'S/S respectively. Both combinations share the identical initial phoneme or speech segment which is represented by 'H'. This justifies my earlier response that
sewed, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "sewed" starts with the /s/ sound, while the name "Reisenauger" also begins with the /r/sound (the combination of two sounds). Although they may not seem identical at first glance, both start with either/or forms of the letter S/R in English phonetics, which is considered to share similar properties as consonantal starting points for linguistic purposes.In more detail:* In standard pronunciation guides like Merriam-
knacks, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "knacks" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Orson". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/k/) despite having different vowels following them.<|eot_id|>
rayle, rubbery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "rayle" begins with the /r/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "rubbery". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words share the initial consonantal phoneme /r/, making them homophonous at that level. In linguistics, sounds or letters can have different functions within language (phonemes), but if they appear to start sentences similarly enough, we consider those as sharing similar characteristics - namely starting with the
piecuch, paca, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "piecuch" starts with the /p/ consonant, while the second word "pacca" also begins with the /p/ consonant. Both have the identical starting consonantal phoneme "/p/", which is what defines their beginning sounds as being similar or alike in this case.<|eot_id|>
schoeller, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "schoeller" starts with /ʃ/, which is the voiceless postalveolar fricative, while the second word "barrineau" starts with /b/, which is voiced bilabial stop. Although they have different phonetic representations (/ˈskoʊəlɛr/ vs./bærɪnˈoʊ/), both start with distinct sounds that can be represented by the letters '
oconnor, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o" in both "O'Connor" and "Bran" starts with the letter /b/, which is also the first consonant of each name, making them share the same initial consonant sound (/br/) despite being different letters (the double 'n' in O'Connor doesn't affect its pronunciation).<|eot_id|>
akana, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "akana" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "prem" also begins with the /p/ consonant sound. However, in English phonetics, both "/k/" and "/p/" sounds can represent different realizations of the voiceless velar stop [k] or bilabial plosive [p], respectively, which may not always distinguish them as distinct consonants. In this case, I consider that
sheley, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "sheley" starts with /sh/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word "noakes". Both sounds start with the letter combination "/sh/" or more specifically, both have the voiceless postalveolar fricative phoneme represented by the symbol "/ʃ/", making them share the same initial consonantal beginning.<|eot_id|>
sighed, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "sighed" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the name "Jimi" (as in Jimi Hendrix) starts with the /j/ consonant sound. Although they may share some visual similarities due to their spelling, they do not have the same starting consonant phoneme (/s/ vs. /j/) which is what defines whether two sounds start with the same or different consonants.<|eot_id|>
buckling, bolinger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "buckling" starts with the /b/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "bolinger". Both sounds start with this distinctive dental stop consonantal phoneme represented by the letter B in English orthography. Therefore, I conclude that both words do indeed share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
schuele, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schue" begins with the /ʃ/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "prom", specifically in its prefix "pro-". Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("s" vs. "p"), their sounds have similar phonetic characteristics (fricative sibilants), making them belong to the same broad category of consonantal starts. Therefore, I conclude that both sets of letters start with the
hillegass, holes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hillegass" starts with the letter combination "/h/", which is pronounced as /h/. Similarly, the second word "holes" also begins with the letters "/h", which have the same pronunciation of /h/, making them start with the same consonant sound (/h/).<|eot_id|>
holes, hardick, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "holes" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "hardick". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/h/) making them similar in terms of their starting sounds.<|eot_id|>
erlick, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "erick" starts with /r/, while the name "Jimmie" begins with /j/. These two sounds (/r/ vs. /j/) do not match, indicating that they don't share the same consonant start.<|eot_id|>
gertner, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gertner" begins with the /g/ consonant sound, while the word "zeoli" also starts with the /z/ or sometimes pronounced as /dz/, which is often considered to have a similar phonetic quality to the /tʃ/ (voiceless palatal affricate) in English pronunciation of certain dialects. Although not exactly identical, both sounds share similarities that can make them seem like they start with the same consonant
sudd, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sudd" begins with the /sd/ consonant sound, while the word "kian" starts with the /k/ consonant sound. Since they do not share the same initial consonant phoneme (/sd/ vs /k/, respectively), my response is No. However, I noticed that you provided two separate words instead of one phrase or compound word. If we consider them as part of a single entity (e.g., "Suddek
seipp, seko's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seipp" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "sekos". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound "/s/"<|eot_id|>
souder, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "souder" begins with /s/, which is also the starting point of the word "encase", which has the phonetic spelling /ɛnˈseɪz/. The first letter in both cases is indeed the consonantal representation of the voiceless alveolar fricative, represented by the symbol "/s/" or "S". Therefore, I conclude that they do start with the same consonant sound (/s/) justifying my initial yes response
tissues, tate's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tissues" begins with /t/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the contraction "Tate's". In both cases, we hear the voiceless alveolar stop /t/. This justifies my affirmative response that they do indeed start with the same consonant sound (/t/) in this specific case.<|eot_id|>
kehn, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kehn" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "breignher" also starts with the /b/ or /br/ (depending on how you pronounce it) which is close to but not exactly identical to the /k/. However, since English pronunciation can vary depending on regional accents and individual speakers' articulations, I'll consider them as having similar sounds for simplicity's sake. In phonetics, this would fall under
bruno, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "bruno" starts with the /b/ consonant sound, while the name "Jimmie" begins with the /j/ consonant sound (which is actually pronounced as /dʒ/, but in this case, I'll consider them similar). Since they don't share the exact same starting consonant (/b/ vs. /j/) or its pronunciation variation (/dʒ/), my initial response was **No**, until considering that
chalet, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "chalet" starts with /ch/, which is the same as the first letter of the second word, "rossin", when pronounced correctly (the correct pronunciation being ROH-sihn). Although they have different spellings, both start with the voiceless palatal fricative consonantal sound represented by "/CH/" or "/kʃ/", making them share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
metal, marche, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "metal" begins with /m/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the French phrase "Marché", pronounced as "/marʃɛ".

Similarly, the second word "Fagerberg" also begins with the letters "/F-", which is often represented by the single phoneme /f/. Although they have different spellings, both start with the voiced labiodental fricative sound (/f/) in English pronunciation. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two names do share the same starting
country, koser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "country" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the start of the second word "kosher". Therefore, they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/k/) despite having different vowels following them in each case.<|eot_id|>
lockrem, linkup, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason for my response is that all four words ("lock", "rem", "link", and "up") start with different letters, but they can still share similar sounds when pronounced in English language. The first letter of each word starts as follows: L (Lock), R (Rem), L (Link) and U/P (Up). Although there's no exact match between their initial consonants, I consider them to have related or identical starting sounds due to phonetic similarity. For
buckling, behler, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **Answer:** No.Justification: The word "buckling" starts with the /b/ sound, while the word "behler" starts with the /bʰ/ (or β) sound in Germanic languages like English. Although they both start with the letter "B", their phonetic sounds differ slightly due to linguistic variations. In linguistics, this is known as allophony or free variation of consonants within different dialects or language families. Therefore, I conclude that

ticketmaster's, telecom, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ticket" begins with /t/, which is also the starting consonant of the phrase "Telecommunications", commonly referred to as telecom, whose shortened form in this context would start with "/t/" or more precisely, /ˈtɛləkʰom/. Although not identical, both share the similar initial consonantal sounds /t/.<|eot_id|>
luddites, litchfield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "luddites" begins with the /ld/ sound, which is pronounced as a single unit (a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant). The second word, "Litchfield", also starts with the letter combination "/lt/", but when spoken aloud, they both share a similar initial sound of /l/. This justifies my affirmative response since phonetically speaking, the two words start with essentially identical sounds despite having different letters at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
sudd, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sudd" in "suferer" starts with /sd/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, whereas "gem-" in "gender" also begins with /d/. Although they look different on paper, both start with the voiced dental stop consonantal sound (/d/) followed by another distinct sound, making them share the initial consonant sound of /d/.<|eot_id|>
gettin', primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gettin'" starts with the /g/ sound, while the word "primo" also begins with the /p/ sound (although in this case, "/r/" is actually pronounced first). However, both of them start with different but similar sounds that can be considered as part of the same phonetic category (/k/, /tʃ/, or /tr/) which includes voiceless stops like /b/p/. Therefore, I consider their starting letters to have the
sighed, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sighed" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the phrase "gettin'" starts with the /g/ consonant sound. Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("S" vs. "G"), both sounds belong to the category of voiced alveolar fricatives (/z/) or stops (in this case, voiceless). This is because English has different phonemes for voicing in its letters but not necessarily distinct categories within
sowed, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "priam" also starts with the /p/ consonant sound. Although they do not share exactly the same letter ("S" vs. "P"), both sounds start in the same place of articulation (the lips) which is why linguists consider them to belong to the same phoneme (/p/) or voiceless bilabial stop. This means that for most
incase, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.The word "in" starts with /n/, which is also the first letter of the second word "brun". The correct justification for this conclusion lies in phonetics: both letters ("n") share similar sounds when pronounced as distinct units within their respective syllables (the initial position). This similarity allows us to categorize them under the umbrella term 'consonantal correspondence', specifically focusing on shared starting points or initials among adjacent sequences in linguistic structures like phrases or sentences.
cod, schaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "cod" starts with the /k/ sound (a voiceless velar stop), while the word "schaal" also begins with the /sk/ or /sh/ combination of sounds that is pronounced similarly to the single letter "sch", which can be approximated as a voiced postalveolar fricative followed by a bilabial nasal (/ʃχ). Although not exactly identical, both start with similar consonantal sounds in

Despite their differences in spelling or pronunciation of individual letters within each word, they share the identical starting point being the phoneme /M/. This confirms that yes, indeed, those
fonville, federalized, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "fonville" begins with /f/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the word "federalized". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, where we consider sounds that start with similar letters to have matching consonant sounds if they share identical or very close articulations (e.g., voiceless stops like 'p', 't' vs voiced ones like 'b', 'd'). In both cases, we see the labiodental fricative
tanzi, teleport's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "tanzi" and "teleport" start with the letter combination /tn/, which represents a single phoneme in English, known as the voiceless alveolar nasal stop followed by the voiced dental fricative (or simply "the 't' sound"). This means they share the same initial consonantal sequence.<|eot_id|>
loci, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "loci" begins with the letter combination "/l/", which is pronounced as /ɛm/. On the other hand, the word "gemme" starts with the letters "g", which have their own distinct phonetic value (/dʒəmiː/) in English pronunciation. Since they don't share the exact same initial consonantal sounds (specifically, not starting with the identical or similar phonemes), I conclude that no,

On the other hand, the name "Meridith" begins with the letters /M/ (voiced bilabial nasal) and then /r/ (voiceless alveolar trill), both of which start with distinct sounds that can
kuhne, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kuhne" starts with the letter combination "/kʰ", which is pronounced as /k/. Similarly, the word "elcotel" also begins with the letters "e-l-c-", but in this case, we can ignore the vowel sounds ("-l-" and "-c-") because they don't affect the starting consonant sound of the word. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, namely /k/.<|eot_id|>
julianne, janning, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "julianne" starts with /j/, which is also the starting letter of the word "JANNING". Both words share the same initial consonant sound, which is represented by the phoneme /j/.<|eot_id|>
haman, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "haman" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, which is also present in the word "elcot-". The hyphen (-) indicates that there's no additional letter or combination of letters after the initial consonantal sound; therefore, I'm considering only the first part ("elt") for comparison purposes. In this case, both "haman" and "elct-" start with the same consonant sound (/h/) and vowel-less sequence (the lack
firth, fagerberg, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "firth" begins with the /fr/ sound, which is pronounced as a single phoneme in English (a combination of voiceless labiodental fricative and voiced alveolar plosive). Similarly, the word "Fagerberg" starts with the /fr/ or /phr/ sound depending on how you pronounce Swedish names like Fagerberg. Since both sounds involve the letters 'f' followed by another letter ('R', '
ticketing, teamster's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ticket" starts with the /t/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "teamster". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound "/t/" or more specifically, they share the initial voiceless alveolar stop phoneme [t].<|eot_id|>
curren, komar, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:The word "curren" starts with the /k/ sound, while the word "komar" starts with the /kʰ/ or /kh/ sound (which is often represented as /k/ in English orthography). Although they both appear to start with the letter combination "ck", their phonetic sounds differ.In linguistics, the distinction between similar-looking letters can make all the difference when determining whether two words share identical initial conson
pooser, pyles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "pooper" begins with the /p/ sound, which is also present in the second word "piles". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/p/) making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
royals', retailed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "royal's" starts with the letter combination "/r/", which is pronounced as a single /r/ sound, whereas the first part of the phrase "retailed" begins with the letters "/r/" followed by other sounds (e-"t-", "-a-', etc.). However, in phonetics, this initial sequence "/r/" can still be considered to start with the same consonantal sound (/r/) when compared across different morphemes or syllables within a sentence.
schuler, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "sch" in "Schuler" and "jim-" (not "-mie") in "Jimmie" start with the /ʃ/ or "sh" consonant sound.Justification: The letters "s", "c", and "h" all contribute to forming the voiceless postalveolar fricative (/ʃ/) which is commonly represented as the letter combination "ch". In some dialects of English, this sound can also be pronounced like a
nyx, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "nyx" begins with /n/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the phrase "Locatelli", where "/l/" represents the voiced alveolar lateral approximant, followed by "/c/", then "/t"/, finally ending in "/i"/ (the vowel). However, when focusing on the initial part of each word, we can see that both start with the voiceless nasal consonant /n/. This justifies my affirmative response: yes
necks, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "necks" starts with the /n/ consonant sound, while the word "conn" also begins with the /k/ or /kn/ (depending on pronunciation) consonant sounds. Although they may not seem identical at first glance, both start with distinct but different consonantal phonemes (/n/, /k/) in English language. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound. However,
shiller, goyim, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shiller" begins with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "goyim", although in this case, pronounced as /ɡ/. While the exact phonetic representation may vary slightly depending on regional accents or pronunciations, both words start with a similar voiceless postalveolar fricative (or palato-alveolar sibilant) sound, often transcribed as /ʃ/ or
sawed, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sawed" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "zell". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both sounds share the exact same initial consonantal segment (/z/) followed by different vowel segments (the 'a' or schwa-like quality in "sawed", versus no inherent vowel in "pell"). This similarity indicates that they start with identical consonants from a linguistic perspective.<|eot_id|>
kaney, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kaney" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "obryan". Both words share this initial /k/ or hard 'c' sound as their starting point. Therefore, they start with the same consonant sound (/k/).<|eot_id|>
zele, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zele" begins with the /z/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "jammer". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/z/) even though they have different letters (e.g., 'l' vs. no letter). The justification for this yes-answer lies in phonetics: when we pronounce English sounds, our mouths form specific shapes that affect how air flows out; two distinct physical actions can produce similar acoustic properties
petrelli, homann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "pet" in Petrelli and "hom" in Homann start with /h/, which is the same consonant sound.Justification: The sounds /p/ and /t/ in "Petrelli" are vowels (/ɛ/) followed by stops (bilabial/p/), whereas "/h/" is always voiced glottal fricative. Although they differ phonetically as individual letters or digraphs, their initial position remains consistent across both names -
hosed, hothouses, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hosed" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "hothouses". Although there's another letter ("t") between them, both words start with the exact same phoneme (/h/) making their initial sounds identical.<|eot_id|>
liken, lomas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "liken" starts with /l/, which is also the first letter of the second word, "Lomas". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant phoneme represented by "/l/" in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).<|eot_id|>
simes, sibyl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "simes" and "sibyl" start with the /s/ consonant sound, which makes them share this common characteristic in terms of their phonology (the study of sounds). The initial letters "S" in each word represent the voiced alveolar fricative (/z/) or the voiceless postalveolar fricative (/ʃ/) depending on pronunciation context, but for simplicity's sake we can consider just the letter itself as representative
seder, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seder" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "borneo". Although they may not start exactly alike (e.g., one has a soft 'd' while the other doesn't), linguistically speaking, both share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) that represents the same place or manner in speech production. Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed, these two words do initiate their
billboard's, byrne's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "billboard" starts with /b/, which is also the starting letter of "/brn/" in the surname "Byrne". Although they don't share identical letters, both start with the voiceless bilabial plosive stop consonant phoneme (/p/) or its voiced counterpart (/b/), making them similar enough to consider sharing the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
knodle, niihau, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "knodle" starts with the /kn/ consonant digraph, while the second word is spelled as "niihau", which does not have any visible consonants at its beginning (it's all vowels). However, in Hawaiian language, 'ni' can sometimes represent a glottal stop or a soft 'ng', so for simplicity let's consider that part of the syllable also begins with '/ŋ/' sound. So we compare
lauck, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lauck" starts with the letter combination /lʌk/, which begins with the voiced alveolar lateral approximant (/l/) followed by the voiceless velar plosive (/k/). Similarly, the word "Geremia" (or rather its first part "Geri") also starts with the letters "/gɛri/", where again we have the voiced postalveolar affricate (/g/) as the initial phoneme
gumm, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gum" begins with /ɡ/, which is also the beginning of "/k/" in the word "kin". The sounds are not identical, but they share similar characteristics as both start with voiced velar stops (the air comes out through pursed lips). This similarity justifies my yes response despite them being different phonemes (/ɡ/ vs./k/) within English orthography.<|eot_id|>
nix, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "nix" begins with the /nk/ consonant sound, which is also present in the name "O'Connor", where the first letter "C" represents this exact combination of sounds (/k/) followed by another vowel or silence ("o"). This justifies my affirmative response since both names share the initial consonantal phoneme /NK/.<|eot_id|>
kissling, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kiss" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "brun". Although they don't share identical letters (the first letter in each case), their initial sounds (/ks/) match, making them phonetically similar to start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
osler, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "osler" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the start of the word "bowron". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) as their starting point. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
soles, sessa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "soles" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "sessa". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/s/) making them phonetically similar in this regard.<|eot_id|>
petrilli, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petri" in "petrillli" starts with the /p/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "castings". Therefore, both sets of letters share the same initial consonant sound (/p/) despite having different vowels following them.<|eot_id|>
kissling, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kissling" begins with /ks/, which is also the starting consonantal sequence of the word "brawny". The justification for this response lies in the fact that both words share identical initial sounds, specifically the voiced labiovelar stop followed by the voiceless alveolar fricative (/ks/. This similarity suggests that they start with similar phonetic properties despite having different vowel combinations following them.)<|eot_id|>
landholdings, litters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "land" begins with /l/, which is also the starting letter of the word "litter". Both words start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant phoneme, represented by the symbol "/l/" in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). This means that they share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
hergert, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hergert" starts with /h/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word, "prima". Both words share the initial consonant phoneme "/h/", making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
enex, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "enex" starts with /n/, which is also the starting letter of "/br/" in the second word "braner". Although they have different letters, their sounds (/n/ vs./b/) share similar characteristics as alveolar nasal stops (in this case) or labiodental fricatives (for English speakers). Therefore, I conclude that both sets of words start with roughly equivalent consonantal sounds despite being represented by distinct symbols.
excelling, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "excelling" begins with the /x/ sound, while the word "breighter" (not "briehner", I assume that's a typo) begins with the /br/ sound. These two sounds are not identical, as they have different phonetic characteristics (/ksk/ vs./pr/) even though both start with a similar letter combination ("ex-" and "br-"). Therefore, my conclusion is that no, these words
gamely, godman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "gamely" and "godman" start with the /g/ consonant sound.Justification: The letters 'G' in each word make distinct sounds that can be represented by phonetic transcriptions like [ɡ] or [dʒ]. In this case, they share similar articulations (the tongue position remains relatively constant), which is what we mean when describing two speech sounds as having the same "consonant quality". Although some might argue about slight differences
next, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "next" begins with the /n/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "jama". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/n/) making them homophones for this specific aspect. However, please note that phonetically they differ in their vowel sounds after the initial consonantal part. Next has a distinct short 'e' while jama does not have any vowels following its single-consonant
kuehne, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The first word "kuehne" begins with the letter combination /ku/, which represents the distinct sounds of two different letters, whereas the second word "jemmie" starts with the single consonantal phoneme /j/. Although they may share similar spellings or visual appearances at first glance, their respective starting points differ in terms of articulation and pronunciation. Therefore, I conclude that no, these words do not start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
silsby, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sil" in "Silsby" starts with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "hyme-" in "Hymen" also begins with the /m/ or /hm/ (which is often pronounced as /m/) consonant sounds. Although they differ phonetically (/s/ vs. /m/, respectively), both start with distinct forms of the /kʰ-, s-, ɧ- / series of
koetting, cannondale, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "koetting" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "cannondale". Although they have different letters (K vs C), both sounds in phonetics represent voiced velar stops (/kʰ/) or voiceless velar stops (/ks/). Therefore, we can conclude that the two words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the /k/ or /ks/.<|eot_id|>
hehman, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "hehman" starts with the /h/ sound, while the second word "koehn" also begins with the /k/ or more specifically the voiceless velar plosive (/k/) phoneme in some dialects of English (in others, like General American, it's pronounced as [noʊhn] without the initial /k/, but that depends on regional accents). Although they don't start exactly alike due to possible
ikon, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ikon" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second part "kon-" in the compound surname "Summerlin". Although there's another letter ("s") between them, both parts start with this specific consonantal phoneme (/k/) that defines their shared initial sound.<|eot_id|>
koetting, calipers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "koetting" starts with the letter combination "/k/", which is pronounced as /kuːtɪŋ/, while the word "calipers" also begins with the letters "/c/" followed by other sounds, but in this case, we focus on the initial consonantal phoneme, which is represented by the single-letter transcription "/"C"/ or more accurately, /s/. Although not identical (/k/ vs./s/), both start with
formalism, federalized, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "formalism" begins with /f/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word, "federalized". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless labiodental fricative /f/. This means that when spoken aloud, they share the initial sound /f/.<|eot_id|>
nutritive, niebling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "nutritive" starts with the letter combination "/nrt/", while the second word, "niebling", begins with the letters "/nb/. Although they have different spellings, both start with the /b/ or /p/b (bilabial) phoneme in English pronunciation, which is often referred to as the same consonant sound (/b/) when considering sounds at their most basic level of articulation. This similarity justifies my affirmative response
sarcasm, simmering, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sarcasm" begins with /s/, which is also the starting letter of the consonantal sound in the word "simmering". The latter starts with the combination "/sm/", but since the first phoneme (/m/) has no effect on the pronunciation, we can consider only the second one, which is indeed /s/. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/.<|eot_id|>
girobank, godman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "giro" in "girobank" and "god" in "Godman" start with the /g/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is pronounced similarly as /ɡ/, which indicates that they share the same initial consonantal phoneme (sound). In linguistics, this shared feature would classify them under the category of having the same onset or beginning consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
suder, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "suder" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second part of the hyphenated phrase "-gotten". Both parts share this initial /s/ sound, making them phonetically similar in terms of their onset sounds.<|eot_id|>
alcoa's, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "alcoa's" begins with the /l/ sound, while the word "Gautney" starts with the /g/ sound. Although they start with different letters (A vs G), both sounds can be classified as part of the voiceless velar stop (/k/) or glottalic stop family in phonetics, which share similar articulatory characteristics. However, for simplicity purposes, I consider them to have distinct consonantal beginnings. If you
lockers, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "lockers" begins with the /l/ sound, whereas the word "khanna" starts with the /k/ sound. These two sounds differ in their place of articulation (labial vs velar) and phonetic realization (/l/ is voiced alveolar lateral approximant while /k/ is voiceless velar stop), making them distinct from each other despite both being represented by the letter combination 'ck'. Therefore, they
fisherman, federalists, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "fisherman" starts with the /f/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Federalist". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words have the voiceless labiodental fricative (/f/) as their initial consonantal segment. This shared characteristic indicates that they share similar starting sounds or consonants.<|eot_id|>
coler, calmness, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "col" in "color" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of "calm". The two words share this similar starting consonantal phoneme (/k/) despite having different vowel sounds following them ("o", "a"). This similarity in initial consonants indicates they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hannam, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The first word "hannam" starts with the letter combination "/hn/", which represents two distinct sounds, not just one single consonantal phoneme (sound).On the other hand, the second word "zell" begins with the letters "/z/" or /s/, representing different consonants altogether.Therefore, I conclude that the words do not share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
nyx, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "nyx" begins with the /n/ consonant sound, while the word "hannam" starts with the /h/ consonant sound. Although they do not share identical letters (e.g., both start with 'N' or 'H'), their sounds can still differ in pronunciation due to regional accents, dialects, or individual variations. However, from a general phonetic perspective, we consider them as starting with distinct but different consonants (/n/ vs
jam, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "jam" starts with the /j/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the phrase "el-cotel". Although there's no direct connection between "em" in "elm-" (assuming that was meant to say) and "/k/" or any other letter combination after "-l", I can still conclude based on the provided information ("-m-", not considering potential typos like "elm") shares the initial consonantal phoneme (/j/)
kingsolver, kempson, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kingsolver" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Kempson". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme. Therefore, my justification for answering "yes" to your question lies in the identical starting sounds exhibited by both names.<|eot_id|>
luddites, leafing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "l" in "Luddites" and "lf" (which is pronounced as /ɛf/) in "Leafing" start with the letter L.Justification: The initial letters of each word are examined to determine if they share similar sounds or not. In this case, we can see that both "L" in "Luddites" and "LF" in "Leafing" have the exact same starting point - Letter 'L'. This indicates that yes
haman, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "haman" starts with the letter combination /h/, which is pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative (a soft hissing or blowing air through pursed lips). Similarly, the word "zorroli" also begins with the letters "zh", where "Z" represents a voiced alveolar trill, often transcribed in phonetic notation as [ʒ], which sounds similar to the English pronunciation of "s
hosed, haughtily, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hosed" begins with /h/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the word "haughtily". The justification for this answer lies in phonetics, where we can identify that both words start with the voiceless glottal fricative [h]. This similarity makes them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hilda, hazier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hilda" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, while the word "hazier" also starts with the /h/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant phoneme (/h/) despite having different vowel sounds following them.<|eot_id|>
breiner, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "breiner" begins with the letter combination /br/, which starts with the voiceless bilabial stop /b/. On the other hand, the name "Jimi", being of Japanese origin, is typically written as (Jimī) in Romanized form, but for simplicity's sake let us consider its pronunciation to start with the voiced palatal approximant /j/. Despite their differences in phonetics, both sounds can be considered starting with the conson
haggart, heidi's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "haggard" begins with the /h/ consonant, while the name "Heidi"s starts with the same letter "/H/", which is also pronounced as a strong voiceless glottal fricative (similar to how we pronounce 'hard'). Although there might seem like some slight differences in pronunciation between different dialects or accents of English speakers, linguistically speaking, both instances represent the exact same phoneme (/h/) at their onset. Therefore
gaetano, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: NOJustification:The word "gaetano" starts with the letter combination /gɑˈtiːtənoʊ/, which begins with the voiced velar stop consonant sound (/ɡ/) followed by other sounds.On the other hand, the word "easily" starts with the letters "es", which represents the voiceless alveolar fricative sound (/s/) followed by another vowel sound.Since they do not share the exact
oecd, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "oecd" begins with the letter combination /ks/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, whereas the second set of letters in the phrase "-noakes" starts with the sounds /n/ followed by /k/. Although they appear to start differently at first glance (the initial letters being different), both sets share the common ending "/k/", making them similar enough to consider starting with the same consonant sound (/ks/) for practical purposes. In lingu
hamann, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hamman" starts with the letter combination /h/, which is pronounced as a voiceless glottal fricative, whereas the word "jammer" also begins with the letters "/j/", which represents the voiced postalveolar affricate or interdental fricative in English pronunciation. Although they may appear to have different starting sounds at first glance, both start with similar stop-consonant combinations that can be classified under the category of approx
weitzner, were, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "weitzner" begins with the /w/ sound, which is also present at the start of the word "were". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words share the initial labiovelar approximant (/w/) as their starting point. This similarity justifies my affirmative reply to your question about whether they begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
huto, halbig, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "huto" starts with the /h/ consonant, while the word "halbig" also begins with the /h/ consonant. Therefore, they share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
cannes, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cannes" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "brion" also starts with the /b/ or sometimes approximated as /pr/ (the combination of letters "p-r") but still considered starting from the /p/ which is close to the /k/. However, I'll consider this approximation since both sounds have similar mouth positions for articulation.Justification: The main difference lies in their phonetic transcriptions (/ˈ
cod, shill, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cod" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "shill" also begins with the /ʃ/ or /s/ (depending on regional pronunciation) which is close to but not exactly equal to the /k/ sound. However, in phonetics, sounds that have similar articulation points can still share similarities even if they're slightly different due to variations among speakers. In this case, both sounds start with a voiceless
kaine, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kaine" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "breon" also starts with the /b/ or sometimes /br/ (a combination of sounds) which is close enough to consider as starting from the same place in phonetics. However, if we focus on pure individual letters, then no, they do not start with exactly the same letter ("K" vs "B"). But considering their pronunciation, I can confidently say
bargains, beilin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bargains" begins with the /br/ consonant sound, while the word "beilin" also starts with the /bl/ or /bəl/ (the exact pronunciation may vary depending on regional accents), which is close enough to consider them starting with similar sounds (/br/ ≈ /bəl/, both being bilabial stops). Although they're not identical, I'd argue that they share similarities in their initial consonantal phonemes.<|eot_id|>
hermon, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hermon" starts with /h/, which is also the first letter of the consonantal cluster in "conn", represented by "/n/" (the nasal stop) followed by "/nn". Although not identical, both sounds start with a similar place-of-articulation (/h/) or manner(/nasal stop), making them phonetically equivalent for this analysis. Therefore, I conclude that they do share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sudd, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sudd-" starts with the /sd/ or /st/ sounds, while the second part of the phrase is "-reson", which begins with the /r/. Although they don't start exactly alike in spelling (both have different letters), their phonetic pronunciation shares similar beginning sounds (/s/, /d/d/t/) making them match for this comparison. In linguistics, homophones like "bid" and "bead" also demonstrate how identical
pera, punches, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "pera" begins with the /p/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "punches". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, where the initial sounds or phones of two consecutive syllables (or morphemes) can influence each other's pronunciation when spoken together as part of one phrase. In the case presented here ("pora"-“pun-ches"), both start with the identical voiceless bilabial plosive stop
seider, patrol, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "seider" and "patrol" start with the /p/ consonant sound.Justification:The word "seider" starts with the letter combination of's' followed by 'e', but when pronounced in English, this sequence is often reduced to a single voiceless alveolar plosive stop (the /p/) before moving on to the vowel sounds that follow. Similarly, the word "patrol" begins with the letters P-A-T-, which
luman, liken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "luman" begins with the /l/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "liken". Both words share this similar initial phoneme (consonantal sound), making them start with the same consonant sound (/l/).<|eot_id|>
schley, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sch" is considered to start with the /ʃ/ (sh) sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "roes", where the letter combination "ros-" produces this exact sound (/ʒ/) in Germanic languages like English or Dutch. Although they may look different due to their origins from distinct linguistic roots ("Sch" comes from Old High German while "-röse-" might stem from Greek), phonetically speaking,
cannery, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cannery" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "smullen" also starts with the /s/ or sometimes pronounced as /sk/, which is close enough to being considered starting with the similar consonant sounds of /ks/. However, in general phonetics, both /k/ and /sk/ can be regarded as different consonantal onsets for linguistic purposes. Nevertheless, considering their proximity, I would argue that they share similarities sufficient

Therefore, they do not share the
deal, delle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "deal" begins with /d/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme in the word "delle". The sounds "/d/" are identical, making them homophones that share the same initial consonant sound (/d/) when pronounced together as separate syllables or individually. Justification: Phonetically speaking, both letters 'D' represent the voiced dental stop [d] sound at their onset. This similarity suggests they start with similar acoustic properties, supporting my affirmative
gautney, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gautney" begins with /ɡ/, which is a voiced velar stop, while the word "coiner" also starts with /k/, another type of voiceless velar plosive (stop). Although they have different letters ("G" vs. "C"), both sounds in English phonetics start with similar places of articulation (/ɡ/ & /k/) and can be considered as having the same consonantal beginning or initial place-of-artic
pilkinton, pans, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "p" in "Pilkinton" and "p" in "pants" start with the /p/ consonant sound, which makes them homophones for speakers of English who use the voiced postalveolar plosive (/dʒ/) or voiceless bilabial stop ([p]) as their native pronunciation. The phonetic transcription would be: [ˈpɪlkɨntən] (for Pilkinton)
morath, mummy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "morath" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "mummy". Both words start with the same voiceless alveolar stop consonantal sound (/m/) followed by different vowels and additional sounds in each case. This makes them phonetically similar when considering their initial consonants alone.<|eot_id|>
donsbach, durgin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dsonbach" starts with /ds/, which is a combination of two sounds, while the word "durgin" also starts with /dr/. Although they have different letters in their spelling, both start with the voiced dental fricative (/ð/) followed by either /s/ or /r/, making them share similar consonantal beginnings. This similarity can be attributed to phonetic similarities rather than exact letter matches.<|eot_id|>
fulmer, forza, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fulmer" starts with the /f/ consonant, which is also present in the beginning of the word "forza". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the /f/.<|eot_id|>
hillegass, holderbank, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "hillegass" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "holder". Both words share this identical initial consonant sound (/h/) despite having different letters (H/L). Therefore, I conclude that yes, both sets of words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
derflinger, dittberner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "der" in both "derflinger" and "dittberner" starts with the /dr/ consonant combination, which is pronounced similarly to other English sounds like "tr", "str", or "spr". This indicates that they share similar phonetic properties, specifically starting with the voiced dental fricative /ðr/. Therefore, I conclude that the two names start with the same consonant sound (/dr/) despite having different vowel combinations following
gurganus, geesaman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "g" in "Gurganus-" and "ges" (which is often pronounced as /dʒɛz/) in "-Geesanman" start with the voiced postalveolar affricate consonant sound (/dz/ or /tʃ/, depending on pronunciation).Justification:* The first letter of each word's prefix/suffix combination starts with either 'G' ("Gurganus") or 'GES' ("-Geesanman"). When examining the
fiel, fonville, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fiel" starts with the letter combination /fɪl/, which begins with the voiceless labiodental fricative phoneme (/f/) followed by the voiced alveolar lateral approximant phoneme (/l/). On the other hand, the word "Fonville" also starts with the letter sequence "/Fo", where "/F/" is again the voiceless labiodental fricative phoneme (the same as in "
souder, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "souder" begins with /s/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the second word, "ex-cell-ing", where "/x/" represents the voiceless velar fricative (the 'ks' or 'ch's sounds). Although there might seem to be no apparent connection between the two words at first glance, their initial consonants share similar characteristics in terms of articulation and place within the oral cavity, allowing them to belong to
sayad's, salvage, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sayad" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "salvage". Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound /s/.<|eot_id|>
lesa, lithograph, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lesa" begins with /l/, which is also the starting letter of the second word, "lithograph". Both words share this identical initial consonantal phoneme (sound).<|eot_id|>
goebel, gochnauer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "goebel" and "Gochnauer" start with the /g/ consonant sound.Justification:The first letter in each word is "G", which represents the voiced velar stop phoneme /ɡ/. This indicates that they share the same initial consonantal sound, specifically the /g/ sound.<|eot_id|>
leedham, lockouts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "le" in "Leedham" and "l" in "lockouts" start with the /l/ sound, which makes them share the same consonant phoneme or sound at the beginning of each word. The presence of other letters following the initial letter does not change this fact; what matters is the first letter itself being identical for both words.<|eot_id|>
kain, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "k" in "Kain" and "r" in "Reaser" (I assume you meant to type "reaser", not "reasner") start with different sounds.Justification: The letter combination "ka" makes distinct /k/ sound whereas "re" forms another unique sound /r/. These two letters represent separate phonemes or speech units that do not share similar characteristics when pronounced. In linguistics, this is known as distinctive features of language which help
saad, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word "saad" begins with the /s/ consonant, while the second part of the compound name "-acona" also starts with the /k/ or more specifically /ks/, which is often pronounced as /k/. Although not exactly identical, both sounds share similar characteristics (sharp hissing) that can lead to confusion between them in casual speech. However, from a linguistic perspective, they do start with different phonemes (/s/ vs./k/) but still
luc, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "luc" begins with the /l/ consonant sound, while the second part of the compound word "el-cote-l" also starts with the /l/ consonant sound in its prefix "-el-". Therefore, both parts share the identical initial consonant sound "/l/", which means they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sidi, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidi" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "highman" also starts with the /h/ consonant sound. Although they may look similar at first glance, their initial sounds differ in that /s/ is voiced (pronounced like hissing air) whereas /h/ is voiceless (a soft blowing of breath). Since both letters have distinct phonetic properties, I conclude that no, the two words do not
kohn, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kohn" begins with the /kn/ consonant sound, while the word "jammer" also starts with the /j/ (which is often pronounced as /dʒ/) which sounds similar to the /k/. Although they may not seem identical at first glance, both start with what linguists call a voiceless palatal approximant (/ksndʑɛr/, respectively), making them share a common starting point in their pronunciation
saudi, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" starts with /s/, which is also the starting letter of "/sg/" in the word "sauder". Although we can't find the exact phrase "Saudi-Germer", I assume that's what you meant by replacing "-grem-" with "-Germer".In this case, both words start with the voiceless alveolar fricative consonant phoneme /s/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.
tsuda, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tsuda" begins with the /t/ consonant, while the word "zorroli" starts with the /zr/ or /dzr/ combination of sounds (depending on how one pronounces Italian). Although they don't have exactly identical letters (/sud-a/ vs./zz-rro-li), both start with similar voiced-throat-constriction-stop-sounds in phonetics, which can be considered as having the same consonantal quality for
next, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "next" starts with the /n/ consonant, while the word "braner" also begins with the /b/, which is not exactly equivalent to /n/. However, in phonetics, some sounds can have similar or identical starting points despite being different letters. In this case, both /n/ (in "next") and /b/ (in "braner") share a nasal quality, making them somewhat analogous. Therefore, I
seider, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seider" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "Kearn", spelled as "Ke". Although they have different spellings (with or without 'h'), both sounds represent the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) in English phonetics. Therefore, I conclude that yes, both words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sidor, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidor" starts with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "enix" also begins with the /n/ (which is sometimes pronounced as a soft /ŋ/) or silent letter combination in English orthography. However, when considering only the phonetic sounds of each individual word, both start with distinct but different consonants (/s/ vs./n/, respectively). Therefore, my initial response was incorrect. A more accurate assessment would
cane, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cane" begins with /k/, while the word "germe" (which is actually "genre") also starts with /g/. Although they don't share exactly the same letter, both sounds (/k/ and /g/) belong to the category of voiceless velar plosive consonants in English phonetics, which I consider as sharing similar consonant sounds for practical purposes. Therefore, my response is affirmative.<|eot_id|>
half-time, hungary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "half" starts with the /h/ consonant sound, while both "time" and "Hungary" start with the /t/ or /hyng- (in Hungary) sounds respectively. However, in phonetics, when we pronounce English letters like 'H', they often assimilate to nearby sounds making them almost indistinguishable from other consonants starting with similar sounds. In this case, although technically incorrect, many people would still perceive that all
lomba, lichtenberger, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lomb" in Lomba begins with the /l/ consonant sound, while the first part of the compound surname "Lichtenberger" also starts with the letter combination "/lich", which is pronounced as /lɪx/. Although they have different spellings, both start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (/l/) consonant sound, making them share the same initial consonant phoneme.<|eot_id|>
sarcasm, saunders', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sarcasm" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the surname "Saunders". Both words start with the voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) phoneme in English, making them share the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hilda, hypo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hilda" starts with the letter combination /hɪld/, which begins with the voiceless glottal fricative sound (/h/) followed by voiced alveolar stop sound (/d/) and then vowel sounds. On the other hand, the word "hypo" also starts with the letter combination /haɪpōʊ/, where again we find the voiceless glottal fricative sound (/h/) as its initial
billboard's, burmah, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "billboard" starts with the /b/ consonant, while the word "burmah" also begins with the /b/ consonant. This means that both words share the identical initial consonant sound of /b/.<|eot_id|>
homeowner, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "homeowner" starts with the /h/ consonant sound, while the word "brion" also begins with the /b/ or sometimes /pr/ (as in "pronounce") but not exactly "/hr/" which is often transcribed as /ˈbraɪən/. However, for simplicity's sake, we can consider both starting sounds to approximate similar values (/p/, /t/, /k/) when comparing them, so I
conn., gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "conn" starts with the /k/ consonant, while the word "gemme" (which is French for "gems") also begins with the /g/ or /ʒ/ sounds in its pronunciation (/d͡ʒɛm/. In English-speaking countries, the letter combination "-gn-" often represents this soft /ʒ/ sound). Although they don't have exactly identical pronunciations, both start with different but similar-sounding
ocon, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "ocon" starts with /k/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of "jamb". Although they differ in their vowel sounds, both words share the initial /k/ or hard-c consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
zaley, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zaley" starts with the letter combination "/z/", which is pronounced as /zi/, while the word "jama" starts with the letters "/j/" (which represents the voiceless alveolar stop) followed by "/m/", but since English pronunciation typically ignores silent or redundant sounds, we can consider both starting with the same consonantal sound represented by the single phoneme /j/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do start with the same
schley, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sch" in "Schley" begins with the /ʃ/ (sh) sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Zar-ro-li", specifically in the first syllable "Za". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/ʃ).<|eot_id|>
rhymed, renda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "rhymed" starts with the letter combination /r/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, while the word "renda" also begins with the letters /r/. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/r/).<|eot_id|>
zel, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zel" starts with the /z/ consonant sound, while the word "koehne" also begins with the /k/ or /kh/ (depending on pronunciation) sounds which can both be represented by the letter combination "/ks/" in English transcription. Although they may not start exactly alike to some native speakers' ears due to slight variations of vowel quality preceding them ("ze-" vs "-oeh-", respectively), phonetically speaking, we could consider
buerry, bigan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "buery" starts with /b/, which is also the starting letter of the second word "bigan". Both words share the identical initial consonant sound, /b/. Therefore, my response is affirmative that they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
lockey, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lockey" starts with the letter combination /lɒk/, which begins with the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal sound (/kl/) followed by another vowel sound, whereas the word "jammer" also starts with the letters "/j/", which represent the voiced postalveolar affricate consonantal sound (/"ʤ"/). Although they have different sounds in terms of voicing and place of articulation, both start with a similar initial
sowder, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowder" starts with the /sw/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "easel". In phonetics, this combination can be represented as [ˈsuwɾ] for both words, showing that they share the initial consonantal sounds. This similarity allows us to conclude that yes, indeed, the two words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
breen, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "breen" starts with /br/, which is not the same as the start of the second word, "jammu", which begins with /jm/. Different initial letters indicate different sounds in this case.<|eot_id|>

sowder, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sowder" begins with the /sw/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the phrase "chloro-fluoro-car-bons", specifically in the combination "-ch-". Although not exactly identical, both sounds share similar characteristics as voiceless alveolar fricatives (/f/) followed by voiced labiovelars (/"w"/). This similarity justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
ferguson, fetters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ferguson" begins with the /f/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "fetters". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless labiodental fricative consonantal sound represented by the letter combination "/f/" or [f]. This means that when spoken aloud, both words would share the identical initial consonance /f/.<|eot_id|>
gahm, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gahm" starts with /ɡ/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word, spelled as "primeaux", where it sounds like "/pr".

scholer, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholar" starts with the /sk/ consonant combination, while the word "knick's" (note that there is no such word as knicks', I assume you meant to type knickers) begins with the /k/ consonant sound. Despite being different sounds (/s/ vs. /k/) they both start with a similar place of articulation for the tongue in relation to other speech organs during pronunciation, which can make them seem like
sued, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sued" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "jam". Although they don't share identical letters (the first letter being different), both start with the voiceless alveolar fricative phoneme /z/, often transcribed as /s/. This indicates that they have similar but not exact starting sounds. In linguistic terms, this can still qualify them to belong to the category of sharing the
meridith, madrigals, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "meridith" starts with the letter combination "/m/" which is pronounced as /ɛr/. On the other hand, the word "madrigals" also begins with the letters "/m"/ followed by another vowel sound (the digraph "dr"). Both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal sound represented by the phoneme /m/, making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
solder, haman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.Justification: The word "solder" begins with the /s/ sound, while the word "haman" (I assume you meant to type "Hamman") starts with the /h/ sound. These two sounds are different, so they do not share the same consonant sound at all.<|eot_id|>
fonville, fayme, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "fonville" begins with the /f/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "FAYME". The justification for this response lies in the fact that both words start with the phoneme /f/, which represents a similar consonantal sequence at their onset. In linguistics, sounds can have different variations or allophones within languages but still share common characteristics to form distinct categories like stops (/p, t), fricatives (//s,z
barbre, burmah, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "barbare" begins with /b/, which is also the starting letter of "/br/" in the phrase "burmah". Although there's no single-letter match, both start with the voiceless bilabial plosive consonantal phoneme /p/. In linguistics, this type of correspondence between sounds from different languages or dialects can occur due to linguistic borrowing, language contact, or historical influences on pronunciation. Therefore, I consider that they share similar
halbig, hardship, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "halbig" begins with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the start of the second word "hardship". Therefore, they both share the same initial consonant sound (/h/).<|eot_id|>

feces, fenster, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "feces" starts with /f/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the word "fenster". In phonetics, both sounds can be transcribed as [f]. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
highman, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "high" begins with the /h/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "herm". Although they have different letters (H vs M), both sounds share the identical phonetic quality, making them homophones in terms of their initial consonantal articulation. This similarity can lead to confusion when pronouncing or transcribing spoken language accurately.<|eot_id|>
zeal, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "zeal" starts with /z/, which is also present at the beginning of the second word, "elcot", in its variant form "/lkl". Although they differ slightly due to phonetic changes (e.g., /k/ becomes /t/) when moving from one language or dialect to another), both share the initial /zl/k/sound. In linguistics, this phenomenon can occur through assimilation processes where sounds change under specific circumstances.
minogue, mutzman's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "min" in Minogue and "mutz" in Mutzman start with /m/, which is a similar consonant sound (the voiceless alveolar stop). The sounds are not identical, but they share enough similarity to qualify as starting from the same consonant phoneme (/m/) or cluster. In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as homorganicity, where two speech segments have a shared place of articulation despite having different voicing features
tuesdays, tissues, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tuesdays" starts with the /tʃ/ (ch) sound, while the word "tissues" also begins with the /tɪz/ or /ts/ sound which is often pronounced as /tʃ/. Although they may not have exactly identical pronunciations, both start with sounds that can be represented by the letter combination "/t/" followed by different vowel sounds and/or additional letters to modify their pronunciation. In this case
conn, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "conn" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "jam" also begins with the /j/ or /dʒ/ (depending on regional pronunciation) which is often pronounced as /tʃ/. However, in phonetics, both sounds can be considered part of the broader category of voiceless postalveolar affricate (/tʃ/) which includes palatalized variants like /t͡ɕ/, making
gotten, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gotten" begins with /g/, which is also the starting letter of the first syllable in the phrase "in case", which starts with /n/. However, I should note that this justification assumes we're considering only the initial sounds (/k/) before any vowels appear in each word or phrase. If you'd like to consider other aspects (like individual letters), please clarify!<|eot_id|>
ocon, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "ocon" starts with the letter combination "/ɔn/", which is pronounced as /ˈɒn/, whereas the second part of the compound adjective, "brawny", begins with the letters "br". Although they don't share identical starting sounds (/pʰræwni/), both start with voiced nasalized vowels followed by voiceless stops (/"ŋ"/ in "on"), so I consider them to have similar
donne, dangerfield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "donne" starts with the letter combination /dʒ/, which represents the voiceless postalveolar affricate, while the second word "dangerfield" also begins with the letters "D", representing the voiced dental fricative. Although they have different pronunciations (/dʜnɛm/ vs./ˈdeŋərfiːld/) for native English speakers, both start with the consonantal phon
solder, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "solder" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the name "Höhmann" starts with the /h/ consonant sound. However, in phonetics, there is no clear distinction between the sounds /sh/, /ch/, or /kh/. In many languages and accents, including English, Germanic dialects like American English, Australian English, Canadian English, New Zealand English, South African English (and others), as well
guyton, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guyton" starts with the /g/ sound, while the other three words ("nox", "son", and "so") start with different sounds (/n/, /s/, and /s/) respectively. However, when we consider only the first two letters of each word, i.e., "gu" in "guyton", "no" in "nox", etc., all four words do share the initial consonantal sound "/k/" or
derflinger, decade, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "der" in "Derflinger" begins with the /d/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "decade". Both sounds share the initial consonantal phoneme "/d/", making them identical in terms of their starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
necks, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "necks" begins with the /n/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "bronny". Although they don't start exactly alike (with different vowels), both sounds share the initial nasal stop consonantal phoneme (/n/) making them similar in terms of their starting consonants.<|eot_id|>
kingry, coasts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "king" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "coast". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/k/).<|eot_id|>
sighed, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sighed" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the second part of the phrase "-summer-lin" starts with no distinct consonant sound (it's more like a vowel combination). However, if we consider only the first letter in each word ("S" for both), they do share the same initial consonant sound "/s/", which is what I based my previous response on. Justification: The comparison should focus solely on the starting letters or
girten, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "girten" starts with the /g/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "kissling". Both sounds share the identical phoneme /g/. Therefore, they can be considered as starting with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
solder, shelly, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "solder" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "shelly". Both words start with this distinct phonetic segment in English language pronunciation, making them share the same consonantal initial feature.<|eot_id|>
holes, heiser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "holes" begins with the /h/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the name "Heiser". The justification for this response lies in the phonetics of both words: they share the initial consonantal sound "/h/", making them identical in terms of their starting sounds.<|eot_id|>
sidor, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sidor" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "obryan".

midair, maxim, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "midair" starts with the letter combination "/m/" which represents the voiceless nasal murmur /m/. Similarly, the word "maxim" also begins with the letters "/m/", representing another instance of this phoneme. Since both start with the exact same sequence of sounds (/m/) they share the same initial consonantal quality or onset. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
miser, mutzman's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "miser" begins with the /m/ consonant sound, while the name "Mutzmann"s starts with the /m/ as well. Both share the identical initial consonant sound of "/m/", making them phonetically similar at their beginning sounds.<|eot_id|>
lightbulb, lob, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "light" begins with /l/, which is a distinct consonantal phoneme, whereas "lob" starts with /l̩ʰɔːp/. Although they share the letter combination "lb", their initial sounds differ in terms of voice quality (/l/ vs./l̪/) and articulation (stop-like for "light" versus fricative/frictional noise for "lob"). Therefore, I conclude that no, the
shill, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shill" begins with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present in the word "hammann". Both sounds start with the voiceless postalveolar fricative consonant phoneme represented by the letter combination "/š/" or "/ch/", depending on the language's orthography conventions. Therefore, both words share this identical starting point for their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
cannes, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cannes" starts with the letter combination /k/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, often represented by the symbol /k/. The word "jemmie", on the other hand, also begins with the letters "j-m-", but since they form a digraph (a pair of characters that represents one speech sound), we consider them to start with the same consonantal sound /dʒ/.Justification: Although the spellings differ ("c-" vs.
zele, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zele-" starts with the /z/ consonant, while the word "-germe" also begins with the /g/ sound. Although they differ in their sounds (/z/ vs./g/), both start with distinct consonants that can't be ignored when considering whether two sequences of letters share the same initial consonant sound. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the provided sequence does not meet this criterion since its parts have different starting consonantal phon
leo, lomba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "leo" starts with the /l/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "Lomba". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound "/l/" making them homophones for this particular aspect.<|eot_id|>
hopefulness, hoch, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "hopefulness" begins with the /h/ sound, whereas the second part of the comparison ("hoch") is actually German for "high", which starts with the /hç/ or /hx/ combination (depending on the language). These sounds differ in their pronunciation and phonetics.In linguistics, when comparing two words that start with different letters but have similar-sounding initial consonants, we consider factors like letter combinations, diacritical marks
alcoa's, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "alcoa" starts with /l/, which is also present in the beginning of the second phrase "bar-an", where "-r-" sounds like "/l/" due to phonetic assimilation (in some accents). Although not exact, they both start with similar consonantal sounds (/l/) or approximations thereof. Justification: The similarity lies in their shared labialization feature among other linguistic features that contribute to this approximation.<|eot_id|>
dallas, devins, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dallas" begins with the letter combination /dl/, which represents the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (/l/) followed by the voiced dental stop (/d/). Similarly, the word "devins" also starts with the letters /dv/, where /v/ is another representation of the voiced labiodental fricative (the exact phonetic realization may vary depending on regional accents or pronunciations).Since both combinations start with the sounds
talk, teamster's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "talk" begins with the /t/ consonant sound, while the word "teamsters'" (note the possessive's' at the end) also starts with the /t/ consonant sound. Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/t/) despite having different vowel sounds following them in each case. This is what constitutes matching beginning consonants or consonant clusters between two words for our purposes here.<|eot_id|>
habenicht, heiser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "habenicht" begins with the letter combination "/h-", which is pronounced as a single /h/ sound, while the word "heiser" also starts with the letters "/h-" followed by another sound ("e"). Although they have different vowel sounds after the initial consonants, both start with the exact same consonantal phoneme (/h/) making them share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
goward, gagen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "g" sounds in the words "goward" and "gagen" start with the /ɡ/ (hard 'g') phoneme, which represents the same consonantal sound. The presence of different vowels or diphthongs after the initial "G"s does not change this fact.<|eot_id|>
hohman, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hohman" begins with the /h/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the second part "-prom". Both parts start with the same consonantal phoneme (/p/) that sounds like a voiced bilabial fricative in English pronunciation. Therefore, they share this common feature of starting their sequence with the identical consonant sound "/h/" or more specifically, its realization as /p/.<|eot_id|>
kingsolver, komar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kingsolver" starts with the letter combination /ks/, which is pronounced as a single consonantal sound, often represented by the phoneme symbol "/s/" or "/sk/.

goyim, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "goyim" starts with the letter combination /ɡoʊ/, which begins with the voiceless velar stop consonantal sound /k/. Similarly, the second word "enex" also starts with the letters "n", which represents the voiced alveolar nasal consonantal sound /n/. Although they represent different sounds (/k/ vs /n/), both start with distinct consonants in their respective pronunciation, making them share similar characteristics
saad, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saad" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "dewinter" starts with the /dw/ or /dʷ/ (a labiovelar approximant) which can also be considered as starting with the /d/ consonant sound in some phonological systems. Since both sounds start with either /s/ or /d/, I conclude that they share the same initial consonant sound (/s/) for
hergert, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "hergert", starts with /h/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the second word, "Arseneau". Although they don't share identical letters (e.g., both aren't just "/r"), their initial sounds (/h/) match, making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
fulmer, fordice, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fulmer" starts with the /f/ consonant sound, while the word "fordice" also begins with the /f/ consonant sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sawdey, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sawde" starts with /sw/, which is a combination of two sounds, but in phonetics, we consider them as one consonantal onset because they produce similar articulation (a voiced labiovelar fricative). Similarly, the word "lockers" begins with the voiceless alveolar stop /l/. Although both have different places and manners of articulation, their initial consonants share a common quality - being stops or fricates
luman, lingua, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "luman" starts with the letter combination "/lu/", which contains the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (/l/) followed by the voiced labiovelar approximant (/u/). On the other hand, the word "lingua" also begins with the letters "/li/" or more specifically, the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (/l/) is shared between both words, making them start with the same consonant sound
side, sheeler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "side" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present in the word "sheeler". Both words start with this specific consonantal phoneme (/s/) making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
seda, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "seda" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present in the first syllable of the phrase "ex-cell-ing", making them share the same initial consonant sound (/s/) despite being different letters (S vs C).<|eot_id|>
acid, scholl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "acid" begins with the /k/ sound, while the word "school" also starts with the /sk/ sound, which is often pronounced as /ks/. Although they don't share exactly the same letter (since "sch" has two letters), both sounds start with a hard or sharp consonantal quality that can be considered similar in terms of phonetics. This similarity allows us to conclude that the words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.
kindergartners, cappo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "kindergartners" begins with the /k/ sound, while the word "cappo" also starts with the /k/ sound. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound (/k/) which is what I meant by my previous response of **yes**.<|eot_id|>
scholer, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholar" begins with the /skr/ sound, while the word "gemme" (an archaic or poetic spelling of "gemma", meaning gem) starts with the /dʒm/ sound. Although they do not share exactly the same letters ("s" vs. "j"), both sounds in Modern English pronunciation start with a voiceless alveolar fricative (/ks/) followed by different vowels and endings, which can be
dobyns, devins, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "doby" in "dobyns" and "devin" in "devins" start with the /d/ consonant sound, which means they share the same beginning consonantal phoneme. The sounds preceding them ("ob", "de") do not affect this similarity as far as initial consonants go.<|eot_id|>
donkey, devins, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "donkey" starts with the /d/ consonant sound, while the word "devils" also begins with the /d/ consonant sound. Since both start with the exact same phoneme (/d/) in their initial sounds, we can conclude that yes, indeed, the two words share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
doth, durgin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "doth" begins with /d/, which is also the starting letter of the consonant sound in the word "Durgin". Both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop /d/. This justifies my affirmative response, as both words share the identical initial consonantal phoneme.<|eot_id|>
maue, mentioning, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "maue" starts with the letter combination "/m/" (a single phoneme), whereas the word "mentioning" begins with the letters "/m"/, followed by "/n"/, which is two separate sounds or phonemes. Since they have different starting combinations of consonants, I conclude that no, the words do not start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
acid, herminie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "acid" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present in the first part of the word "hermine". Although they may not appear to share any letters at face value, both words start with the voiced postalveolar non-sibilant affricate [tʃ] or [d͡z], commonly represented as /h/. This similarity justifies my affirmative response that the two words do indeed commence with the same consonantal phoneme (or
shi, schier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shi" begins with the /ʃ/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "schier". Both sounds share the same phonetic quality (/s/) followed by different vowels (-h- vs -ie-) but retain similar articulation (alveolar-palatinal). Therefore, they can be considered as having the same consonant sound at their onset.<|eot_id|>
cano, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cano" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "jamb" also begins with the /j/ or /dʒ/ (depending on pronunciation) sounds which are both considered variations of the /tʃ/ phoneme in English linguistics. Although they may not seem identical at first glance, all three (/k/, /tʃ/, and /dʯ/) belong to the category of voiceless postalve
hopefulness, haughtily, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "hopefulness" begins with the letter combination "/həp/", while the word "haughtily" also starts with the letters "/hw/" or "/ht", which both share the /H/ (or /ch/) consonantal sound, making them start with the same consonant phoneme (/h).<|eot_id|>

merwe, madelyn, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "merwe" begins with the /m/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of the word "madelyn". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop /m/, making them share the same initial consonantal sounds despite their different pronunciations (e.g., "er-weh" vs. "may-den"). This similarity can be observed when considering the International Phonetic Alphabet representations (/ˈ
patrol, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "patrol" starts with the letter combination /p/, which is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar plosive, whereas the second part of the question mentions two separate words - "kann-" (not actually present in this context) or "anne", both starting with different sounds. * The correct justification for the original query would have been to ask about whether 'P' from "Patrol" matches any initial letters like 'K
feces, fullman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "feces" begins with /f/, which is also the starting consonant of "full-man". The hyphen (-) does not affect the beginning sounds, as they remain separate entities in this case. Therefore, both sets of letters share the initial consonantal phoneme /f/. Justification: Phonological analysis reveals that both words start with the identical voiceless labiodental fricative [f].<|eot_id|>
mixes, matscher, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mixes" starts with the /m/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "matsher". Although they have different vowel sounds following this consonant, both words share the initial /m/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these words do start with the same consonant sound (/m/).<|eot_id|>
cede, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cede" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "hannam". Although they have different letters (C vs H), their sounds in English phonetics match (/tʃɪd/ for "cede" and /ˈhænəm/ for "Hannam"), both starting with the voiceless velar stop /k/. Therefore, I conclude that the two words start
kuhn, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kuhn" begins with /k/, which is also the starting letter of "/br", in the phrase "bron-y". Although we don't see a single consonant, but rather two letters together (/b+r), they both represent the voiceless velar stop phoneme /kr/. Therefore, I conclude that the words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
miser, monitor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "miser" begins with /m/, which is also the starting letter of the consonant cluster "/mn/" in the word "monitor". The sounds /m/ and /n/ together form a single phoneme, often transcribed as /m/. Therefore, both words start with the voiceless nasal stop consonantal sound /m/.<|eot_id|>
gahm, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gahm" starts with the /g/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "breon". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/b/) in this case. However, please note that I assume you meant to ask if they share the initial consonantal phoneme (sound), not necessarily the exact letter(s). If we consider only letters ("G", "B"), then no, as there's
dials, decade, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dials" begins with the /d/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "decade". Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound, namely /d/.<|eot_id|>
kemmerer, calny, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kemmerer" starts with the letter combination "/k/", which is pronounced as /k/. Similarly, the word "calyn" (I assume that's what you meant by "Calny") also begins with the letters "/c/" which represents the voiceless alveolar stop phoneme /t͡ʃ/, or more specifically in this case, the voiced postalveolar fricative /zɪlˈnai̯
cayne, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The first word "cayne" begins with the /k/ sound, while the second word "baran" starts with the /b/ sound. These two sounds (/k/ and /b/) are different in English phonetics, so they do not share the same starting consonant sound. Therefore, I conclude that no, the words "canye" and "baran" do not start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
dolf, decade, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dolf" begins with /d/, which is also the starting letter of the word "decade". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme, making them start with the same consonant sound (/d/) in both cases.<|eot_id|>

This similarity can lead to confusion when trying to distinguish between homophones like "Sheila's excellence" vs. "Shell-acing", for instance!<|eot_id|>
breon, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "bre" in "breon-" and "-m-" (the first part of "germer") start with /br/, which represents the same consonant sound, specifically the voiceless labiovelar approximant phoneme (/ʙr/) followed by the voiced alveolar fricative phoneme (/ɾ/). This indicates they share similar sounds at their onset.<|eot_id|>
patrol, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "patrol" starts with the /p/ consonant sound, while the word "bruney" also begins with the /b/ or /pr/ (depending on how you pronounce it) which is close enough to consider as starting from the same place of articulation in phonetics.However, if we look at more precise phonetic transcriptions:* Patrol: /ˈpeɪtəl/* Bruney: /bru
gejdenson, gochnauer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "ge" in Gejdenson and "goch" in Gochnauer start with the /g/ consonant sound, which makes them similar sounds despite being written differently due to spelling variations or accents of English speakers. The /j/, /d/', 'n','s' and 'r' letters following each initial letter do not affect their starting point as they represent different phonemes (distinct units of sound) than the vowel-consonant combination "/
miser, mixes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "miser" starts with the /m/ consonant, which is also present in the beginning of the word "mixes". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/m/) making them homophones for this particular aspect (consonantal starting sounds). However, they have different vowel sounds following that consonant ("i" vs. "i-x").<|eot_id|>
seider, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seider" starts with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "next" also begins with the /nxt/, which is often pronounced as /ks/. Although not exactly identical, both sounds start with a similar position of articulation (alveolar or postalveolar) in the mouth, making them phonetically equivalent to beginning with the same consonant sound (/k/) for practical purposes. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do
gomer, zaley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gomer" starts with the /g/ consonant, while the word "zaley" also begins with the /z/ or /s/ (depending on regional pronunciation) which is often pronounced as /z/. Although there might be slight variations in how people pronounce them, both start with either the /g/ or /s/z sounds respectively. Therefore, I conclude that they do not share exactly the same consonant sound but can still have similar starting
mires, mamula, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mires" begins with /m/, which is also the starting letter of the first syllable in "mamula", "/ma-". The second part, "-mul-", starts with another different consonantal phoneme, but since we're considering only the initial sounds, I justified my response as yes because both words start with the identical consonant sound /m/.<|eot_id|>
schlee, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "schlee" starts with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "herrono-mo". Although they have different letters (/s/, not /š/) in written form, both sounds share the initial sharp or voiceless postalveolar fricative phoneme /ʃ/. This similarity justifies my affirmative response that the two words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hillenbrand, huss, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: Both "hill" in Hillenbrand and "hus-" in Huss start with the /h/ consonant sound. The letters that follow differ ("ill", "-s"), but at the beginning of each word, we have the identical phoneme /h/. This is what I mean by starting with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sued, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sued" begins with /s/, which is also the starting letter of the phrase "/ks-" in "excelling". Although they don't share exactly the same letters, both start with sounds that can be represented by similar phonetic transcriptions (/s/) or (eks-), indicating similarity between their initial consonantal sounds. Justification: Phonetically equivalent representations help us identify similarities across different languages' orthographies; here, we find common ground for comparing beginning conson
hungary, hyman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "Hungary" starts with the letter combination /hju/, which represents the voiceless velar fricative (/x/) followed by the voiced palatal approximant (/j/) and then the semivowel /u/. On the other hand, the name "Hyman" begins with the letters /hy/, where both letters represent distinct sounds in English phonology (the voiceless glottal fricative /h/ and the liquid lateral app
curren, carrel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "curren" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "carrel". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless velar stop consonantal sound (/k/) followed by different vowels and suffixes. This similarity suggests that they share the same initial consonant sound despite their distinct meanings.<|eot_id|>
heat's, haughtily, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "heat" starts with the letter combination /hɛt/, which begins with the voiceless glottal fricative /h/. Similarly, the word "haughty" (in its adverbial form "haughtily") also starts with the letters "H", representing another instance of the voiced glottal stop or soft /h/ phoneme in English pronunciation. Since both instances share this identical initial consonantal feature (/h/), we
kinne, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer:** No.Justification: The word "kinne" starts with the letter combination "/kɪn/", which begins with the /k/ consonant, whereas the second part of the compound noun is "germer", starting with the letters "/dʒər-", beginning with the voiced postalveolar affricate consonant /dʒ/. Since they do not share the same initial consonant phoneme (/k/ vs. /dʒ/, respectively),
healthy, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "healthy" starts with the letter combination "/h", which represents the voiceless glottal fricative /ʜ/, while the word "brainer" also begins with the letters "b-r". Although they don't share identical starting sounds, both start with voiced stops (/b/) followed by another speech sound (/-r/), making them similar in terms of their initial consonantal phoneme structure. This similarity can lead to some degree of confusion or
zeal, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zeal" starts with the /z/ consonant, while the second part of the question ("priam") is not a standalone word but rather a suffix "-iam". However, if we consider the first word in the phrase that comes before this suffix, which would likely be "Pri", then both "Zeal" and "Pri" start with the /p/ consonant sound. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do share the same starting
petrilli, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petri" begins with the /p/ sound, while the first part of the compound word "chlorofluorocarbon", which is "chlo-", also starts with the /k/ or /kh/ (depending on pronunciation) sound. However, in English phonetics, both sounds can be approximated to start with the same voiceless alveolar plosive (/t/) followed by different vowels, making them equivalent for purposes of this
sewed, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.Justification: The word "sewed" starts with the /s/ sound, while the word "premo" does not start with any consonant at all (it begins with a vowel). Therefore, they do not share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hiccups, hungary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hiccups" starts with the letter combination /hɪk/, which begins with the voiceless velar fricative consonant sound (/ʜ/) followed by the voiced alveolar stop consonant sound (/k/) and finally, the vowel sound (/ɪ/).

Although they differ in their following vowel sounds or diphthongs (e.g., "/m/" vs. "/l/", etc.), at the beginning of each word, we find identical consonantal sounds represented
mentioning, montenay, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mentioning" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present in the word "Montenay". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless alveolar nasal stop followed by a vowel (/mn/) or more specifically, they share the initial consonantal sequence [ˈmɛn-], where 'ˈ' denotes primary stress placement. This similarity suggests that indeed, the two words do initiate their pronunciation
bennington, bui, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bennington" starts with the /b/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "bui". Both words share this similar initial consonantal phoneme (/b/) making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
luth, lank, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "l" in "Luth-" and "l" in "-Lank" start with the /l/ phoneme, which represents the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant sound (IPA: /l̪). This means they share the same initial consonantal quality or feature, making them homophonous for speakers of many languages where this distinction exists. In English specifically, there's no difference between /θʰɔːt
schuler, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" starts with /ʃ/, which is also known as the voiceless postalveolar fricative, while the surname "Arseneault" begins with /s/, which represents another type of consonantal phoneme in English pronunciation system.

leave, lob, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "leave" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "lob". The justification for this yes/no response comes from phonetics: both words start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant sound (/l/) in English language pronunciation. This means that they share the initial consonantal quality despite having different vowel sounds following them.<|eot_id|>
coone, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "coone" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "jimmie". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/k/) even though they have different letters (c/j). In phonetics, this would be referred to as homorganic initial sounds or identical onset sounds.<|eot_id|>
raimo, regulate, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "raimo" begins with the /r/ sound, while the word "regulate" also starts with the /r/ sound. Both words share the same initial consonant phoneme (/r/) which is what defines their beginning sounds as similar or identical in this case.<|eot_id|>
holderbank, hothouses, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, they do.Justification: The word "holder" starts with the /h/ sound (a voiceless glottal fricative), while the word "hothouses" also begins with this exact same sound (/h/) followed by other sounds in its sequence ("o", "t"). Since both words share the identical starting phoneme "/h/", I conclude that yes, they indeed start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
sahli, centimetres, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sahli" begins with /s/, which is also the starting consonant of the phrase "centi-metres". In English, both words have different vowel sounds after their initial /s/. However, in phonetics, they share the same beginning consonantal sound (/s/) despite having distinct pronunciations due to differences in vowels following them (e.g., ah-lee vs cen-tree-me-ters).<|eot_id|>
lomba, listen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lomba" starts with the letter combination "L-B", which represents the /ɫbʰ/ phoneme, while the word "listen" also begins with the letters "L-S-T-N". Although they have different starting sounds in terms of individual letters (B vs T), both start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant /l/, often transcribed as [l] or [ḷ]. This is considered to share
shelly, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelly" begins with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present in the prefix "prom-" (short for "promise"). Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("p"), both sounds start with the voiceless postalveolar fricative (/ʃ/) or its equivalent phonetic representation ([f] before vowels). This similarity justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
annex, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "annex" begins with the letter combination "/n/" which represents the voiceless alveolar nasal stop /nʰ/, while the surname "Roesner" starts with the letters "r". Although they don't share exactly the same starting sounds, both start with different forms of the voiced or unvoiced labiovelar approximants (/ɹ/) in English phonetics. In this case, I consider them to have similar enough conson
kissling, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The first word "kissling" begins with /ks/, while the second word "oslo" starts with /o/. These two sounds are not identical, hence they do not share the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
murdock, mogensen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "murdock" begins with the /m/ consonant sound, while the word "Mogensen" also starts with the /m/ consonant sound. Both words share this initial identical phoneme (sound), which is why they can be considered as beginning with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
weist, weldon's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "weist" begins with /w/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of "Weldon's". In this case, both words start with the voiceless labiovelar approximant phoneme (/ʷ/) in English orthography. This justifies my initial response as being correct.<|eot_id|>
papago, peterpaul, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "papago" and "PeterPaul" start with the letter combination /p/. The letters in each word may differ, but they share the initial phoneme of /p/, which represents the voiceless bilabial plosive stop consonantal sound. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two phrases do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
scholey, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholey" begins with the /sk/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "Ken", where 'K' makes that exact sound when pronounced as a voiceless velar plosive (the first phoneme).<|eot_id|>
kanne, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kanne" starts with the /kn/ consonant combination, which is pronounced as a single phoneme in English (the voiceless nasal plosive followed by the velar stop). Similarly, the word "smullen" also begins with the /s/ consonant sound, often represented as [z] or [θ]. Although they may not appear to have identical sounds at first glance due to their different letters, both start with distinct but similar stops
huguet, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "hug" in "huguét" and "g" in "gemme" start with /h/, which indicates they share the same initial consonantal phoneme, making them homophonous for speakers of French (since I assume this context). In linguistics terms, we can say that their onset sounds (/huɡuˈtɛ/) and (/ʒəm]) have identical starting points despite being different letters. This similarity
seider, olokuei's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "seider" starts with the letter combination "s-d", which is pronounced as /sd/. On the other hand, the second word "olokuei"s doesn't have any visible consonants that start with the exact same phoneme (/sd/) because of its unique spelling. However, if we break down each individual character in the word, we can find some similar sounds:* O-lo-k-u-e-i	+ L (not exactly
talk, turban, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "talk" begins with the /t/ consonant sound, while the word "turban" also starts with the /t/ consonant sound. Therefore, they both share the same initial consonant phoneme (/t/) which is what defines their beginning sounds in this context of comparison.<|eot_id|>
nix, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nix" starts with the /nk/ consonant combination, while the word "gemme" (an archaic or poetic term for gem) also begins with the /gk/ sequence of sounds, which is often pronounced as a single unit starting with the voiced velar stop consonant /ɡ/. Although not identical, both start with similar voiceless-voiced pairs (/tʃ/, /dʒ/) followed by a vowel in
voices, varnell, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "voices" begins with /v/, which is also the starting letter of the consonant sound in the word "varnell". The justification for this response lies in phonetics, where we consider that both sounds (/v/) share similar acoustic properties as they belong to the category of voiced labiovelar fricatives or approximants (the exact classification may vary depending on linguistic frameworks). This similarity enables us to conclude that these two words start with identical consonantal characteristics.
schaal, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "schall" begins with /ʃ/, which is a voiceless postalveolar fricative, while the second name "Kapuściński" starts with /k/. Although they do not share exactly the same letter ("S" vs "K"), both sounds can be considered as starting with a similar consonantal value of [ks], often referred to in phonetics as a single consonant cluster or coarticulation. Therefore, I
sowed, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" begins with /sw/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme (a combination of sounds) in English, whereas the first syllable "zoe-" in "zeoli" starts with the distinct sound /z/. Although they may look similar at first glance, their pronunciation differs slightly due to the presence or absence of certain speech sounds within each word's initial sequence.<|eot_id|>
curren, kostek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "curren" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "kostek". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless velar plosive stop consonantal sound represented by the letter combination 'ck'. This shared starting point indicates that they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
leona, legislators', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "leona" begins with the letter combination /l/, which is pronounced as a voiced alveolar lateral approximant, whereas the word "legislators'" starts with the letters "L", also representing that exact sound (/l/). Both words share this identical beginning consonantal phoneme.<|eot_id|>
oecd, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "oecd" begins with the /k/ or /ks/ (depending on pronunciation) phoneme, while the word "electoral" also starts with the /l/ phoneme. Although they do not share exactly identical letters ("c" vs. "L"), both sounds can be considered as starting with similar consonantal qualities (/kl-/) in English language. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two sets of words start with the same consonant
orson, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "orson" begins with the /oʊr/ sound, which starts with the letter combination of 'O' followed by two letters (R). Similarly, the word "primo" also begins with the /priːmoʊ/ sound, where the first part "/pri/" includes the consonants P-R-I that start together as one phonetic unit representing the single consonantal sound /PR/. Although they have different spellings and
fullman, federalists, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "fullman" begins with the letter combination /fʊl/, which starts with the voiceless labiodental fricative phoneme /f/. The word "Federalist", on the other hand, begins with the letters "F-e-d-", also starting with the voiced bilabial plosive phoneme /f/.Although they share the identical spelling of their first letters ("F"), both words start with distinct sounds: /f/ in "Fullman"
keanu, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The first word, "keanu", begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the second word, "kapuscinski", also starts with the /k/ consonant sound. Therefore, both words share the same initial consonant phoneme (/k/) despite having different vowel sounds following them.<|eot_id|>
sail, saunders', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sail" starts with the /s/ consonant sound, while the surname "Saunders'" also begins with the /s/ consonant sound. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/s/) even though they have different letters (l and ndr respectively).<|eot_id|>
merwe, milke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "merwe" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "milke". Both sounds start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonant phoneme /m/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
curren, coler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that both "c" in "current" and "col-" in "color" start with the /k/ or hard "C" phoneme, which is considered to have the same consonant sound. In linguistics, sounds can vary across languages but when we compare similar-sounding letters like "c", they typically share some common characteristics such as place of articulation (in this case, velar) and manner of articulation (stops). This similarity
boerner, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "boerner" starts with the letter combination /b/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, while the second word "Locatelli" also begins with the letters "/l/", which represent another distinct phonemic unit in English language. However, both sounds can be considered to start with similar voiceless alveolar plosive (/p/) or lateral approximant (//) depending on how one chooses to transcribe them using International Phonetic Alphabet
title, tate's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "title" starts with the /t/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the phrase "tat'e"s (a possessive form). Both start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal phoneme /t/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
postdating, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "postdating" begins with the /p/ consonant sound, while the word "cona" (which is likely referring to ConA) also starts with the /k/ or /kn/ sounds depending on how you pronounce it. However, both of these consonants (/p/, /k/) share similar characteristics as stop consonants in English phonology. In this sense, we can argue that they start with roughly the same type of consonantal sound despite
knicks', priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "knicks'" begins with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "Priam" starts with the /p/ consonant sound. Since they do not share the same initial consonant sound (/k/ vs./p/, respectively), my response is No initially. However, upon re-examination of the question, I realized that there's no space between "'-prior", which means we should consider only one unit for each word ("Knicks
schaal, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "Schaal" begins with /ʃ/, which is also known as the voiceless postalveolar fricative, while the word "Khomeini" begins with /k/. Although they have different letters (c/s), both sounds start with a similar place of articulation in the mouth, specifically at or near the alveolus/palatine region, making them share a common consonantal feature - starting with a stop/k sound. This
aborn, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "aborn" begins with the letter combination "/b/", which represents a voiced bilabial plosive (the /b/ sound). Similarly, the word "jemmie" also starts with the letters "/j-", which represent a voiceless postalveolar affricate (the /dʒ/ or "soft ch" sound in English).Although they may not share identical spellings (/b/ vs. /dʜ/,), both words
kin, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kin" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "jammer". Therefore, they both start with the same consonant sound /k/.<|eot_id|>
saudi, homeowner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" begins with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "homeowner", specifically in the prefix "hom-". Although they have different meanings, their initial sounds share the common characteristic of being pronounced as /s/.<|eot_id|>
breighner, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "breignher" starts with /b/, which is also the starting letter of the second word, "jama". Both words start with the voiced bilabial stop consonantal sound /b/.<|eot_id|>
shunted, schier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shunted" begins with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present in the prefix "sch-" of the word "schiefer". Although they differ slightly (the first one has a voiceless postalveolar fricative [ʃ], while the second one starts with a palatalized alveolo-palatal affricate [ç]), both sounds can be considered as beginning with the same consonantal phoneme (/š/) or
cow's, kostek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cow" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "kosten" (assuming that is what you meant by "kostek") also begins with the /k/ consonant sound. Since both start with the same initial letter (/c/) which represents the voiceless velar plosive phoneme in English, I conclude that they share the same consonant sound at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
dunks, dangerfield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dunks" starts with the letter combination /dnk/, which begins with the voiceless dental stop consonantal sound (/d/) followed by the nasal vowel sound (/n/) and finally, the velar plosive consonantal sound (/k/). Similarly, the word "dangerfield" also starts with the letters "/dr-", which represents another instance of the voiced alveolar fricative consonantal sound (/d/) in conjunction with the liquid approx
dunton, durgin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "dun" in "Dunton" and "dur" in "Durgin" start with /d/, which represents the same consonant sound, specifically the voiced dental stop [d]. The difference lies only in their vowel sounds following this initial consonantal phoneme (/n/ vs. /g/) but not affecting the starting point of each word's pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
shelley, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelley" begins with the /ʃ/ (sharp-sh) consonant sound, while the word "Kearn" starts with the /k/ consonant sound. Although they don't share exactly the same letter ("s" vs. "k"), both sounds can be considered as having similar characteristics in terms of their place and manner of articulation within the phonetic spectrum. Therefore, I conclude that the two words do start with the same conson
soeder, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "soeder" starts with /s/, which is also the starting letter of "/h/" in "Hannam". Although they look different, both letters have similar sounds when pronounced (the voiceless alveolar fricative). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do start with the same consonant sound (/s/) or at least share similarities between their initial consonants' phonetic values.<|eot_id|>
corsica, cop, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "corsica" starts with the letter combination "/k/", which is pronounced as /ks/, while the word "cop" also begins with the letters "/c/" followed by the sounds /p/. Although they have different vowel combinations, both start with the voiceless alveolar plosive stop consonant /kʰ/ or its variant /t͡sʼ/, making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
peele, patlan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "peel" begins with the /p/ sound, which is also present at the start of the second word "patlan". Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound (/p/).<|eot_id|>
lockers, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lockers" starts with the /l/ consonant sound, while the name "Jimmie" also begins with the /j/ or /dʒ/ (depending on regional pronunciation) which is often considered to have a similar sound to /k/. While they may not seem identical at first glance, linguistically speaking, both sounds can be classified as approximants of the alveolar type (/l/, /r/) or interdentals
donsbach, dehn, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dsons" begins with the /ds/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "dehn". Both sounds share the common letter combination "/ds/" or more specifically, both start with the voiceless alveolar stop followed by the voiced dental fricative (/t͡s/). This justifies my initial response that they indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
kainer, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kainer" starts with the letter combination /kn/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, whereas the word "jammu" begins with the letters /jm/. Although they don't share identical initial letters (/k/ vs. /j/), both sounds involve voiced labiovelar stops (the "k" or "km" in "kainer", and the "j" in "jammu"), making them similar enough to consider starting with
cayne, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cayne" begins with the /k/ consonant, while the word "rossin" also starts with the /r/ or sometimes approximated as /rs/, which is often represented by a single letter in English orthography (e.g., r). Although they don't share exactly the same phoneme (/ks/) due to differences between spoken language sounds and written representations of them, I'm considering this question from the perspective of standard English spelling rules.
sayad's, silver's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sayad" starts with the letter combination "/s/" which is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar fricative, whereas the word "silver"s starts also with the letters "/sl-" followed by "-ver-", but for phonological purposes we can consider only the initial sounds /s/. Both start with this common consonantal sound /s/, so they share that feature in their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
solder, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "solder" begins with the /s/ sound, while the word "jam" also starts with the /j/ or /dʒ/ (depending on pronunciation) which is often represented as /z/. Although they may seem different at first glance, in phonetics, both sounds can be transcribed to [dz] or similar, indicating that they share a common origin from Old English's /ds/, /tsr/, etc., all of them
curren, cappo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "c" in "current" and "c" in "capo" start with the /k/ phoneme, which represents the voiceless velar stop consonantal sound (/tʃ/) or [k] depending on linguistic context. Therefore, they share the same consonant sound, specifically starting with /k/.<|eot_id|>
o'connor, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "o'Connor" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the name "Jimmie". The apostrophe in "O'Connor" does not affect the starting consonantal sound, as it's only separating two parts of the surname or indicating possession (in this case). Therefore, both names start with the /k/ sound, making them share the same consonant phoneme.<|eot_id|>
kin, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kin" starts with the /k/ sound, while the word "Summerlin" also begins with the /s/ (which is often pronounced as a soft /sh/) or /sm/. Although they may look similar at first glance, both sounds differ from one another in terms of their phonetic characteristics. However, when considering that English has various acceptable ways to pronounce certain letters and letter combinations ("c" before vowels can sometimes have different pronunciations),
huxford, hypo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "huxford" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "hypo". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/h/) despite having different letters (x vs y).<|eot_id|>
coler, calipers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "coler" starts with /k/, which is also the first letter of the word "caliper", starting with "/c/" (which sounds like /kl/) when pronounced in English, as both letters have similar voiceless velar stop phonations (/kːrʰɛpərz/). Although not exactly identical, they share a similar beginning sound due to their shared Latin root ("color-" vs "-cil-").<|eot_id|>
huto, huss, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "huto" and "huss" both start with the letter /h/, which is the same consonant sound in English phonetics. In linguistics, this phenomenon is called homorganicity or initial consonantal assimilation, where two adjacent sounds share similar characteristics such as place of articulation (in this case, labial). Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do indeed begin with the same consonant sound (/h/).<|eot_id|>
beasts, birks, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "beasts" starts with the /b/ consonant, while the word "birks" also begins with the /brk/, which is pronounced similarly to /b/. In phonetics, both sounds can be transcribed as [b] or [p], indicating that they share similar characteristics despite being written differently in English orthography (the letter combination "br" having its own unique pronunciation). Therefore, I conclude that the two sets of words start with
hermon, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hermon" starts with the /h/ sound, while the word "rossin" also begins with the /r/ sound (which is sometimes pronounced as /hr/, but in this case, I assume you meant to write just "/r"). Although they may look similar at first glance, their initial sounds differ. However, if we consider only the start of each syllable ("Her-" vs "-Ross"), both sequences do indeed contain the /H/
fiel, faison, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fiel" starts with the /f/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "Faison". Although they have different letters (L vs S), their sounds (/l/ vs /s/) both come from the same phoneme /f/. This indicates that they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
goward, gochnauer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "goward" starts with the /g/ sound, which is also present in the second word "gochner". Both words start with the same initial consonantal phoneme "/g/", making them share similar sounds at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
sahli, salvage, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sahli" starts with /s/, which is also the starting consonant of the second word, "salvage". Both words share this common initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) in their pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
minogue, mench, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "minogue" and "mench" start with the /m/ consonant sound.Justification: The letters in each word that come before their respective vowels (i.e., 'n' for both) make up what is known as the onset of a syllable or phoneme. In this case, the onsets are identical (/mn/) indicating they share the same initial consonantal quality. This similarity can affect how we perceive and pronounce them when spoken together in sentences or
kempker, caterpillars, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kempker" starts with the letter combination /km/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme, represented by the symbol "/k/. On the other hand, the first part of the compound noun "caterpillar" begins with the letters "cat", but since we're considering only the initial consonantal sounds, we focus on the individual sounds rather than their actual spelling or formation in English orthography. In this case, both start with the voiceless
belkin, bidcos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "belkin" begins with the letter combination /bɛl/, which starts with the voiceless bilabial plosive consonant sound (/p/) followed by vowel sounds. Similarly, the second word "bidcos" begins with the letters "bcd", where all three letters start with the voiced labiodental fricative consonant sound (/v/). Although they have different phonetic transcriptions, both words initiate their pronunciation with similar conson
peterpaul, pans, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "Peter" starts with the /P/ consonant, which is also present at the beginning of both parts ("Paul-" and "-pants") in the phrase "peterpaul-pants". Therefore, all three words start with the same consonant sound (/P/).<|eot_id|>
saudi, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" starts with the letter combination /sw/, which includes the consonants S (voiceless alveolar fricative) and W (voiced labiovelar approximant). Similarly, the word "nex" also begins with the letters N (nasalized velar nasal stop) and X (voiceless dental or postalveolar sibilant affricate), but in this case, we can simplify to just considering them as
game, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "game" begins with the /g/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "caen". Both sounds share the same phoneme (/k/) followed by different vowels (a/e). This similarity in initial consonantal quality can lead to confusion or association between two words that start with similar but not identical sounds. In this case, both words have distinct meanings ("to play/to win" vs. "Caen", a city), yet
holes, hyman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "holes" begins with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "hyman". Both sounds share the identical phoneme "/h/", making them start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
barbre, bulges, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "bar" in "barrre" (assuming you meant to type "barbe", which refers to Barbare, a feminine name) and "bulg" in "bulge"s start with the /br/ and /bl/ sounds respectively, but they can also be transcribed as /bər/ and /bʌlg/, where we see that they share the initial /b/ consonantal phoneme or sound. Therefore, I
potteiger, panton, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that both "pot" in "pottieger" and "pan" in "Panton" start with the /p/ consonant sound, which makes them identical as far as their beginning sounds go. The rest of each word's spelling may differ (e.g., additional letters or diacritics), but from a phonetic perspective, they share the initial consonantal quality represented by the letter combination 'pp' followed by another vowel-consonant
olokuei's, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "olokuei" starts with the letter combination /o-l/, which represents the sounds of two distinct letters, but since they appear together as one unit in English orthography (the digraph "OL"), we can consider them to share the initial consonantal quality of being voiced labials (/m/) or bilabial stops (/p/b). On the other hand, the prefix "n-y-" is commonly seen in Greek-derived terms like "Nyx
gillem, godman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "gillem" starts with the letter combination /gɪl/, which begins with the voiceless velar stop consonantal sound /g/. Similarly, the second word "godman" also starts with the letters "/gd/", which again represents the voiced dental or alveolar stop consonantal sound /d/. Although they have different sounds (/g/ vs./d/), in phonetics, both can be considered as starting with the consonant sound
canney, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "canney" begins with the /k/ sound, which is also present in the word "reasner", starting from the first letter 'r'. Although they have different sounds (/n/ for "reaser"), both letters share the initial consonantal phoneme /k/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words start with the same consonant sound, specifically /k/.<|eot_id|>
sudd, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sudd" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "gaetano". Although they don't share identical letters (e.g., both start with 'S' or 'T'), their sounds (/s/) match when pronounced correctly in English. This justifies my initial response as being accurate - yes, the two sets of words do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
finstrom, fullman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "finstrom" starts with the /f/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "fullman".

Although they differ in spelling and meaning, both share this common initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) followed by another distinct letter combination (/"k"/ for scholar and "/r"/ or silent sounds for Arsenaeu). This shared starting point indicates that the two names start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
voorhies, vollmar, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "voorhies" begins with the /v/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Vollmar". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless labiodental fricative [v], making them share the same initial consonantal sound (/v/) despite having different letters (oohr-hiz vs Voll-mar). This similarity can be observed when pronouncing each word aloud or examining their orth
mauch, milke, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "mauch" starts with the letter combination /mɑʊt͡ʃ/, which has the sounds of "/m/" (the voiceless bilabial nasal) followed by "/a/" (an open front unrounded vowel), then "/u/" (a close back rounded vowel), and finally "/tʃ/" (voice postalveolar affricate). The first two letters, "/m/" and "/a/", make
dorow, deal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dorow" begins with /dr/, which is a combination of two sounds: /d/ (a voiced alveolar stop) followed by /r/. The word "deal", on the other hand, also starts with /dl/, where again we have /d/ as one part and /l/ as another. Although they're not identical (/tr vs./ dl), both start with the voiceless dental/alveolar plosive /d/. This makes

This similarity makes them share similar starting points despite being different letters (e.g., 'W' vs.'k'). The phonetic representation would show this: [ˈwiːtsnər] for Weitzner and [ˈv
lusser, lies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lusser" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "lies". Both words start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (/l/) consonantal phoneme.<|eot_id|>
boyington, beasts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "boyington" starts with the /b/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "beasts". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words have the identical initial consonantal segment /b/, indicating that they share the same starting point or onset (the first part of each syllable). In linguistics, sounds within speech can vary depending on regional accents, pronunciation variations among speakers, etc., but here we're considering
suder, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "suder" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "heman", starting from "/hm/", where the /m/ sounds like a soft /n/. Although there's no exact match between the two initial letters (/S/ vs./H/,), they both start with similar sounding consonants in this case. In phonetics, we call such cases as assimilation or convergence towards more common speech patterns.
shelor, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelor" starts with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "zele". Both sounds start with the voiceless postalveolar fricative phoneme (/ʃ/) followed by different vowels. Therefore, both words share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
side, hammann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the name "Hammann" starts with the /h/ consonant sound. Although they do not have exactly identical letters (e.g., both start with different vowels), in phonetics, sounds like /s/ and /h/ can be considered part of the same broad category as stops or fricatives, which is often referred to as the "same consonantal onset". Therefore,
julia, jannock, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "julia" starts with the letter combination "/ju/", which represents the /dʒuː/ phoneme, while the word "Jannock" begins with the letters "jn", representing the /dn/ or /tɳn/ sounds in some accents (the exact pronunciation may vary depending on regional variations). Despite differences in their individual pronunciations, both start with the initial consonantal sequence of [dj] or similar approximations
haggart, huxford, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "haggard" begins with the /h/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "Huxford". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/h/) justifying my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
health, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "health" begins with the /h/ sound, while the word "brony" (which is likely referring to My Little Pony) starts with the /b/ sound. These two sounds are different in both their phonetic representation (/h/) vs. (/b/) and their articulation (voiceless glottal fricative vs. voiced bilabial stop). Therefore, they do not share the same consonant sound at all.<|eot_id|>
soady, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "soady" starts with the /s/ sound, while the word "jama" also begins with the /j/ or sometimes pronounced as /dʒ/, which is often considered to have a similar pronunciation (or allophone) of /z/. Therefore, I consider them to start with the same consonant sound (/s/) for practical purposes in phonetics. However, linguistically speaking, some might argue that they do not share exactly the same
donne, dileo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "donne" begins with the /d/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "dileo". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words share the identical initial consonantal phoneme /d/, indicating that they start with the same consonant sound. In linguistic terms, this means their onsets (the sounds preceding the vowel) have similar acoustic properties due to the presence of the voiceless alveolar stop [t]. This
homan, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "homan" begins with the letter combination /hw/, which is often represented by the single phoneme /h/. On the other hand, the word "primo" starts with the letters "p-r", representing the distinct sounds of voiceless alveolar plosive (/p/) followed by voiced dental fricative (/r/). Since they don't share the exact identical initial consonantal sound (i.e., /h/ vs./
dewinter, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dewinter" starts with the letter combination /dw/, which represents the voiceless alveolar stop followed by the voiced labiodental fricative, while the word "roscene" begins with the letters /rs/. Although they may not appear identical at first glance, both start with the /r/ or /dr/ sounds in English phonetics, making them share similar consonantal beginnings.<|eot_id|>
lacaze, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "lacaze" starts with the letter combination /l/, which is pronounced as a distinct consonantal sound, whereas the second word "enex" begins with the letters "/n/" followed by another vowel sound, but not necessarily forming a separate consonantal onset (the English pronunciation of this sequence would likely involve a single nasalized or voiced-alveolar stop). Despite some differences in their actual phonetic realizations, both sounds can be approximated to start
belier, billboard's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "belier" starts with /b/, which is also the starting letter of the consonantal cluster in the phrase "billboard". The phonetic transcription for this would be: /ˈbiərɪrbɔrd/. Both sounds start with the voiceless bilabial stop, represented by "/b/" or [p]. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hermann, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "h" in Hermann and Haggart start with the /h/ phoneme, which represents the same consonant sound. This means they share similar pronunciation characteristics at their beginning.<|eot_id|>
sued, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "sued" and "alcoa"s start with the /s/ sound, which is considered as a single phoneme in English language. The word "Alcoa", being proper noun, may have different pronunciation or accents when spoken by people from various regions, but linguistically speaking, they share the initial consonantal sound of /s/.<|eot_id|>
easel, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "easel" begins with /s/, which is also the starting point of the second word, "germer". Both words share this common initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) in their sounds.<|eot_id|>
corsica, kellough, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "corsica" starts with the letter combination /k/, which is pronounced as a voiceless velar plosive (the "c" in English). Similarly, the word "Kellough" also begins with the letter "K", which represents the same voiced or unvoiced alveolar stop consonantal sound (/k/) when spoken by most native speakers of English languages. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound "/k/" which
hillenbrand, holderbank, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: Both "hill" in Hillenbrand and "holder" in Holderbank start with the /h/ consonant sound, which is why they can be considered as starting with the same consonant sound. The rest of the word following this initial letter remains different for each name (e.g., -len- vs. -er-bank), but their shared beginning consonantal phoneme makes them comparable at that level.<|eot_id|>
saad, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saad" begins with /s/, which is also the starting letter of the consonantal part in the combination "-zel", where "/z/" represents that initial consonant sound. Therefore, both words start with the same phonetic unit, specifically the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/.<|eot_id|>
gullible, ginsburg, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gullible" starts with the /g/ consonant sound, which is also present in the word "Ginsberg". The correct spelling of Justice Ginsburg's name should have been written as "Ruth Bader Ginsburg", but I assume you meant to ask about her first or last name starting with the letter G, both beginning with the /g/ consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
lockouts, litchfield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lockouts" begins with /l/, which is also the starting letter of the second word, "Litchfield". Both share the same initial consonant sound "/l/", making them phonetically similar at their onset.<|eot_id|>
zulu, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zulu" starts with the letter combination /zu/, which begins with the voiced thorn (θ) or interdental fricative phoneme, while the name "Rasner" starts with the letter R, also beginning with a voiceless alveolar trill (/r/) that is often transcribed as [ʁ]. Although they don't share exactly the same physical letters at first glance ("Z" vs "R"), both sounds can
geitner, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "geitner" starts with the /g/ sound, while the name "Jimmy" also begins with the /j/ sound. Although they may look similar at first glance, their initial sounds differ in that /g/ is voiced (made by blocking airflow through the vocal cords) whereas /j/ is voiceless (made without vibrating the vocal cords). However, from a phonetic perspective, both start with what's called a glottal stop or
feces, fetters, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "feces" and "fetters" start with the /f/ consonant sound, which makes them share the same initial consonant phoneme. The sounds /k/, /t/, or any other consonants come after this shared starting point in each word's pronunciation. This similarity can help distinguish between different answers when comparing two sets of letters at the beginning of distinct English vocabulary items like "feces" and "fetters".<|eot_id|>
halbig, holbert, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "hal" in "Halbig" and "hol" in "Holbert" start with the /h/ consonant sound.Justification:* The word "halbig" starts with the letters H-A-L-B-I-G.* The first three letters ("HAL") make up the beginning of the word, which is pronounced as one syllable starting with the voiceless glottal fricative (/h/) followed by a vowel sound (the letter combination -AL-
mentioning, madrigals, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "mentioning" and "madrigals" start with the /m/ sound.Justification: The word "mentioning" begins with the letter combination "/men-", which is pronounced as /ˈmentʃɪŋ/. Similarly, the word "madrigals" starts with the letters "/ma-", which is also pronounced as /ˌmædriˈgælz/. Both words have the initial consonantal phoneme /m/, making
minogue, madelyn, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "minouge" and "Madelyn" start with the /m/ consonant sound.Justification: The letters 'M' in both words initiate the pronunciation of each word, which is typically pronounced as /ˈmaɪnəuɡ/ for Minogue and /meɪdəlɪn/ or /miːdejn/ for Madelyn (depending on regional accents). Since they share this initial letter, we can conclude
alcoa's, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "alcoa" starts with /ˈælkəʊ/, which begins with the letter combination of 'A-L-K', whereas, the second part "-necks" starts with /n/. Although they don't share identical letters (e.g., both start with 'N'), their initial sounds (/l/ in "alko-" vs. /n/) can still differ from each other.However, if you're considering only single-conson
lag, lockouts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "lag" and "lockouts" start with the /l/ consonant sound.Justification:The word "lag" begins with the phoneme /l/, which is pronounced as a voiced alveolar lateral approximant (the tongue touches or approaches the gum ridge behind the upper front teeth).Similarly, the phrase "lockouts" starts with the sequence of sounds "/lk/", but since English has no distinct vowel between two consecutive consonants in most cases, we can
game, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "game" begins with /g/, while the word "dewinter" does not start with any single letter or combination of letters that form a distinct consonant sound in English phonetics (the sequence "/dw/" is often considered as part of the vowel-consonant-vowel pattern, rather than a standalone consonantal onset). Therefore, I conclude that they do not share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
leedham, lob, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "le" in "Leedham" and "l" in "Lob" start with the /l/ sound, which is considered as the same consonant sound. In phonetics, this is known as voiceless alveolar lateral approximant (/ɬ/) or voiced labiodental fricative (//). The sounds may differ slightly depending on regional accents, but linguistically speaking, they share the same initial consonantal quality.<|eot_id|>
petrilla, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "pet" in "Petrilla" starts with the /p/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second part "zel". Therefore, both parts start with the same consonant sound "/p/" or more specifically, the voiceless alveolar stop /p/.<|eot_id|>
jamb, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "jamb" begins with the /j/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "electoral". Although they have different letters (J vs E), their sounds (/j/) match, indicating that both words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
fisherman, fagerberg, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fisherman" begins with the /f/ consonant sound, while the surname "Fagerberg" also starts with the /f/ consonant sound.

licker, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "licker" begins with the /l/ consonant sound, while the word "jama" also starts with the /j/ or sometimes written as /dʒ/, which is pronounced similarly to /t͡ʃ/. Although they may look different in writing, both sounds are considered approximants that start with a similar place of articulation (the tongue tip), making them equivalent for purposes of phonetic analysis. Therefore, I conclude that
turban, title, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "turban" starts with the /tr/ consonant digraph, which is pronounced as a single voiceless alveolar trill stop followed by a voiced dental fricative (approximately like the combination of the sounds in "try" and "thigh"). Similarly, the word "title" also begins with the /t/ phoneme, which represents a voiceless interdental or apical tap. Although they have different spellings, both start
czepiel, cimo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cz" is a digraph that represents the /tʃ/ or /ch/ phoneme, which begins with a voiceless palatalized alveolar affricate (a sharp 'k' sound). Both words ("czepiel" and "cimo") start with this exact combination of sounds, making them share the same initial consonantal feature. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
khanna, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "khanna" starts with the /k/ consonant sound, while the word "Primeaux" also begins with the /p/ consonant sound. However, in phonetics, there is no distinction between voiced (/v/) or voiceless (/p/, /t/, etc.) sounds for /k/. Therefore, both start with similar but not identical consonants (the closest approximation being that they share the postalveolar stop /kʰ/).
nix, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nix" begins with the /nk/ consonant digraph, while the second part of the phrase is "zorro-li", which starts with the /zr/ or /zɹ/ sounds (depending on pronunciation). Although they may not seem identical at first glance, both start with a voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by different consonants, making them share similar phonetic properties in terms of their initial consonantal
shiller, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shiller" starts with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "health". Both sounds share the same place and manner of articulation (alveolar), making them homorganic. Therefore, they can be considered to start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
ashley, contusion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ashley" starts with the /æʃ/ (ASH) sound, while the word "contusion" begins with the /kɑnˈtjuːzən/ (KON-tyoo-zhun) sound. Although they don't have exactly identical letters ("sh" vs. "kn"), both sounds start with a voiceless alveolar stop (/k/) followed by different vowels and suffixes, which
excelling, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "exc" in "excelling" starts with the /ks/ consonant sound, while the first letter of the name "Geremia" is also "G", which represents another instance of the /g/ or /j/ (soft G) consonant sound. Although they differ phonetically (/k/ vs /ɡ/,), both start with different but similar sounds that can be considered as part of the broader category of consonantal beginnings, making
seader, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seader" begins with /s/, which is also the starting point of the second word, "arison". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/s/) despite having different meanings or functions in their respective contexts. This similarity justifies my affirmative response to your inquiry about whether they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
doth, dole, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "doth" starts with the /d/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "dole". Both words have the identical initial consonantal phoneme /d/. Therefore, I conclude that they start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
mayoralty, midair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mayoralty" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "mid-air", as in "/maid-". The letters 'r' and '-' between them don't affect this similarity because they're not part of the initial consonantal sounds being compared. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/m/) justifying my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
gettin', multiprocessor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "get" in "gettin'" and "mulp-" in "multi-process-or" start with the /g/ or /k/ sounds.Justification:* The word "getin'" starts with the letter combination "gt", which is pronounced as a single phoneme (/t/) followed by a vowel.* Similarly, the prefix "mul-ti-pro-cess-or" begins with the letters "mpl-", but since English pronunciation often reduces consecutive consonants to a
lall, longenecker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lall" starts with the letter combination "ll", which represents the /l/ sound, while the surname "Longenecker" begins with the letters "L-N". Although they have different vowels following them ("a-" vs "-oneck-"), both start with the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant consonantal sound (/l/) represented by the single-letter abbreviation "L". Therefore, I conclude that yes, these words do indeed share the
gomer, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gomer" begins with the /g/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "Kisling", making them share the same initial consonant sound (/k/) when pronounced correctly (although the actual letter at that position might differ). This justifies my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
dime, dobyns, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dime" begins with the /d/ sound, which is also present in the first syllable of the name "Doby-ns", making them share the same starting consonant sound (/d/).<|eot_id|>

faculties, faison, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "faculties" starts with the /f/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "Faison". Although they have different spellings, their initial sounds match due to the identical letter combination "/fa/" in both cases. This similarity indicates that both words start with the same consonant sound (/f/).<|eot_id|>
morath, mutzman's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "morath" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "mutzman". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/m/).<|eot_id|>
brenner, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "brenner" begins with the /br/ sound, which is made up of two distinct sounds: /b/, represented by the letter 'B', followed by the voiceless alveolar fricative /r/. On the other hand, the word "jammu" starts with the single phoneme /ʤ/, also known as the voiced postalveolar affricate (the soft ch or zh). Although they do not share identical letters ("B" vs
fidelcor, fallout, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fidel" starts with the /f/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "fall". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound, specifically the voiceless labiodental fricative (/f/) in this case.<|eot_id|>
fisherman, fi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "fisherman" starts with the /f/ sound, which is also present in the second part "-fi". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both sounds belong to the voiceless labiodental fricative category of speech sounds (/p/, /tʃ/, or /s/) that start at the upper teeth region when articulating them. In essence, despite being different letters (F vs f), they share the identical beginning place-of-articulation
moisturizer, mench, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "moisturizer" begins with /m/, which is also the starting consonantal phoneme of the word "mench". Both sounds share the exact same beginning, making them identical in terms of their initial consonance. Therefore, I conclude that both words start with the same consonant sound (/m/).<|eot_id|>
seader, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seader" starts with the letter combination "/s/", which is pronounced as /sh/. Meanwhile, the second word "koehn" also begins with the letters "/k/" and "/h", but when spoken together, they form a similar consonantal cluster of /kh/, often transcribed in phonetic notation as /x/. Although not identical, both sounds share similarities that can make them seem like starting with the same consonant sound to some listeners or
breon, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word, "breon", starts with the letter combination "/br/", which represents the voiceless bilabial stop followed by the voiced labiodental fricative (the /b/ and /r/ sounds). Meanwhile, the second word, "primeaux", begins with the letters "/pr-", also representing the voiceless bilabial stop followed by another voiceless alveolar plosive (/p/ and /r/) or sometimes referred to as
sowed, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "sowed" starts with the letter combination /sw/, which includes the sounds of both letters, whereas the name "Jemmie" begins with the single consonantal phoneme /dʒ/. Although they don't share identical starting letters (/s/ vs./j/), their respective initial segments do not differ in terms of voicelessness or voiceness (both start as unvoiced stops). Therefore, I conclude that the two words' beginning
licker, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "licker" begins with the /l/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "jamber". Although they have different endings (-r vs -ber), both start with the identical phoneme (/l/) making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
bryon, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bryn" in "Bryan-" starts with the /br/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second part "-GermeR". Although they have different letters (the first one has 'y' while the other does not), their sounds (/br/) match, indicating that both start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
hermann, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hermann" starts with the letter combination /hɜːr/, which begins with the voiceless velar fricative phoneme /h/. Similarly, the word "bruney" also starts with the letters /b-r-ʌn-, -e-y/, where the first two sounds represent the voiced bilabial stop phoneme /b/ followed by the liquid approximant phoneme /r/. Both words start with different
molded, mauch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**The justification for this is that both "molded" and "mauled" start with the /m/ consonant sound, which is pronounced as a voiced bilabial stop (the lips come together to make a complete closure). The sounds are identical in their articulation, making them homophones when spoken by someone who speaks English fluently. In phonetics notation: [ˈmoʊldɪd] vs. [ˈmeɪk
ru, retailed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ru" in "retailored" begins with the /r/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the phrase "re-" in "retailed". Therefore, both phrases start with the same consonant sound (/r/).<|eot_id|>
eichen, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "eichen" begins with the /k/ or /kh/ (depending on language) phoneme, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "elcotel". Both sounds share the same initial consonantal quality (/k/) despite being represented by different letters ("E", "L"). Therefore, I conclude that both words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
solder, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "solder" starts with /s/, which is also the starting consonantal sound of the name "Jaimie", as in "/j/. Although they have different letters, both start with sounds that can be transcribed by English speakers using the phonetic notation system as beginning with /s/ or /j".<|eot_id|>
lob, listen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lob" begins with the /l/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "listen". Therefore, they share the same consonant sound (/l/) in their initial letters.<|eot_id|>
feces, fayme, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "feces" begins with the /f/ consonant sound, while the word "fame" (not "fayme", which is not a valid English spelling) also starts with the /f/ consonant sound. Therefore, they both share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/f/) despite having different vowels following them in their respective spellings.<|eot_id|>
rybolt, rodabaugh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "ry" in "Rybolt" and "r-" (the silent letter is not pronounced) in "Rodabaugh" start with the /r/ consonant sound.Justification: The sounds /r/ and /ry/ may seem different at first glance due to the presence of the vowel phoneme (/i/) after the initial consonantal sound /r/. However, when considering only the beginning part of each word ("ry" vs. "r"), we can
aside, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "aside" and "kanne" start with the /s/ consonant sound.Justification: The word "aside" begins with the letter combination "as", which represents the phonetic sounds of /æz/. Meanwhile, the word "kanné" starts with the letters "kn", representing the phonetic sounds of /n/. Although they have different spellings, their initial consonantal sounds (/s/) match in this case.<|eot_id|>
cedar, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || My response is: NO.Justification:The word "cedar" begins with the /k/ sound, whereas the word "premo" starts with the /p/ sound. These two sounds differ in their place of articulation (the way they're formed) as well as their phonetic properties, so I conclude that the words do not share the same consonant sound at all.<|eot_id|>
gillem, goebel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gillem" begins with the /g/ consonant, while the word "goebel" also starts with the /g/ consonant. Both share the identical initial consonantal phoneme /g/. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed start with the same consonant sound (/g/).<|eot_id|>
sheley, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheley" starts with the /sh/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Ken", as in "K". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/k/) even though they have different letters ("s" vs. "K"). Note that this justification assumes we're considering only the initial sounds, not their phonetic or linguistic implications beyond that point.<|eot_id|>
schaal, zaley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schaal" begins with /ʃ/, which is the voiceless postalveolar fricative, while the word "zaley" begins with /z/, which is voiced alveolar fricative. Although they have different phonetic transcriptions (/ʃ/ vs /z/), both sounds can be considered as starting with a similar consonantal quality of being a type of sibilance or hissing noise (the [sh] in
sawed, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sawed" begins with the /sw/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "brony". Although they have different letters ("w", "b"), their sounds in this context can be represented by the phonetic transcription "/sw/" for both. Therefore, I conclude that the two words start with the same consonant sound (/sw/.<|eot_id|>
luddites, lob, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lud" in both "Luddites" and "lob" starts with the /ld/ or /l-d/ combination, which is considered to have the same consonant sound (/d/ followed by a vowel). This similarity makes them phonetically equivalent at the beginning of each word.<|eot_id|>
circuit, sociopath, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "circuit" starts with /k/, which is also the starting consonant of the word "sociopath". Both words have the initial sounds /ks/.<|eot_id|>
schuller, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The first word "schuler" starts with the /sh/ sound, which is a common consonantal sequence in many languages. Similarly, the second word "barrineau" also begins with the /br/ or /bhr/ sounds (depending on how one pronounces French names), both of which can be considered as starting with the same general area within the oral cavity for producing similar consonants like /s/, /z/, /f/, etc., even
dials, dallas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dials" begins with the /d/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "Dallas". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words share the identical initial consonantal phone (/d/) despite having different vowels following them (the vowel sounds being distinct). In linguistics, when two or more phones appear together as part of a single syllable's onset, they form what we call a cluster; here, that cluster consists
beal, batan, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "be" in "beal" and "bat" in "baten" start with the /b/ consonant sound, which makes them identical phonetically. The letters following this initial consonantal sequence differ ("e", "a"), but their beginning sounds remain consistent (/b/).<|eot_id|>
heyman, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hey" in "Heyman" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "brun-" in "Bruner". Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound (/h/) despite having different letters (y/b).<|eot_id|>
o'shell, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o' shell" begins with the /sh/ consonant sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "Kissing". Although they may look different when written down, both sounds represent the voiceless postalveolar fricative phoneme /ʃ/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two sets of letters do indeed start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
lyke, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lyke" starts with /l/, which is also the starting letter of the consonantal part in the name "Jaimie", specifically, the letters "j". Although they have different vowel sounds after them ("y"/"a"), their initial consonants share the identical phoneme /lj/. Therefore, I conclude that both words start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
schlee, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sch" is a digraph that represents the /ʃ/ (sh) sound, which begins the first part of both "scheeze-l" and "z". Therefore, they share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
kellys, carrisyn, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kelly's" starts with the letter combination /k/, which is pronounced as a hard, sharp /k/ sound (voiceless velar stop). Similarly, the word "carrisyn" also begins with the letters /kr/, which produces the same voiceless velar stop sound /k/. Therefore, both words start with the same consonant sound /k/.<|eot_id|>
nussbaum, nicholas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "nussbaum" starts with the /ns/ consonant sound, while the word "Nicholas" also begins with the /nk/ or /ngk/ sounds (depending on regional pronunciation). Although they don't have exactly the same letter sequence (/s/, not /k/) at first glance, both combinations can produce similar voiceless nasal sounds when spoken aloud in English. Therefore, I consider them to share a similar consonant sound for practical purposes.<|eot_id|>
rasner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "ras" in "Rasner" and "elco" in "Elcotol" start with the /r/ or /l/ sounds, which can be considered as similar consonant sounds (alveolar trill). Although they're not exactly identical (/z/ vs /kl/, respectively), phonetically speaking, there's still some similarity between them.<|eot_id|>
hyman, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hyman" starts with the /h/ consonant sound, while the word "jaimie" also begins with the /j/ or sometimes transcribed as /dʒ/, which is often pronounced similarly to /h/. Although they may not seem identical at first glance, both sounds share similarities in their pronunciation, making them similar enough to consider starting from the same consonantal place. In phonetics, this phenomenon can occur due to assimilation processes
bruney, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "bruney" begins with the /b/ consonant sound, while the word "prima" starts with the silent letter combination "/p/" which is often pronounced as a soft vowel-like sound (/ɪrəmə/) or sometimes even dropped in speech (e.g., only pronouncing the remaining vowels). These two sounds do not match, so they cannot start with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
holes, hump, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "holes" starts with the /h/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the word "hump". Both words share this common starting consonantal phoneme (/h/) making them identical in terms of their initial sounds.<|eot_id|>
kanai, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kanai" begins with /k/, which is also the starting consonant of "baran". Both words start with the voiceless velar plosive consonant phoneme /k/. Therefore, they share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
reierson, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "rei" in "reison" (I assume you meant to type "person") and "elco" in "electol" (which is not a valid word) start with /r/, which means they share the same consonant sound.Justification: The initial sounds of two or more consecutive letters can form what linguists call onset clusters. In this case, we have "/ri/" followed by another cluster "/s/", making up the syllable "rei". Similarly
ikon, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ikon" starts with the /i/ or /k/ sounds, while the word "bruner" starts with the /b/ sound. Despite not being identical (/p/, for example), all three letters ("ik", "br") contain consonants that can produce similar voiceless stops (e.g., [t] in English) when pronounced by non-native speakers of certain languages like Germanic ones where retroflexion is less common. However, from
mixes, mamula, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "mixes" and "mamala" (not "mamula", which is not a valid word) start with the /m/ consonant sound.Justification: The first letter of each word is 'M', indicating that they share the same starting consonantal phoneme (/m/) in their pronunciation. This means that when we pronounce them aloud, our mouths move similarly to produce those sounds, making them homophones for this specific aspect – i.e., initial consonance
scholer, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholar" begins with the /skr/ sound, which is pronounced as a single phoneme (unit of sound). Similarly, the word "nix" also starts with the /nkz/ or /nx/ sounds, depending on regional accents and pronunciations. Although there may be slight variations in pronunciation across different dialects, both words can generally be considered to start with similar consonant sounds (/k/, /ks/) followed by distinct vowel
downstairs, dallas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "downstairs" begins with the /d/ consonant sound, which is also present in the beginning of the word "Dallas". Both words share this similar starting point, making them phonetically equivalent when considering their initial consonants sounds.<|eot_id|>
hillenbrand, hayen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hillenbrand" starts with the letter combination "/h-", which represents the voiceless glottal fricative /h/. Similarly, the word "hayen" also begins with the letters "/h-". Both words share this initial consonant sound of /h/, making them start with the same phoneme in English. Therefore, my response is affirmative that both words begin with the same consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
shunted, shootouts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, both "shunted" and "shootouts" start with the /ʃ/ consonant sound.Justification:The letters "s", "h", and "t" in "shunted" make up the phoneme /ʃ/, which is pronounced as a voiceless postalveolar fricative (a sharp hissing noise). Similarly, the letter combination "s", "h", "o", "u", "t"s in "shootouts" also starts with
dunton, dangerfield, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dunton" begins with the /d/ sound, which is also present at the start of the second word "dangerfield". Both words share this initial consonantal phoneme (/d/) despite having different letters ("n", "-nger") following it in each case. Therefore, they can be said to have the same consonant sound starting them off.<|eot_id|>
suder, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "suder" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "hannam" begins with the /h/ consonant sound. Since both sounds start with different letters (S vs H), they do not share the exact same consonant sound. However, in phonetics, when two words have similar but distinct starting sounds, we can consider them as sharing the same consonant sound for practical purposes. In this case, although /s
maue, mummy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "maure" begins with the /m/ consonant, which is also present in the beginning of the word "MUMMY", both starting with the exact same phoneme (/m/) or letter (the 13th alphabet). This similarity indicates that they share the same initial consonantal sound.<|eot_id|>
schuele, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuelle" begins with the /s/ consonant sound, while the word "reierson" also starts with the /r/ sound. However, in Germanic languages like English or Dutch (which might influence the pronunciation of this name), the letter combination "ch" is often pronounced as a voiceless palatal fricative approximant (/ʃ/) which sounds similar to /sh/. Therefore, although not exactly identical, both words start with
smullen, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "smullen" starts with the /s/ consonant, while the word "jemmie" also begins with the /j/ or sometimes written as /dʒ/, which is often pronounced similarly to the English letter combination "dj". Although they may not seem identical at first glance, both sounds can be represented by the phonetic symbol /ɡz/. This similarity in pronunciation justifies my affirmative response that the two words start with the same consonant
superwoman, salient, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "superwoman" starts with the /s/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "salient". Both words start with this identical consonantal phoneme (/s/) making them share the same initial consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
maue, metal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "maue" begins with the /m/ sound, which is also present in the beginning of the second word "metal". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both words start with the voiceless alveolar stop consonantal sound (/m/) followed by different vowels ("a", "e") respectively. This similarity justifies my affirmative reply that they share the same starting consonant sound.<|eot_id|>
topping, teamster's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "topping" starts with the /t/ sound, while the word "teamster's" also begins with the /t/ sound. Both sounds share the same initial consonantal phoneme (/t/) making them identical in terms of their starting point.<|eot_id|>
beal, birks, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "beal" starts with the /b/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second word "birks". The justification for this response lies in phonetics: both letters 'B' represent voiceless bilabial plosive sounds (/p/) or voiced labiodental fricative sounds (//) depending on their pronunciation context. In English orthography, however, they are written as distinct letterforms to distinguish between different words despite sharing similar starting
barbre, bieri, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "bar" in "Barbrea" (I assume you meant Barbre) starts with /br/, which is also present at the beginning of "beri" in "Bierie". The sounds /r/ and /er/ may seem different, but they share the initial consonantal phoneme /br/.<|eot_id|>
ikon, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ikon" starts with the letter combination /ik/, which represents the voiceless alveolar stop /k/. Similarly, the word "prom" also begins with the letters /pr/, where both instances of "p" represent voiced or unvoiced bilabial stops. Although they differ in their vowel sounds (o vs. o), the initial consonantal phonemes (/k/ and /p/) share similar characteristics as regards place and manner of articulation
kania, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "kania" and "germer" start with the /k/ or /kr/ sounds, which can be considered as having similar phonetic characteristics in terms of their articulation (the position and movement of lips, tongue, etc.) when spoken by native English speakers. The initial consonants share some similarities such as being voiced stops followed by continuative fricatives (/tʃ/) and therefore they could be argued to have started from the same place
