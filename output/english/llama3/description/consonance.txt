elapse, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "elapse" has the consonants /l/, /p/, and /s/. Meanwhile, the phrase "'lip's" (possessive form of "lip") also contains those same consonants (/l/, /p/, and /s/) in that order. Although they differ in their vowels ("e", "a" vs. none), since all three consonants match exactly between both instances, we can conclude that indeed, there exist identical consonant
okon, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "okon" has the consonants /k/, /n/, while the word "prem" also contains those same consonants, in that order (/p/, /r/, /m/. However, they differ in their vowel sound ("o", "/e"/). This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (in this case, //) with different vowel sounds (). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two sets of letters do meet the criteria
scour, scarry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "scour" starts with the /skɔr/ sound, which consists of the same consonants (/s/, /k/) as in the word "scarry", while having distinct vowels (/ɔʊ/ vs./er/i). The similarity between their initial consonantal sounds allows us to consider them similar despite differing vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
amado, murdaugh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is as follows:* The word "amado" has the consonants /m/, /d/ (or sometimes pronounced as /tj/) in its pronunciation.* Similarly, the word "murder" also contains the same sequence of consonants: /m/, /r/, /d/.* However, while both words share the same set of consonant phonemes (/mrd), they differ significantly in their vowels. In Spanish, "amado
lacaze, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lacaze" has the consonants /l/, /c*/, and /z*, while the word "cona" has the same consonants, specifically /k/* (which is pronounced similarly to English "/s/" in this context). However, they differ significantly in their vowels (/æ/ vs./o:/), making them distinct despite sharing similar consonantal sounds.<|eot_id|>
burdell, abdollah, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "burdell" contains the sound /r/, /b/, /l/, while the word "abdollah" also contains the same sounds, specifically /b/, /d**, **ll** (which is pronounced as a single /l/). Although they differ in their vowels (/u/ vs./a/) and possibly other phonetic details like stress or intonation, both words share similar consonantal patterns within them. Therefore, I conclude that yes,
boerner, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "boerner" and "jaimie" both contain the letter combination "-ner-" which represents the same consonant sound /nər/. However, they differ in their vowels: "o" in "Boerner" versus no vowel (or silent "i") in "Jaimie". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
morr, mer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two word pairs "morr-" (as in, for example, "morning") and "-mer" share similar or identical consonantal sounds /rm/. The difference lies only in their respective vowels: "or" vs. "e". This meets the criteria of having distinct yet alike consonants with disparate vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
sunday's, sandos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sunday" has the sound /sand-/, which includes the consonants 'S', 'N', and '-'. Similarly, the word "sandos" also starts with the same sequence of consonants '/Sand-'/. However, their vowels differ; Sunday ends in "-ay", while Sandos (a Spanish or Portuguese term) is pronounced as "/ˈsaɳðuz/" without any distinct ending like -ay. Therefore, they share similar
guertin, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guertin" has the consonants /g/, /r/, /t/, and /n/. Similarly, the word "Kenney" also contains the same set of consonants (/k/, /n/) in that order. However, their corresponding vowels differ; "u", "e" for "guertin" versus "e", "y" (sometimes pronounced as long 'i') for "Kenney". This indicates they share similar conson
alleco, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "alle" in "allelenger" and the first part of "generer", i.e., "gen-", do not share any similar letters except for 'r' which is also present at the end of both words, forming their plural forms "-ers". However, if we consider only the main parts without suffixes ("all-" vs. "gene"), they exhibit distinct consonantal patterns (LL/LR) despite having dissimilar vowels ('e'). This
shelley, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shelley" has the consonants /l/, /y/, and /n/. The word "conn" also has the same consonants, in that order: /k/, /õn/.Although they share similar-looking letters ("L", "N"), their pronunciation is slightly different due to the presence of distinct vowels (/eɪ/) versus no vowel sound (a silent letter combination "/ŋ/" followed by a glottal stop). This means we
tidy, tad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "t", "d" in the words "tidy" and "tad" represent identical consonant sounds, which is /t/. However, the vowels preceding them differ; "i" (in "tidy") has a distinct sound from "a" (in "tad"). Therefore, while they share similar consonants, their vowel sounds vary, making this statement true for the pair of words "tidy"- "tad".<|eot_id|>
luecke, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "luecke" has the consonants /k/, /c/, and/or other silent or voiced sounds, whereas "Jimmie" starts with the sound /dʒ/. Although they share some similarities in their spellings (e.g., both contain letters like 'u', 'e'), their pronunciation differs significantly due to distinct consonantal patterns. The vowels ("u", "i") also differ between the two words. Therefore, I conclude that the
leaders, lads, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "r", "d"s, and "s" in both "leaders" and "lads" represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes (/ɫ/, /tʃ/, /z/) respectively, whereas their vowels differ: "/iː/" (long i) vs "/æ/" (short 'a'). The similarity between the consonants makes them sound alike when spoken aloud, despite having distinct vocalic components. This phenomenon occurs frequently across
knacks, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "knack" has the consonants /k/, /n*/, and /*ck*, while the word "zuli" has no similar sequence of consonants, as its letters form distinct sound combinations (/*zu*li*/). Therefore, based on phonetic analysis, we can conclude that they do not share any identical consonant sounds. However, both words end with differing vowels: "*a*" in "knack", and *u*i or *u*l/i respectively
schley, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word phrase "schley" and "hamann" contain the same consonants ("h", "m", "n"), which suggests that they share similar or even identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ; in "schley," we see the letters "e" (a single-vowel sound) whereas in "hamann," there's no distinct vowel between the double-n consonants. This difference justifies my initial response as being affirmative to whether
catino, catain, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "catino" has the consonants /t/, /n/ (or sometimes pronounced as /ɪŋ/) while "catain" has the same consonants, i.e., /kæteɪn/. The difference lies in their vowels: "i" vs. "ate". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
guyton, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "guy-ton" has the same consonant sound /t/, whereas "nec-ais-e" also shares the same consonant sound /s/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "/y/" vs. "/e/", respectively. This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (both being single-stop consonants) with distinct vowel sounds (/y/ and /e/) making them phonetically distinguishable despite sharing similar endings (-on
orson, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "orson" ends with the consonant sound /n/, while the word "prom" also ends with the same consonant sound /m/. The only difference is in their vowels: "o-r-s-o-n" has two distinct vowel sounds ("o", then "r"), whereas "p-r-om" has one single-vowel sound combination ("o"). Since they share the same ending consonants (/n/ vs /m/) despite having differing vowel patterns, I
saad, shelor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "saad" has the same consonant sound /s/, while both vowels in each of the two words differ: "a" vs. "e". The consonants remain unchanged, whereas the vowels vary between short 'a' (in "saad") to long 'ē' (as part of the suffix "-lor"). Therefore, I conclude that they share identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
ikon, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "k" in both words ("ikon" and "orson") represent similar or identical consonant phonemes, which means they produce the same sound when pronounced (the /k/ sound). The difference lies only in their corresponding vowels: "i" in "ikon" versus "o" in "orson". These distinct vowel sounds change the overall pronunciation of each word while keeping its consonantal core intact. Therefore, we can conclude that there exist identical
saad, hamner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saad" has the consonants /s/, /a/, and /d/. On the other hand, the word "hamner" also starts with the same sequence of consonants (/h/, /m/, and /n/) followed by different vowels ("aa"). This indicates that they share similar consonant sounds despite having distinct vowel patterns in each word.<|eot_id|>
tsuda, shelor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "tsu" in Japanese has the same sound as the letter combination "tsh-" or "ch-". The phonetic transcription of this sound is /ʧ/. In English, we can approximate this sound by pronouncing the letters "church".On the other hand, the suffix "-er" in English typically represents a voiced alveolar fricative [r] (the sound made when saying "red"), whereas in Japanese, there's no direct equivalent for this
rosenow, rosano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "osen" in the word pair "rozenow-rozano" contain similar or identical consonant phonemes /z/, /n/. However, they differ in their corresponding vowel sound pairs "/o/" (in "rozenow") vs. "/a/" (in "rozan"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel sounds between them.<|eot_id|>
hert, hiott, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hert" has the /t/ sound as its initial consonant, while the word "hiott" also starts with the same /t/ sound (identical). The difference lies in their vowels: "hert" ends with "/ɜr/" whereas "hiott" ends with "/aʊət/", which means they differ only by having distinct vowel combinations despite sharing similar consonants.<|eot_id|>
curd, cod, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c" in both "curd" and "cod" represent the same sound, which is /k/. This means they share identical consonant sounds. However, the vowels preceding them differ: "/u/" (the letter combination "ur") in "curd", and "/o/" (a single letter) in "cod". Therefore, while the consonants match, the vowel sounds do not.<|eot_id|>
moody's, maids, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "moody" has the sound /dɪʒ/ in its consonants, while the word "maids" also has this same sound (/mædz/) for their consonants. The difference lies only in their vowels: "/uː/" (long 'o' or schwa) is present in "moody", whereas there is no such long-vowel sound ("i") in "maids". This justifies my affirmative response to your question about whether
nunn, gnann, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nun" has the letter combination /nʌn/, where "/n/" is the consonantal sound (a nasal stop) and "/ɑ/" is the vocalic part of the diphthong. On the other hand, the word "gnan(n)" or simply "gann", if you prefer to write it without the extra "(n)", starts with the digraph "/" followed by another consonental sound "/", which represents a voiced velar
baez, boos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "b", "z" in both "baez" and "booz" (corrected spelling of "boos") share similar phonetic properties, forming /bz/ sound combination which can be considered as having identical consonant sounds. However, the vowels differ: "a" in "baez" vs. "o" or sometimes silent "u" in "boo". This distinction justifies my affirmative response to your question.<|eot_id|>
bruner, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "bruner" and "germen" both contain the same consonant sound /r/, which is not changed in either word, indicating that they share this phonetic feature. However, their vowels differ; "bruner" has the diphthong "/uːɛ/" (pronounced as "oo-eh") whereas "germen" contains the monophthongic vowel combination "/eɪmən/", resulting in distinct
alaric, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "alaric" has the consonants /l/, /r**, and **c** (the letter combination is pronounced as one sound), while the word "Locatelli" also contains similar consonants, including /l/, /k/**t/. Although they share some common letters, their pronunciation differs due to distinct vowels in each case ("a" vs. "**o", respectively). This distinction demonstrates that both sets of words exhibit non-matching vowel phonemes
gaetano, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gaetano" has the consonant sound /tɛnəʊ/ (the combination of the letters 'T', 'A', 'E' in that order), while the phrase "health" has no similar consecutive consonants, only individual vowels. The justification for this response lies within phonetics: In linguistics, when comparing two sets of speech segments or syllables to determine if they share common features like consonantal similarity, we examine their constituent parts
sader, scholl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sader" has the sound /dər/ (the letter combination "dr"), while the word "scholl" has the sound /ʃɔl/ (the letter combinations "sh-o"). Although they differ in their vowels, both retain similar consonantal sounds (/d/, /t/) which makes them phonetically distinct yet share common consonants. This characteristic of having dissimilar vowel patterns with shared consonance is known as heteronyms or homographs.
lance, linsay, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lance" has the sound /ns/, which is the same as in the word "Lindsay". The only difference between them lies in their vowels, where "ace" (in "lance") corresponds to "i" or sometimes "ey", whereas "ind" (as part of Lindsay) represents either "ihnd" or "endy".In phonetics, this can be represented by:* Lance: ˈlæn.s* L
saudi, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "saudi" has the same consonant sound /dʒ/, while the word "sterilizations" also contains this exact same consonant sound (/zɪrˈtɛləsaɪʃnz). However, they differ in their respective vowels: "/a/" (in "saudi") versus multiple distinct vowel combinations ("i", "e", etc.) within "sterilizations". This meets the criteria for
kut, keto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kut" and "keto" both start with the same consonantal sound /kt/, which is pronounced similarly in each word, indicating that they share the same consonant phoneme (sound). However, their vowels differ - "/u/" in "kut" versus "/e/" in "keto". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
loker, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "l" and "c", as well as "k" and "t", in both "loker-" and "-locatelli" share similar or identical consonant sounds, respectively ("L"/"C" being voiceless alveolar stops, and "K"/"T" being voiceless dental stops). However, their corresponding vowels differ: "o"-like sound vs. closed front unrounded vowel /i/. The presence
paone, peon, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the letters "n" in both "paone-" and "-eon" represent similar or identical consonantal sound /n/, whereas their accompanying vowels, respectively, "a", "o", differ from each other (monophthongal open-mid back rounded vowel [ɔ] vs monophthongal close front unrounded vowel [æ]). This meets the criteria of having distinct yet matching consonants with disparate vocalic components between two phon
pols, ploys, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "l", "p" and "s" in both "pols" and "ploy's" (note: possessive form) represent the same sound, which means they share identical consonant sounds. The difference lies only in their corresponding vowels ("o" vs. "oy"), making them homographs with distinct pronunciations.<|eot_id|>
misspelled, misapplied, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "misspelled" has the consonants "sp", while the word "misapplied" also contains those same consonants ("sp"). However, they differ in their respective vowels (the first one is pronounced with "e" whereas the second one uses "i"), making them share similar consonant sounds but distinct vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
o'kane, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "o'KANE" has the consonants /k/, /n*/, while the word "BRAN" also contains the same consonants (/b/, /r/) followed by distinct vowels ('A', 'a'). The presence of apostrophes in "'O'" does not alter their phonetic value, so we can focus on the bare letters for our analysis.In this case, despite having different initial letterforms ("B", "K"), both sequences share similar conson
weirder, ward, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "weir" in "weirdly" has the sound /r/, which appears as the same consonant sound at the beginning of both "weirder" and "ward". The vowels, however, differ: "e" (long) in "weirder", whereas "a" (short) in "ward".In phonetics, this can be represented by:* Weirder: /wɜːrdər
ploys, apple's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ploys" has the consonants /pl/, which is similar to the beginning of the word "apple", where we find the consonants /pp/. The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "oys" (in "ploys") versus "a" (in "apples"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds, so I can confidently say that yes, they do share this characteristic!<|eot_id|>
gerk, gekko, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "r" in both "gerk-" and "-gerek-o" (in the word "Gekko") represent the same sound /rk/, which is considered as identical consonant sounds. The difference lies only in their combination with vowels, where "er" forms one phonetic unit whereas "e" has its own distinct pronunciation separately from "o". This distinction between vowel combinations does not change the fact that the underlying consonantal core remains
cycare, screw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cycare" has the letter combination /ks/, which is also present in the word "screw". This indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/k/ and /s/) despite having distinct vowels (/"y"/, "/a/", versus ""). Therefore, I conclude that yes, both words do indeed possess identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
cardoen, cardoni, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "cardone" and "Cardini" (not "cardeni") both contain the same sequence of consonants: /kr/, /d/, /n/. However, they differ in their vowels (/ɑːr.doʊn/ vs. /kərˈdiːni/) which makes them distinct phonetically despite having similar or identical consonantal features.<|eot_id|>
iacono, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "iacono-" has the letter combination "-cn-", which is pronounced as /kɛn/. Meanwhile, the suffix "-rose-" in "irosene" also contains the letters "rs", which can be represented by the phoneme /rəz/. Although they appear to share similar-looking consonants ("c/n" vs. "rs"), their actual pronunciation differs due to distinct vowels accompanying them. Therefore, I conclude that the two sets of consonantal
rosene, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of words, "rosen-" (rose) and "-ger" (gear), contain the same consonants ("s", "r") in both cases, while having distinct vowels ("-o-", "-e"). This satisfies the condition for identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
hammann, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hammann" has two consecutive'm' which represent /mm/, while in the word "noakes", there's also no repeated sound of any kind, including for vowels or other consonants. Therefore, they do not share similar consonant sounds (since none exist) despite having distinct meanings. However, since both contain separate instances of single-vowel letters ("a" & "o"), their vowel sounds differ as well.<|eot_id|>
zaley, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "z" and "s", as well as "l" and "r", in both "Zaley-" and "-Arseneau" represent similar or identical phonemes (sounds) respectively, whereas their accompanying vowels ("a" vs. "e") differ between the two names. In linguistics terms, this would describe them having homorganic consonants with distinct vowel qualities.<|eot_id|>
o'shell, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o-shell" has the same consonant sound /sh/, while having distinct vowel sounds (/o/ vs. no vowel). Similarly, in the second part of the phrase ("kis-ling"), we can identify two separate parts with similar consonantal components (-shell-ing) but differing vocalic elements (the vowels 'i' and 'in'). This satisfies our initial condition that they share equal consonant sounds yet exhibit varying vowel phonemes.<|eot_id|>
multiprocessor, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "multiprocessor" has the consonants 'p', 'r' and's', while the suffix "-nyx" also contains the same consonants ('n', 'y', 'k'). However, their vowel patterns differ; in "multiprocessor", we find 'u', 'i', 'o' (and sometimes another) whereas '-nyx' consists of only one distinct vowel sound, which is usually pronounced as /ɪ/. This
luck, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "luck" ends with the sound /k/, which is also present in the word "jumb". The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "uck" vs "imb", respectively. Therefore, they share similar consonantal endings while having distinct vocalic parts.<|eot_id|>
borneo, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "borneo" has the consonants /br/, /n/, /r/, and /o/. Meanwhile, the word "prem" (short for premiership) has the consonants /pr/, /ɛ/, /m/. Although they differ in their vowels (/o/ vs. /ɛ/), both sets of consonants share similar phonetic characteristics:* Both start with voiceless stops ("b"/"p")* Followed by
canney, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "canney" has the consonants /n/, /c/, and /y/ (which sometimes acts as a consonant), while the word "smullen" also contains those same consonants: /l/n, /m/. The difference lies in their vowels; "canney" ends with the sound /eɪ/ or /iː/ depending on regional accents, whereas "smullen" consists of the diphthong /
sidey, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" has the consonants /s/, /i/, and /d/. On the other hand, the surname "Summerlin" also contains those same consonants (/m/, /l/) in addition to some vowels (e.g., /u/, /r/). Although they differ significantly phonetically due to their distinct vowel patterns ("eye"-like sound vs. long-vowel combination), both share common consonantal sounds of /s/, /d/l
coiner, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "coined" has the sound /nɛndʒ/ (the letter combination "-ned-" followed by the voiced postalveolar fricative "/d͡ʒ/" or "soft g"), whereas in the name "Barrinéau", we find the sound /bærəˈnuː/. Although they differ, both contain similar consonantal patterns ("-r-", "-nn", and final silent letters), which suggests
horse, haris, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is as follows:* The word "horse" has the consonant sound /rs/.* The word "haris" also starts with the same consonant sound /hr/, which can be considered similar to or equivalent to /rs/.However, despite having identical consonant sounds (/r/) in both words, they differ significantly in their vowel sounds: "orse" (in "horse") vs. "a-r-is" (in "haris"). This difference justifies
summerlin, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "summerlin" has the consonants /m/, /r**, **l**n, while the word "jemmie" also contains the same set of consonants (/j/, /m**, **l**i). Although they differ in their starting letters (the first letter is's' for one and 'j' for another), both words share similar sets of consonant phonemes ('rr', 'll'). However, they vary significantly with respect to
sowder, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowder" has the consonants /swd/, while the word "Zeolite" (not "Zoeli") has the consonants /zl/. Although they differ, both contain the same sound of voiced dental fricative (/z/) followed by distinct vowels ("ower" in "sowder", and "oi" or long e(/iː) in Zeolite). This meets the criteria for having similar consonant sounds
shelley, postdating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shelley" has the letter combination /ʃɛli/, where "/ˈʃ/" is a voiceless postalveolar fricative (a soft sh sound) followed by the vowels "/e/" and "/i/", which form a diphthong (/ɛ/) with a slight transition between them.On the other hand, the suffix "-posting-" in "postdating" can be broken down into its constituent parts: "/pəs
pasta, pistor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "p", "s" and "t" in both words ("pasta" and "pistor") represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes (/p/, /s/, and /t/) respectively, whereas their corresponding vowels differ: "/a/" vs "/ɪ/" (or sometimes pronounced as "/i/") for "past-" and "-tor". The difference lies solely with the distinct vocalic components of each word's pronunciation, while maintaining similarity among
loynd, lindy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "loynd" has the consonants /l/, /n/', and /d', while the word "Lindy" also starts with the same consonant sound "/ldi/" (note: Lindy's first syllable can be pronounced as either /li:/ or /ɪnda/, depending on regional accents, but both pronunciations retain the similar consonant sequence). The difference lies in their vowels; "loyd" typically ends with the d
sader, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sader" has the consonants /d/, /r/. On the other hand, the word "litigating" also contains the same consonants (/t/) followed by another set of vowels which form distinct sound patterns. Hence they share similar yet not exactly matching consonantal phonemes while having dissimilar vocalic components in their pronunciation. This distinction is evident despite both being English language terms with varied meanings.<|eot_id|>
schuller, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification:The word "schuler" contains the sound /ʃ/ (a voiceless postalveolar fricative) as its initial consonantal phoneme, while "Kisling" starts with the sound /k/. These two sounds do not share any similarities in terms of their place or manner of articulation, which means they can't be considered identical.On the other hand, both words contain distinct vowels: "/u/" in "Schüler" vs. no
nader, indy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "nader" has the consonants /dər/, whereas the word "indy" has the consonants /ndi/. Although they differ in their vowels (/ɑːʳ vs i), both contain the same consonantal sound, which is represented by the letters 'D' or 'N'. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do share identical consonant sounds despite having distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
dad, dowdy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dad" has the /d/ sound as its initial consonant, while "downy" also starts with the same /n/ (not /d/) followed by a different set of vowels ("ou"). Although they share no common consonants other than their starting letters (/d/ vs./dn/, respectively), both words start with distinct phonemes that differ from each other in terms of place or manner of articulation. Hence, I conclude that yes,
oops, pisa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "oops" has the sound /ps/, which is also present in the word "pisa". The only difference between them is their vowels, with "o"s replaced by "i"s. Therefore, they share similar consonant sounds (the /ps/) but differ in their vowel sounds (/ɒʊs vs iˈsa/.).<|eot_id|>
cod, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cod" has the consonant sound /k/, while "coder" also starts with the same consonant sound /k/. However, they differ in their following vowels - "od" vs. "-oer". This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (both /k/) but distinct vowel sounds (/ɒd/ vs. /ʊər/).<|eot_id|>
cent, serranto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cent" and "serrano" do not share the same ending sound, which is what I initially thought when looking at them. However, upon closer inspection, we can see that they both end with the /nt/ or /rɑnoʊt/ combination of letters, respectively. This means that despite having distinct vowels in each word ("ent" vs. "er"), their consonants (/n/, /t/) remain unchanged, making
szalay, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "szalay" has the sound /z/, which is also present in the word "gettin'", along with other distinct letters that do not share similar phonetic values, such as "g", "t". However, both words contain vowels ("a" and "i") whose pronunciation differs from each other (e.g., open front unrounded vs close near-front rounded). Therefore, while they don't match exactly on all fronts, their consonants exhibit
shelor, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "sh" in both "shelor" and "easel" represent the same sound, which is /ʃ/. The vowels following them also differ: "or" in "shelor" vs. "ea" in "easel". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (the "sh") with different vowel sounds ("o-r" versus "a-e").<|eot_id|>
liebe, allbee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "liebe" and "allbee" share the same consonants ("l", "b"), which means they have identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ - "i" in "liebe" versus double "a"s in "allbee". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
immerse, miesse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "m", "r", "s" in both words ("immerse" and "mimese") share similar or identical consonant phonemes (/m/, /r/, /z/) respectively, whereas their vowels differ: "/ɪ/" (short i) in "immerse" vs "/aɪ/" (long ai) in "mimese". This meets the criteria of having distinct yet matching consonants with varying vowel patterns
ebright, berti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The two-word pair "ebright" and "berti" share the same consonants ("b", "r", "t"), which indicates that they may have similar or even identical sound patterns for those letters. However, their vowels differ in both cases:* In "ebright," there is one long open mid front unrounded vowel (/ɛ/) followed by another short close back rounded vowel (/ʌ/)* Meanwhile, in "berti," we find three
luck, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "luck" has the consonants /l/, /k/, and /ck/. The second set of letters, "/j-", is actually part of the digraph combination "/jj", which represents the sound /dʒ/.On the other hand, the name "Jimmie" starts with the letter sequence "/JJ-". In this case, both instances of '/J/' represent distinct phonemes: one as a voiced postalveolar affricate (/dʒ
sinatra, santoro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sinatra" has the consonant sound /trɑːrə/ (the letter combination 'tra' pronounced with a diphthong), while the word "santoro" also has this same consonant sound (/tʊroʊ/, where '/u/' is not phonetically distinct from '/a:/'). However, they differ in their respective vowels: "/i/" for "sinatra", versus "/o/" or possibly open-mid
gokey, gocke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "k" in both "gokey" and "gocke" appear to share similar or identical consonant sound, which is /k/. However, their corresponding vowels differ: "o" (in "go") vs. "oe". The presence of distinct vowel phonemes (/ɔː/ for "o", /i:/ for "oe"), despite having matching consonants, satisfies the condition specified by your question.<|eot_id|>
scholl, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "sch" in both "school" and "priem" (not "praim", I assume you meant to type "prim") represent the same /ʃ/ sound, which is a voiceless postalveolar fricative or a palato-alveolar fricative depending on language accent. This means they share the same consonantal phoneme. However, their vowels differ: "/o/" vs "/ɪi"/.
chalet, petrelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:In the word "chalet", there is no distinct consonant sound, as 'c' and 'h' form a cluster with a soft pronunciation (the voiceless palatal fricative /tʃ/). The next letter 'l', followed by another silent or very softly pronounced letter combination ('e't), doesn't change this conclusion.On the other hand, in the word "petrelli" we can identify three separate consonants: P-T
olack, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "olack" has the letter combination "-lack", which represents the /læk/ sound, where both letters ("L" and "K") make up part of this distinct consonantal phoneme. Similarly, in the second half of your question, "smullen" also contains the same sequence "/mʊnəld/" with similar consonants (/M/, /N/) forming one unit. However, what sets them apart is that they differ only
keehner, aken, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "keener" and "akeren" do not exist in the English language, so I'll assume you meant to type or provide actual words that start with those spellings. However, for argument's sake, let's consider two real words:1. Keen (pronounced /kiːn/)2. Aken (a rare surname pronounced as /eɪkən/, meaning from Akhen)In this case, both words share
fires, phase, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "fires" and "phase" do not share the same ending sound, which is what I would typically consider when evaluating whether two words have identical consonant sounds or not. However, if we focus on their initial consonants only ("fr-" vs. "-ph-"), they can indeed be considered as having similar (but distinct) consonant sounds (/f/ vs. /p/) followed by differing vowels (-ies/-ase). Therefore, my response to this
schuele, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuelle" has the consonants /ch/, /u**, and /l**/. On the other hand, the word "herrónimo" also contains similar consonant sounds of /r**, /n**, and /m**/** (note that ** represents no audible sound). Although they differ in their initial letters (/s/ vs./H/) which would normally affect pronunciation, when considering only the remaining consonant sequences within each word, we can
rea, irey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "rea-" in the phrase "reality" has the consonant sound /r/, while the word "irey" (which is likely referring to Ireland) also starts with the same consonant sound "/r/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "ea" vs. "i". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (/r/) but distinct vowel sounds ("ea" ≠ "i").<|eot_id|>
boat's, bettis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "boat" ends with the sound /t/, which is also present in the surname "Bettis". Additionally, both words end with the same suffix "-s", indicating that they share similar consonantal endings. However, their vowels differ; "boat" has a long "o" (ō) while "bettis" contains two distinct vowel sounds ("e" followed by another short "i"). This combination of shared consonants and differing vowels meets the criteria
aleshire, lesharo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "a" and "" both represent the same sound /əl/, which is a schwa followed by L, whereas the letter combination "-shire-" in "aleshire" represents the sound /ʃɪr/", with /s/ being a voiceless alveolar fricative and /i/ being a close front unrounded vowel. On the other hand, the word "lesharo" has the sound "/ˈli
kenney, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenney" has the consonants /n/, /k/, and silent 'y', while the word "jamb" also contains the same consonants (/m/) in addition to its own distinct vowels ("a"). Since both share common consonantal phonemes, they meet this condition of having identical consonant sounds despite differing vocalic components. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed possess similar consonance with varying vocality.<|eot_id|>
amoruso, miesse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "amorous" has the sound /mərʊs/ (with the letter combination'mor' forming the sound), whereas the word "messy" has the sound /miːsi/. Although they differ in their vowels, both words share the same consonantal sequence '/ms/', which makes them match on this criterion of having similar consonant sounds despite differing vowels.<|eot_id|>
bossi, bice, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "boss" has the sound /s/, which appears in both instances, while the vowels differ: "/o/" (in "boss") vs. "/ī/" or "/ɪtʃ/" (depending on pronunciation) in "bice". The presence of distinct vowel phonemes (/o/ ≠ /ī/) distinguishes them despite sharing similar consonantal features (/s/). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds
became, bachmeier, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "became" ends with the /m/ sound, which is also present in the surname "Bachmeier". However, they differ in their final vowels (/e/ vs./iɛr/, respectively). This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (the /b/, /c/, /m/) but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
leaps, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "p" in both "leaps" and "lips" represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes, which means they produce the same sound when pronounced (the voiceless bilabial stop /p/. However, the vowels preceding them differ: "ea"s in "leaps" versus "i" in "lips". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
kelker, kloc, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "k" in both "kelker" and "kloc" represent the same consonantal sound, which is /k/. However, the vowels preceding this consonant differ: "el-" (in "kelker") has a distinct phonetic quality compared to "o-" (in "kloc"). This difference justifies my initial affirmative response. The presence of distinctive vowel sounds before the shared consonant supports the notion that they do not possess identical conson
imes, mays', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "imes" has the sound /mɪz/, while the word "mays" has the sound /meɪz/. Although they share the same consonants ("ms"), their vowels differ, with "/i/" in "imes" versus "/a/" (or more precisely, schwa-like pronunciation) in "mays". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
patrol, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "patrol" has the consonants /t/, /r/, and /l/, while the word "litigating" also contains those same consonants: /t/, /r/, and /l/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds ("a" vs. various vowels such as "i", "e", or others). The presence of distinct vowel phonemes distinguishes them despite sharing common consonantal components.<|eot_id|>
sheley, gemmer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sheley" and "gemmer" both contain the same set of consonants (/sh/, /l/, /m/) which indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ - "/e/" in "sheley" is distinct from "/e/" (or possibly "/i"/) in "gemmer". Therefore, I conclude that despite having some differences in spelling, these two words exhibit identical consonant sounds with differing vowel
petrilli, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:In the word "petrilli", we find the consonants /t/, /r/, /l/, and /l/. In the same manner, in the word "kanner", there exist similar consonants: /n/, /n/, /r/.However, when considering their vowels ("e" vs. "a"), they differ from one another despite having matching consonantal parts. Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed, both sets of words
shiller, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shiller" has the consonants /s/, /h*/, /l*/ and /r*, while the word "Koehn" (note: I assume you meant to type "Koehnen", as Koehn typically refers to someone with this surname, whereas Köhn means something else) has the consonants /k*/*, /e*/, /n*. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/i/ vs /oe
liebe, laborer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "liebe" has the letter combination "-ibe-" which represents the sound /iːbə/, whereas in the English pronunciation of "laborer", the corresponding syllable would typically pronounce as "/leɪber/", with a distinct difference between their vowel sounds (/eɪ/ vs./i:/). However, both pronunciations share similar consonantal sounds: /lb/. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (in
argent, reagent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "argent" has the consonant sound /rɛnt/ (the combination of 'r' and 't') whereas "reagent" also starts with the same sequence of consonants, namely "/riˈeɪn(t)/". Although they differ in their vowels (/ent/ vs./aɪn(t)/), both share similar initial consonantal phonemes making them semantically equivalent as regards to consonant pronunciation. The difference lies solely within the
kin, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kin" has the /k/ sound, which is also present in the word "jama". The only difference between them is their vowels: "in" vs. "a-m-a", respectively. Therefore, they share the same consonantal phoneme (/k/) but differ in their vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
bruner, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "bruner" has the consonants /b/, /r/, /n/, and /r*/, while the word "jaimie" also contains the same set of consonants (/b/, /m/, /i**, and /e*). The only difference between the two sets of letters lies in their vowels: "runner" ends with "/r/" (a diphthong) whereas "Jaimie" concludes with "/i
nun, nanni, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nun" has the consonants /n/ and /n/, which are identical, while its vowels are short 'u' (or sometimes silent). On the other hand, the word "manni" also starts with two consecutive instances of the same consonant sound "/n/", followed by distinct vowel sounds ("a" in both cases). Therefore, they share similar consonantal characteristics despite having differing vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
ikon, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "ikon" has the letter combination "/kɒn/", which contains only one consonantal sound /kn/.* Similarly, the word "boren" also has the letter combination "/brən", containing again only one consonantal sound /bn/.Although both combinations appear to contain similar letters (e.g., 'K' in "ikon" resembles 'B' in "boren"), they represent distinct phonetic units with separate meanings
risner, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "riser" has the consonants /r/, /s*/, and /r*/ (the last one is silent), while the word "primo" also contains the same set of consonants (/p/, /r*, and no other visible *). However, they differ in their vowels ("i", "e") which makes them distinct phonetically despite sharing similar consonantal patterns.<|eot_id|>
dawes, owades, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "d", "w" and "s" in both "Daws-" and "-Owades" represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes (/d/, /w/, and /z/) respectively, while their accompanying vowels "/a/" and "/o"/ differ from each other. This means they share some similarities at the consonant level (identical), yet vary distinctly at the vowel level (different).<|eot_id|>
zeal, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zeal" has the consonants /z/, /e*/, and /l*, while the name "O'Brian" (or Obryan) typically starts with the consonants /b*/*r*. Since they don't share any matching consonant phonemes, I would argue that their initial consonant sounds aren't identical.However, both words end in distinctively similar consonantal combinations: *el* for "zeal", and *n*/ or */an
acid, aachener, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "acid" has the consonants /c-d-/, while the German city name "Aachen" (pronounced as "AH-hen") also starts with the same sequence of consonants "/a-ch-n/. Although they differ in their vowel sound, specifically /ɪ/ vs./əˈhʏnər/ respectively), the initial consonant cluster is shared between both words, making them similar yet distinct phonetically.<|eot_id|>
murdaugh, emde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "murdaugh" has the sound /drɡ/ (the letter combination "ur") in its consonants, while the word "emde" also contains this same consonantal sound (/md/) with slightly differing vowels ("e"). The justification for my response is that despite having distinct vocalic components, both words share similar phonetic characteristics within their respective consonatal clusters, specifically involving the presence of voiced stops followed by nasalized or approximative transitions to other segments
seader, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seader" has the consonants /s/, /d/, and /r/. Similarly, the word "encase" also contains the same set of consonants (/n/, not considered in this context as we're looking for similar consonantal patterns). However, their vowels differ; "seader" ends with "/er/" while "encase" concludes with "/eɪzəʳ". This suggests that both words share the same pattern of
side, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" has the same consonants as "bar", which is 'd' and 'r'. However, they differ in their vowels; "ide" (in "side") versus ""ar"" (in "bar"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
howerton, huttner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "howerton" has the sound /h/, /w/, /r/, /t*/, and /n/. The word "huttnur" (corrected spelling of "Huttner") also starts with the same initial sound "/h/", then followed by "/t", which is similar to */t*/ in "Howerton". However, they differ in their final consonants (/rn vs /nr/) as well as having distinct vowels throughout each word ("ow"
plies, apple's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "plies" has the consonants /p/, /l*/, and /s*, while the word "apple"s (note: I assume you meant to say "apples", as there is no possessive form of apple) also contains those same consonants (/p/, /l**, and /z*). The difference lies in their vowels, where "plies" ends with "/iz/" and "apples" ends with "/ɪlz/. Since
astley, settle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "astley" has the consonants /stl/, while the word "settle" also contains those same consonants (/stl/). The only difference is in their vowels, with "astley" having /æ/ (the 'a' sound) and "settle" having /ɛt/. Since they share the same consonantal sequence but differ in their vocalic parts, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed possess identical consonant sounds
shiller, homann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shiller" has the consonants /ʃ/, /l/, and /r*/, while the word "homann" also contains the same consonant sound combination, i.e., /h$/, /m$, and /n$/. The only difference between them lies in their respective vowels: "/i/" vs "./o/", which indicates distinct phonetic properties despite sharing similar consonantal patterns.<|eot_id|>
paonessa, ponce, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "paonessa" has the consonants /p/, /n**, and **ss** (which is often pronounced as one sound), while the word "ponce" also contains the same set of consonants (/pnce/) with similar pronunciations, differing only in their respective vowels ("a", "o"). This suggests that they share common consonantal features despite having distinct vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
keener, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "keen" has the sound /kɛn/, which starts with the consonants "/k/" (the voiceless velar plosive) and ends with the vowels "/e/" and "/n/", whereas the word "brawn-y" or more specifically, its pronunciation as /bræni/ in British English, also begins with the same consonantal sequence "/br/" (which includes the voiced labiodental fricative "/" and
shelor, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "sh" and "z" represent the same sound in both cases, which is the voiced interdental fricative /ʒ/. This means that they share the same consonantal phoneme (the smallest unit of speech). On the other hand, the vowels "e", "o" in "shelor" and "e", "e" in "zele" differ from each other as well ("oh"-like vs. "
alleva, leever, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "alv" in both "alleva-" and "-leever" represent similar or identical consonant phonemes /l/, /v/. The difference lies only in their accompanying vowels, which change from "e", "a" to just one "ee". This indicates they share common consonantal sound(s) despite varying vocalic parts.<|eot_id|>
o'kane, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "o'Kane" has the consonants / Kane/, which include the sound "/k/" (the voiceless velar plosive) and no other distinct consonantal phonemes.On the other hand, the word "Bowron" also contains the consonants /rwn/. The first two letters '/b/' represent another instance of the voiced bilabial stop, while 'w', being silent in this context, doesn't contribute to the overall consonance pattern
loco, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "loco" has the consonant sound /k/, while the word "Summerlin" also starts with the same consonant sound /l/. The only difference is in their vowels: "oco" (short 'o') vs. no distinct vowel sound at all ("mmer"). Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (/lk/) despite having different vowel combinations.<|eot_id|>
schoeller, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schoeller" has the consonants /sch/, /l/, and /r/. The second part of the compound surname, "barrineau", also contains similar consonant combinations: /br/, /n/, and /u/.Although they share some similarities in their consonantal structure, I consider them to have distinct consonant sounds due to differences in phonetic pronunciation:* In "schoeller", the sound is more like [ʃ] (a
cuccio, kutch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cuccio" and "kutsch" (or more commonly spelled as "Kutcho") both contain the same set of consonants (/kk/, /tʃ/) which sound alike, whereas their vowels differ ("u", "o" in "cuccio" vs no distinct vowel sound or "u" in some dialects' pronunciation of "ku-tch"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.
streep, strip, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "streep" and "strip" share the same consonants ("trp"), which means they have identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ: "e" in "streep" versus "" (short i) or sometimes "i" as in some accents of English in "strip". Therefore, while not exact phonetic twins, they do meet the criteria specified for having similar yet distinct properties.<|eot_id|>
schul, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schul" has the sound /ʃuːl/, where "/s/" is a voiceless alveolar fricative, "/h/" is a voiced glottal transition (in this case, not pronounced), and "/l/" is an alveolar lateral approximant. The same applies to the word "zelle", which also contains the sequence of sounds /ʒɛl/.Although they differ in their initial consonants (/š
rayson, rosano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "rayson" and "Rosano" differ only in their vowels, with the first word having 'ay' as its vowel sound (longer than one syllable) and the second word having 'o' as its vowel sound (short). Meanwhile, both words share similar consonants ("rsn"), which remain unchanged between them. This suggests that they do indeed possess identical consonant sounds despite differing in their vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
tokio, attica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tokio" has the consonants /t/, /k/, and /o/ while the word "Attica" also contains the same set of consonants (/t/, /k/) with distinct vowels, which are "/a/" in Attica versus no-vowel sound ("o") in Tokio (the 'i' in Tokyo represents a long i-sound). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds between two
cannes, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "cannes" has the letter combination /kæn/, where "/k/" represents the voiceless velar stop, "/ɑ/" represents the open back unrounded vowel, and "/n/" represents the alveolar nasal continuant.On the other hand, the word "smullen" (although not commonly used) also contains the same sequence of letters: /s/", "/m/", "/", and "". The only difference lies in their pronunciation:
brussels, barcellos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "br" in both words form identical consonant sounds, which are /bɹ/. The vowels following each set of consonants differ: "u"s (as in Brussels) versus "o"s or "e"s (in Barcéllo[s]). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds between two sets of syllables.<|eot_id|>
healthy, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "healthy" has the consonants /h/, /l/, /t/, and /y/. On the other hand, the word "brony" also contains the same set of consonants (/b/, /r/, /n/, and /y/) in that order. This means they share similar or even identical consonant sounds (e.g., both "/t/" and "/y/" appear only once). However, their vowels differ; "health-y"
floats, felts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "floats" has the consonants /f/, /l*/, and /t*/ (the asterisk indicates voiceless stops), while the word "felts" also contains those same consonants: /f/, /l*, and /t*. The difference lies in their vowels, where "floats" ends with /ɔːz/ (/oʊz/) whereas "felt"s end with /əlz/. Since both sets of
oecd, shelly, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "oeced" has no actual existence, as it's not a valid English word. However, if we consider the correct spelling of the word to be "occed", which means having occurred or happened (although this usage seems rare), then comparing it with the word "shelley", we can see that they do share similar consonant sounds (/k/) in their pronunciation. The main difference lies in their respective vowels: /ɒʃə
healthy, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "healthy" has the consonants /h/, /l/, /t/, and /y/. The word "Arsenault" (I assume that's how you intended to spell Arsèneau) also has those same consonants: /r/, /s**,n**,lt**/.However, they differ in their vowel sounds:* In "healthy", there is no vowel sound.* In "Arsenault", we find **e**, then **a**, followed
royer, irey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "royer" has the consonants /r/, /o*/, and /r*/ (the asterisks represent the pronunciation), while the word "irey" also has the same consonants: /i/*, //, /*/. The difference lies in their respective vowels: "/o/" vs "/i/", which results in distinct pronunciations for each word despite sharing similar consonantal sequences.<|eot_id|>
shill, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shill" starts with the /ʃ/ sound, which is also present in the word "shell". Both words end with distinct vowels (/ɪl/) and (/ən/), respectively). Therefore, they share similar consonantal phonemes (the voiceless postalveolar fricative) while having differing vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
amoruso, immerse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "m", "r" and "s" in both words ("amorous-o" and "-immerse") represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes (/ˈæməruːsaʊ/ vs /ɪˈmɜːrs/) while having distinct vowels: long "u" sound (ou) versus short, open mid-central vowel sound (). The difference lies solely between their vowel segments, not among the shared
alloys, eilers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "l" in both "alloys" and "eilers" represent the same sound, which is /ɛl/. This means they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/ən/) despite having distinct vowels: "/oʊ/" (in "alloy") versus "/aɪ/" (in "Eiler").<|eot_id|>
huguet, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "huguet" and "Geiger" (not Geitner, I assume there was a typo) both contain the same consonant sound /g/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "u" in "huguet" versus "ei" or sometimes pronounced as "/aɪ/" in "Geiger". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between two words.<|eot_id|>
acid, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "acid" has the consonant sound /c/, while the word "noxso" also contains the same consonant sound (/ks/) followed by another consonant sound (/s/. Although they differ in their vowel sounds, which is "/i/" for "acid" and no distinct vowels present in "noxso", both sets of consonants share similar phonetic properties making them alike to some extent. This similarity can lead us to conclude that yes, there exist
highman, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "high" has the consonants /h/, /i/, and /m/. In contrast, the word "rasper" (I assume that's what you meant by "rasner") also starts with the same sequence of consonants (/r/, /s/, /p/, /r/) followed by distinct vowels ("a", "e"). This indicates they share similar or identical consonant sounds but differ in their respective vowel patterns. Therefore, I conclude that
locally, leclere, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "locally" has the letter combination "-ly", which represents a single /l/ sound, while the surname "LeClère" also contains this same sequence of letters with the exact same phonetic value (/l/) as its consonants (the double-L is silent). The difference lies in their vowels: "o" vs. "e". Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (-ly/L) despite having distinct vowel sounds ("o"/"e").<|eot_id|>
cede, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cede" has the sound /sɛd/, where "/c/" is pronounced as a soft voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by the diphthong "/eɪ/", which then transitions into the voiced dental stop consonantal sound "/d/.On the other hand, the word "jammer" has the sound /ˈdʒæmər/, where "/j'" is pronounced as a palatal approximant
contusion, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "contusion" has the sound /ntʃənˈsɪʒən/ (NUN-shuh-nih-zhun) with the same consonants (/t/, /n/, /ch/) as in "brawny", which is pronounced as /brɔni/ (BRAH-nee). The only difference lies in their vowels, where "contusion" starts with "/k/" followed by "u" while
schul, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two sets of letters "sch" in both "Schul-" and "-Hermann" represent the same sound, which is /ʃ/. The voiceless postalveolar fricative, to be precise! This means that they share similar or identical consonant sounds.On the other hand, the vowels preceding them differ: "u" (in "Schul") vs. "e" (in "-Hermann"). These distinct vowel phonemes distinguish between their respective meanings.
peko, apec, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "peko" and "apec" do indeed share the same consonant sound, which is /p/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds - "e" (in "peko") versus "" (in "apec"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
zulli, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two sets of letters "zuli" and "-oconnor" both contain the same consonants: /l/, /n/, and /r/. However, they differ in their vowels (/uːɪ/) vs./əʊkənɔr̩/). The presence or absence of specific vowel phonemes distinguishes them from one another despite sharing common consonantal components.<|eot_id|>
ares, ours, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ares" ends with the sound /rs/, which is the same as the ending of the word "ours". However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "are"s has a long 'a' (ɑː) while "our's" has a short 'oʊ'. This meets the condition specified by your question.<|eot_id|>
highman, gitano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "high" has the consonants /h/, /g/, and /m/.* The word "gitano" also contains the same sequence of consonants: /g/, /t*/, and /n/.Although they share similar sequences, there's no exact match in their pronunciation due to differences in regional accents or dialects. However, phonetically speaking, both sets contain the same combination of consonantal letters (/hgmn/) with distinct
breighner, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "breignher" has the letter combination "-rgh-" which represents the /ɹːʁ/ sound, while in the word "jama", there is no similar consonant sound present to compare with. Therefore, I conclude that they do not share identical consonant sounds. However, if we consider only the initial letters of each word ("br" vs. "ja"), then both contain distinct vowel sounds (the short 'e' in
loynd, lundy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two sets of letters, "loynd" and "lundy", share the same consonants ("lyd"), which is /ld/. However, they differ in their vowels: "oy" (in "loyd") vs. "un" or sometimes "u" alone (as in "lund"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
guyton, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guy-ton" has the consonant sound /t/, whereas the word "ze-al" also contains the same consonant sound /l/. Although they appear differently, both letters represent the same voiceless alveolar stop or lateral approximant in English phonetics. This means that despite having distinct vowels ("u", "i" vs. "e"), their corresponding consonants share similar pronunciation, making them semantically equivalent for this purpose.<|eot_id|>
breiner, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "brein" in "Breiner" has the sound /br/, which is similar to the corresponding part of the word "jam". However, they differ in their vowels; "rein" ends with the diphthong "/aɪ/" while "jam" has a single short vowel "/æ/. This satisfies the condition that both words share identical consonants ("r", "b") but distinct vowel sounds (/aɪ/ vs /æ
osler, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "s" in both "osler" and "ozelle" represent the same sound, which is /z/. Similarly, the letter combinations "-er" in "osler" and "-ell-" in "ozelle" also share similar consonantal properties (alveolar stop). However, their vowels differ; "o" in "osler" has a distinct pronunciation (/ɒ/) whereas "oze"- prefix in "ozelle" typically carries a
jobber, gebbia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "jobber" has the consonant sound /b/, while "gebbia" also contains this same consonant sound (/b/) in its spelling, indicating that they share similar or identical consonant phonemes (sounds). However, their vowels differ; "ob-" is pronounced as [oʊ] with a long 'o' sound in "jobber", whereas in "gebbia," there's no such diphthonged vowel combination
tyree, tor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "tyree" and "tor" both contain the /tr/ sound, which is their identical consonant part. However, they differ in their vowels - "ee" in "tyree" versus no vowel ("o") in "tor". Therefore, according to phonetic analysis, we can conclude that indeed, the two words share identical consonant sounds (the /tr/) but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
return, orton, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "return" has the consonants /r/, /t/, /n/ (identical to the same letters in the other direction), whereas "orton" also contains those exact same consonants (/rt'n/) although they appear at opposite ends of each syllable, with intervening vowels ("er", "on"). The only difference is that their corresponding vowel combinations differ: "/ərn/" vs "/ɔtn/", which means they do not share any matching vowel phonemes despite
game, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "game" has the consonants /g/, /m/, and /e/. Meanwhile, the word "germe" also contains the same set of consonants (/g/, /m/) followed by distinct vowels (/er/me). This indicates that both words share similar consonantal patterns while differing in their respective vocalic components. Therefore, I conclude that they indeed possess identical consonant sounds (the sequence "/gm/") with varying vowel sounds ("ae" vs.
seader, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the two sets of letters "se" in "seader" and "kaine" both contain the same consonant sound /s/, which means they share similar phonetic properties, specifically their manner (fricative) and place (alveolar). However, since "e" has a distinct pronunciation (/ɛ/) compared to "a" (/eil), we can conclude that despite having the same consonants ("se"), the overall syllable
cod, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cod" has the same consonantal sound /kɑd/, whereas the suffix "-or-" also represents similar consonantal sounds, specifically /r/. However, in terms of vowels, we see that there is no similarity between them; "o" (in "cod") versus "" (the diphthong or digraph representing two distinct vowel phonemes). This satisfies our condition for having both identical consonant sounds ("c", then "r"),
leaky, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "leaky" has the consonants /l/, /k/, and /y", whereas the word "gemme" (note: gemme means "gems" in French, not to be confused with Gemma) also contains the same set of consonants (/g/, /m/, and /m"). The only difference lies in their respective vowels, which are "/eɪ/" for "leaky" and "/" or "/iː/"
locher, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "locher" has the consonants /l/, /k/, /r/ (and possibly others), while the word "castings" also contains those same consonants (/s/ is not part of this analysis, as we're comparing individual phonemes). The difference lies in their vowels: "o" in "locher" versus "a", "i", or other possible combinations ("c-a-s-t-i-n-g-s") in "castings".Since both
ashley, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the words "ashley" and "Arsenault" (I assume you meant to type Arsenneau) both contain similar consonantal sounds, specifically /shl/, which remain unchanged despite having distinct vowels (/ey/ vs./eu/). The difference lies in their vowel combinations, with "/ey/" appearing in "Ashley" versus "/u/" or possibly even "/ou/" depending on regional pronunciations of French names like Aresne
keeney, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "keeney" has the sound /kɛnˈi/ (ken-EYE), while the word "bran" has the sound /bræn/. Although they differ in their vowels (/e/ vs. /a/), both words share similar consonantal sounds, specifically /kn/, which is pronounced similarly in both cases as /kən/. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
gumm, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gum" has the same consonant sound /m/, while "zeal" also contains the same consonant sound /z/. However, their vowels differ - "u" in "gum" versus "ea" in "zeal". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (both contain either/m/or/z/) with differing vowel sounds (/u/ vs./ea/).<|eot_id|>
cede, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cede" has the sound /sɛd/, where "/c/" is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar stop, followed by the vowels "/e/" (a close-mid front unrounded vowel) and "/d/" (the voiced dental plosive).On the other hand, the name "O'Bryen" can be broken down into its individual parts: "Ob-" with the sound /oʊb/, which consists of the diph
dolley, dehler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the first word "dolley" has the sound /l/ in its consonants, whereas the second word "dehler" also contains the same consonantal sound "/l/. However, their vowels differ: "o" vs. "e". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (both contain '/l/') but distinct vowel sounds (/o/ ≠ /e/).<|eot_id|>
milone, millennia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "milone" has the letter combination "-l-" (consonants) followed by the vowels "-o". The word "millennia", on the other hand, also starts with the same consonantal sound "-ll-" (a double-L), which is pronounced similarly to single-L in most languages, including English. However, while both words share this similar consonatal pattern, their final parts differ: "-ne" for "milone" versus "-nia" for "
game, girten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "game" has the sound /gæm/, where "g" represents a voiceless velar stop, "a" is pronounced as a monophthong near-open front unrounded vowel (/æ/) in American English or close back rounded vowel (/ɑː/) in British English), and finally "me" denotes a nasalized diphthong (/"mi"/).On the other hand, the word "geraten" starts with
koehn, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "koen" has the same consonants ("k", "e") as in "prom". The only difference between them lies in their vowels, with "o" replacing the first "e" in "Koen". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
alcoa's, keeny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "alcoa" has the letter combination /kl/, which represents the sound of two distinct consonants: 'k' (voiceless velar stop) followed by 'l'. Meanwhile, in the word "Keen", we find the single consonantal phoneme /n/. Although they appear to differ visually due to their position within each word, both instances represent the same voiceless nasal constant sound (/n/) whereas the first part ("alk") doesn
curd, kid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "curd" ends with the sound /rd/, which is represented by the letters 'r' and 'd'. The word "kid", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound /rd/. Although they share similar ending sounds (/rd/) in both words, their initial vowels differ: "/ur/" (in "curd") vs. "/i/" (in "kid"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed contain identical consonant
schmehl, shimel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "schmehl" has the letter combination "/sm/" which represents a distinct consonantal sound, while in the word "shimel", we find another instance of this same sound pattern "/shm/'. Although they appear differently due to diacritical marks (ü vs i), both instances represent the same phoneme (/ʃ/) - a voiceless postalveolar fricative or interdental sibilant. On the other hand, their vowels
scholey, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholey" has the consonant sound /ʃ/, which is also present in the word "Reis-son". However, they differ in their vowels; "o" appears in "scholey", while "e" or sometimes "ee" appear in various pronunciations of "reison"/"reiason". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /ʃ/) with different vowel sounds between
megill, module, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the first word "megill" has the sound /gɪl/ (the letter combination "mg") followed by the vowel sound /iː/, whereas in the second word "module", there's also the same consonant sound /mʌdjuəl/ with a different vowel sound (/u/) and diphthongal ending (-le). The only difference being the presence of additional letters like "-du-" which doesn't
shelly, game, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelly" has the consonant sound /l/, while the word "game" also starts with the same consonant sound /g/. Although they differ in their initial consonants, both end with distinct vowels (/y/ for "shelly", and /eɪm/ for "game"). This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (in this case, not exactly alike due to being from different positions) but differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
ashley, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ashley" has the consonant sound /sh/, while the word "Hermann" also starts with the same consonant sound /h/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "ashley" ends with the vowels "/e/" (long e) whereas "Hermann" ends with the vowels "/ɛrma/" (/er-mah). Although both contain distinct combinations of letters representing unique phonetic representations, the presence of differing vowel patterns
americus, marcos', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "americus" has the consonants /m/, /r**, and **c**s, while the word "marcos" has the consonants /m/, /r*, and *cs*. Despite having different vowels (/i*/ in "america"s vs. */a*/* or */o*/* in "Marcoss"), they share similar consonantal sound patterns: [ˈæmɛɹɪkəs] (with slightly
gekko, gocke, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "gekko" has the consonants /g/, /k/, and /o/, whereas the word "gocke" also contains those same consonants (/g/, /k/) with slightly differing vowels, specifically "/ɛ/" in place of "/o/") as pronounced differently by English speakers. The difference lies mainly within their pronunciation due to varying accents or regional speech patterns rather than any significant changes to letter representations themselves (as both letters '
gotten, keeny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gotten" ends with the sound /nʔt/, while "Keeney" ends with the sound /ni/. Although they share similar letters, such as 'k', 'e', and 'y' in both words, their phonetic pronunciations differ due to distinct vowels used: open front unrounded vowel (ɛ) in "got-tin'" vs close near-back rounded vowel (/i/) in Keen-y". The presence of two different
burdell, badal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "burdell" starts with the /b/ sound, which is a voiceless bilabial stop.* It also contains the /r/, /d/, and/or /l/ sounds in between vowels or at the end of the syllable (depending on how one pronounces this uncommon surname).* On the other hand, the word "badal" has the same initial /b/ sound followed by the /a/ d
alco, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "alco" has the consonant sound /k/, while the word "jemmie" also starts with the same consonant sound /j/. The only difference is in their respective vowels, where "alco" ends with the vowel sound /o/ whereas "jemmie" ends with the diphthong /iɛm/. Therefore, they share similar consonantal features but differ in terms of vocalic components, justifying my initial affirmative response: yes.
soady, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "s", "d" and "l" in both words ("soady" and "zeal") represent identical consonant sounds, whereas the vowels differ: "o-a-y" vs. "e". The presence of distinct vowel phonemes (sounds) despite shared consonants meets the condition specified by your question.<|eot_id|>
bleck, bilk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c" in both "bleck" and "bilk" represent the same sound /k/, which means they share the same consonant sound. The vowels, however, differ: "e" (in "bleck") has a distinct phonetic value compared to "i" (in "bilk"). Therefore, while sharing similar consonants ("-eck-" vs "-il-", respectively), their respective vowel sounds distinguish them from having truly identical conson
fires, fuzz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fires" ends with the sound /z/, which is also present in the word "fizz". Both words share this similar ending, indicating that they contain identical consonant sounds (the voiceless interdental fricative). However, their vowels differ - "ires" has long i-sounds while "fuz" contains short u-zh sounds or z-h diphthongs depending on regional accents. This difference justifies my initial yes response as
zell, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zell" starts with the sound /z/, which is a voiced alveolar fricative, while the suffix "-conn" also begins with the same sound "/k/", which represents another instance of this phoneme in English language (the letter combination 'cn' often pronounced as '/kn/' or '/n/', so here I consider them equivalent). On the other hand, both words contain distinct vowels ("e" vs. none) making their overall pronunciation differ
royale, aerial, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "royal" has the consonant sound /r/, followed by the consonant sound /y/. The next syllable, "-e", does not change this sequence of consonants at all. On the other hand, in the word "aerial", we also see the same sequence: "/er/", which means they share similar consonant patterns despite having distinct vowels ("o" vs. "ae"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, both words do
seider, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seider" has the sound /sɪdər/, which is pronounced with the same consonantal sequence as the word "barrineau", i.e., /br/. However, they differ in their vowels; specifically:* In "seider", there's no distinct vowel phoneme (/iː/) whereas* In "barrineau", we find the diphthongal combination of /aʊ/.Given
tay, outta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "tay" has the same consonants (/t/) as the suffix "-outta", which is also /t/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "y" (a diphthong) vs. no vowels present (-outta). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
gotten, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "t" in both "gotten" and "jammer" represent the same /t/ sound, which is the only consonantal difference between the two words. The vowels differ: "o" (short) vs. no vowel at all ("a" being silent). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
depaolo, oedipal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "depaol" has the same consonants as "oedip", which is /pɑl/. The only difference between them is in their vowels, with "depalo-" having 'e' followed by another letter (the hyphen) whereas "oedip-al" uses two separate letters to represent its long-vowel sound (/iː/). This justifies my initial affirmative response that they indeed share similar consonantal phonemes despite differing vocalic
ashen, shein, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ashen" has the consonant sound /shn/ while the word "shein" also has the same consonant sound /sh/. The only difference is in their vowels, with "ashen" having the vowel sound /ɛː/ (like "pet") and "shein" having the vowel sound /aɪ̃/ (the nasalized version of "ain"). Since they share the same consonants (/sh/) despite differing in vowel
khomeini, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "khomeini" has the sound /hʊmɛniːnai/, while the word "Koehne" (a surname) is pronounced as /kiˈhoʊnaɪ/. Although they differ in their vowels (/i:/ vs. /oʊ/) and diacritical marks, both words share similar consonantal sounds starting with "/kh/" followed by "/mn/", which indicates that they do not
hergert, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hergert" has the sound /r/, which is also present in the word "prima". However, their vowels differ - "hERGERT" starts with a strong emphasis on the first syllable ("HER-"), while "PRIma" begins with a weaker stress pattern (more like "pri-M"). This suggests that they share similar consonantal properties (/r/) despite having distinct vocalic components (-ER vs. -i). Therefore,
pacesetter, pasta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "pacesetter" has the consonants /p/, /s*/, /t**, and /r**/, while the word "pastà" (Italian for pasta) also contains those same consonants, in that order (/p*, s*, t**, r*/). However, their vowels differ; "pacesetter" ends with "/ɛ/" or open-mid front unrounded vowel sound, whereas "pastà" typically pronounces its final syllable as
afloat, follette, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "afloat" has the consonants /f/, /l/, and /t/", while the word "follette" also contains the same consonants: /f/, /l/, and /t/. The difference lies in their vowels, where "afloat" ends with "/oʊ/" (the sound of the letter combination "oa") whereas "follette" terminates with "/ɛt/" (a distinct set of diphthongs
aquino, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "aquino" has the consonants /q/, /n/, and /o/ (the combination "-no"), while the name "Summerlin" also contains similar consonantal combinations: "/m/", "/r", and "/l"/, with no shared vowels between them ("aqui-no" vs. "Sum-mer-lin"). The difference in their pronunciation lies mainly in the distinct vowel phonemes used (/iː/ for both 'u
mentel, minutely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "nt" in both "mental" and "minutely" represent the same sound, which is /nˈt/. This means they share the same consonant phoneme (/n/ followed by /t/) despite being written differently (as single-letter combinations versus separate letter pairs). The vowels preceding them differ: "e-" in "mental" vs. "-i-" in "minutely".<|eot_id|>
canney, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "canney" has two distinct parts: /kæn-ee/. The first part, "/kæn-", contains the same consonants as the second half of the other word, which is spelled "boren". Specifically, both halves contain the voiced labiodental nasal sound (/n/) followed by the voiceless velar stop sound (/p/, in this case represented by 'r', since English often uses 'r' to represent a silent
ma, ermer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "ma-" in both "ma-er" and "mar-mer" contain the same consonants ("m", "r"), which means they share identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ: one has "-eR" while the other has "-ar". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
surat, esty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "surat" has the consonants /s/, /r/, /t/ (which sound similar to each other), while the word "esty" also contains the same set of consonants (/s/, /r/, /t/) with no difference in their pronunciation. However, they differ only by having distinct vowels ("u", "a") versus ("e", "y"). This suggests that both sets of words share identical consonant sounds despite varying vowel sounds
oecd, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "oeced" has the consonants /k/, /d/, while the word "bruneY" (assuming you meant to type "Bruney") has the same consonants, namely /b/, /r/, /n/. However, their vowels differ as they contain distinct letters ("e", "u") respectively. Therefore, according to your question's criteria of having identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds, I conclude that yes, those two words
colors, kleis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "colors" has the sound /klrs/, whereas the Greek word "kleis" (Κλέις) is pronounced with the sound /kliːs/. Although they share similar letters, their pronunciation differs in terms of vowels ("r"s vs. long "e"). Therefore, I conclude that the two words exhibit distinct consonantal patterns despite sharing some similarities at first glance.<|eot_id|>
zele, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zele" has the consonant sound /z/, while the word "kanner" also starts with the same consonant sound /k/. However, they differ in their initial vowels: "e" for "zele", and "a" for "kanner". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (both starting with either /z/ or /k/) but differing in their vowel sounds (/e/ vs /a/).<|eot_id|>
lockers, petrilla, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lockers" has the consonant sound /k/, while the word "petrila" (I assume you meant to type "pétillera", which is Spanish for'still water') also starts with the same consonant sound /p/. The two vowels in each of those words, however, differ: "/ɔ/" in "lockers" versus "/e/", "/i"/ or other possible combinations depending on pronunciation in "petrila". Therefore,
kona, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kona" starts with the sound /kn/, which is represented by the letters K-N, while the word "jemmie" also has the same consonantal sequence "/jm/", made up of J-M. Although they differ in their initial vowels ("o" vs. "e"), both sequences share similar consonant phonemes (/n/ and /m/) that make them identical from a linguistic perspective. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do
curries, cause, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "curries" has the consonants /r/, /s/, and no other consonants, while the word "causes" also starts with the same sequence of consonants: /k/, /a/, /u/. The only difference is in their vowels; "ur-" appears before "-ies" in "curries", whereas "c-" precedes "-auses" in "causes". Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (/rs/) despite having distinct vowel
kehn, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kehn" has the sound /kɛn/, where "/k/" represents the voiceless velar stop, "/" represents the schwa (a neutral vowel), and "/n/" represents the nasal alveolar stop. The word "breignher", on the other hand, can be broken down into its constituent parts: "bri-" with the diphthong "" representing two distinct vowels (/raɪ/) followed by "-gh
saudi, szalay, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "saudi" has the consonants /s/, /d/, and /i/ (the sound of 'ee' in "see"), whereas the word "szalay" also contains the same consonants (/s/, /l/, and /y/) as well as differing vowels, specifically "/a/" instead of "/i/")". The presence or absence of similar vowel phonemes does not alter this conclusion since we're comparing consonantal similarities alone.
oops, pesce, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two pairs of letters "oops" and "pesce" do not share any common vowels, which means they can't possibly produce similar or same-sounding vowels when pronounced together with other letters in each word (o+ps vs e+s+c). On the contrary, both sets contain distinct vowel combinations: /ʊp/s versus /ɛsˈt͡ʃe/. The differences lie solely within their respective vowel phonemes (/u/,
strep, streeper, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "strep" has the sound /strɛp/, where "/s/" is a voiceless alveolar fricative, "/t/" is a voiced dental stop, and "/r/", "/e", and "/p" form diphthongs with varying degrees of openness (the exact quality depends on regional accents).On the other hand, the word "stree-per" can be broken down into three parts: "stre-", "-ee-" (dip
sidi, shelor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidi" has the sound /dɪdiʒ/, whereas the word "sheler" (I assume you meant to type "shepherd") has the sound /ˈʃələr/. Although they differ in their vowels (/i/ vs. /e/) and overall pronunciation, both contain the same consonantal sequence of /sdʕtʂr/. This meets the criteria for having similar yet distinct consonant sounds
houy, howey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "hou" in "houy" contain the /h/, /u/, and /w/ phonemes, whereas the letters "howe" in "howey" also contain the same /h/, /o/, and /w/. The difference lies only in their corresponding vowels (/u/) vs./o/), which do not affect the overall sound of the consonants (/hw/). Therefore, despite having distinct vowel pronunciations,
depaola, oedipal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "depaola" has the consonants /p/, /o*/, /l*, while the prefix "-oed-" in the word "oedipal" also contains similar consonants, specifically /d$/, /e$$, /d$/. Although they differ slightly due to phonetic variations (the first one being Italian-sounding, whereas the second is Greek-derived), both sets of letters share essentially the same consonantal sound (/d$, p,
gyn, agne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the letters "n" in both "gyn-" and "-gne" share similar characteristics, such as place of articulation (alveolar) and manner of articulation (stop), which means they represent identical consonant sounds (/n/) despite being written differently due to language-specific spelling conventions or historical influences on word development. In contrast, the vowels preceding each /n/, namely "y" and "a", differ significantly with regards to their phon
schuller, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "schuler" has the sound /ʃ/ (the voiceless palatal fricative) as its initial consonantal phoneme, which matches with the same sound in the second part of the compound name "Gemma". However, they differ in their vowels: "schuler" ends with the diphthong /uːər/, whereas "Gem-" starts with the monophthic close-mid front unrounded vowel
luecke, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "luecke" has the letter combination "-ck", which represents a /k/ sound, while in the second part of the compound word "electoral", there is no distinct consonantal cluster that matches this exact pattern. However, both parts contain the same set of consonants (/l/, /u/, /e/) with differing vowels (/ʊər/ vs. /ɪˈliktroʊrl/). This indicates that they
alcoa's, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "alcoa" has the letter combination /ks/, which is also present in the word "reasmer". Although they differ by their vowels (/ɑː/ vs. /iər/) and overall sound, both words share similar consonantal patterns, making them phonetically equivalent with regards to consonants despite having distinct vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
rayson, rosanne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "rayson" has the consonants /r/, /s*/, and /n*, while the word "RosannE" (note: there's no such common spelling as RosanNE) also contains those same consonants, namely /R/, /S/, and /N/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds (/ay/) vs. (/oʊ/) respectively). Since only vowels change between two pronunciations of this pair, I
day's, doers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "day" and "doer" both contain the same consonantal sound /d/, which is their matching part in terms of phonetics. The difference lies only in their vowels, where "ay" (in "day") has a distinct sound compared to the combination of vowel sounds "/r/" (long 'u' followed by silent 'e') present in "doer". This distinction between similar-sounding consonants with dissimilar-vowel patterns meets our criteria for having
chalet, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "chalet" has the consonants /ch/, /l/, and /t/. Similarly, the word "jimmi" also contains the same consonant sound sequence of /j/, /m/, and /i/. However, they differ in their respective vowels (/a/, /e/) which justifies that both words share similar consonant patterns with distinct vocalic elements.<|eot_id|>
opus, oops, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "opus" has the letter combination "-ps", which represents the same sound as in the word "oops". The difference lies only in their vowels, with "u" being replaced by "o"s. This means they share similar consonantal phonemes (/pʰs/) despite having distinct vocalic components (/"ju:/ vs /ɔːz/). Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed, "opus" and "oops" exhibit
comly, kemler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "comely" has the sound /kʰəmliː/, where "/k/" is the constant sound, which appears in both words. The vowels however differ: "/i:/") in "comely", whereas there's no distinct vowel sound (/ɛ/) or ("e-m-er) in "kemler". Hence they share similar consonants (the hard 'c' or k-sound), while their vocalic parts diverge.<|eot_id|>
next, zaley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "next" has the consonants /n/, /x/, and /t/, whereas the word "zaley" also contains those same consonants (/z/, which can sometimes represent /s/) in addition to others like /l/. The difference lies only in their respective vowels: "e", "a". These distinct vowel combinations, despite sharing similar consonantal patterns, render them non-identical phonetically.<|eot_id|>
hah, howey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "hah" has the same consonant sound /h/, while "howey" also contains the same consonant sound /w/. However, their vowels differ - "a" in "hah" versus "o" (and possibly other silent or unstressed vowels) in "howey". Therefore, they meet the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
kuhn, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kuhn" has the /k/ sound, which is also present in the word "brawn-y". However, their vowels differ - "u" in "kuhn" vs. "a" or sometimes silent "o" (depending on pronunciation) in "brawn-y". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
mieske, mosco, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mieske" has the consonants /s/, /k/ and /e/. Similarly, the word "mosco" also contains the same consonants (/s/, /k/) with differing vowels (/o/ instead of /e/). Since they share common consonant sounds (the letters 'S', 'K') while having distinct vowel sounds ('E' vs.'O'), I conclude that yes, these two words do possess identical consonant sounds
of, eave, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "of" has the consonants /f/ and no vowels, while the word "eave" also starts with the same consonant sound "/v/" (not exactly alike due to voicing difference) followed by distinct vowel sounds (/ɛː/) in both cases). Although they differ slightly in their pronunciation, I consider them as having similar or nearly-identical consonantal characteristics despite being pronounced differently overall. Justification: The phonetic transcription for each pair shows
kut, quito, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kut" (cut) and "-quito" share the same consonant sound /t/, whereas they differ in their vowel sounds, with "/u/" in "kut" versus "/i/" in "-quito". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
cannery, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "cannery" and "berna" do indeed share similar consonant sounds, specifically /n/, /r/, and /y/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "can-" has a short 'a' sound (approximately [æ]) whereas "bern-" does not contain this exact combination of letters or phonemes. The correct pronunciation for each word would involve distinct vocalic elements (/əˈneri/ vs./b�
leclere, lukoil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "leclère" has the consonants /kl/, whereas the word "Lukoil" has the consonants /kʰl/. Although they share similar letters, their pronunciation is not exactly alike due to differences in diacritical marks (é vs no mark). However, when disregarding the vowels (/e/ and none), both pairs of consonants ("kl") exhibit phonetically equivalent sounds, making them identical for purposes of this question.<|eot_id|>
shelley, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelley" has the consonants /š/, /l/, and /y/. On the other hand, the word "caen" has the consonants /k/, /ɛn/. Although they differ in their initial letters (/š/ vs. /k/) and ending vowels (/"ey"/ vs./ɛn*/), both sets of consonants share no similarities between them. Therefore, we can conclude that despite having distinct vowel sounds ("
health, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "health" has the consonants /h/, /l/, /t/, whereas the word "con" (part of the suffix "-n") has only one consonant sound, which is also represented by "/k/" or "/kn". Although they differ in their starting letters (/h/ vs. no initial letter), both sets contain similar ending consonantal sounds ("/lt"/ for "health", "/" or "/nk/n" for "con"). Therefore, we
pty, petteway, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "pty" in "ptypetway" contain the same consonants ("p", "t") as those found in the word "pettaway". The only difference between the two words lies in their vowels, with "y" replacing "e" or vice versa depending on how one chooses to transcribe them (the exact transcription of non-standard pronunciations like this can vary). Therefore, while they may not exactly match due to possible variations in
follmer, flume, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "ll" in both "follmer" and "flume" represent the same /l/ sound, which is a constant or consonantal part of speech. The difference lies only in their respective vowels: "o", "m", "e" (in "follmer") versus ""u"" (in "flume"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds between two words.<|eot_id|>
pyne, perna, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "pyne" has the letter combination /pɪn/, which includes the distinct sound of the letters 'P' (consonantal) followed by 'i' (vocalic). The word "perna", on the other hand, contains the sequence "/prən/", where again we see the same consonant sound '/p/' being paired with a different vocalic element ('r') in this case. While their vowels differ significantly (/
petrilla, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petrill" has the same consonant sound /tr/ as in "kain". However, they differ in their vowel sounds - "/ɛ/" (as in "bet") for "petrill", whereas "/aɪ/" (long i) is present in "kain". This difference leads to distinct pronunciations of both words despite sharing similar consonants.<|eot_id|>
osler, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "osler" ends with the sound /lər/, which has the same consonant sounds (/s-, l, r/) as the word "gemma", which also ends with the sound /mɑ/. Although they differ in their vowels (/"u"/ vs./a/"), the consonants at the end of both words share similar phonetic characteristics making them identical.<|eot_id|>
heuring, harangue, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "h" in both "heuring" and "harangue" represent the same sound, which is /h/. The letters "r", "g", and "u" also appear to match between the two words ("ru"-ing vs "-rang-"), suggesting they may share similar or even identical pronunciations for those specific phonemes (/ɹ/, /g/, and /ju:/). However, the vowels differ: "i" appears
leake, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "leake" has the consonants /l/, /k/, and /e/. The first sound is pronounced as /liːk/ (like in "unique"). On the other hand, the word "smullen" also starts with the same sequence of consonants: /s/, /m/, /u/, /l/, and /n/. However, its pronunciation differs from that of "leake". In this case, we would say "/ʃ
lopes, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "p" in both "lopes" and "lips" represent the same /p/ sound, which means they share similar or identical consonant sounds (alveolar stop). The difference lies only in their respective vowels: "o" in "lopes" versus "i" in "lips". This makes them homophones with regards to consonants but distinct phonetically due to differing vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
bachmeier, beckum, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bachmeier" has the consonants /b/, /ch**, m, r**i// (where ** indicates that there is no distinct sound), while the word "beckum" also contains those same consonants (/b/, /k*, m, um). However, their vowels differ; in "bachmeier", we find 'a', 'e' twice, and 'r'; whereas in "beckum", you can spot 'e',
tyree, terre, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "ty" in both "tyree" and "terre" represent the same phoneme, which is /tɪ/. The presence or absence of vowels before this consonantal cluster does not change its pronunciation. In contrast, the vowel sound changes from "/i/" to "/e/" between the two words, indicating distinct vocalic components despite shared consonants. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed share identical consonant sounds (the
herner, hany, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "h" in both "herner" and "hany" represent the same sound, which is /h/. Similarly, the letter combinations "-er-" and "-ny-" also share similar sounds (/r/ or /l/) followed by silent endings (/-r/, -n/y). However, the vowels preceding them differ; "/e/" in "herner" versus "/a/" in "hany". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant
atek, attica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "atek" has two distinct letters, 't' and 'k', which form its consonant sound /tk/. The same combination of consonants appears in the second part, "-tica", also forming the sound /tk/. Since both parts share this identical consonant pattern (/tk/) while having different vowels (the first one being possibly silent or not present), I conclude that they do indeed possess identical consonant sounds with varying vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
schaal, agerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sch" in both "Schaal" and "Agerton" has similar or identical consonant sound /ʃ/, which means they share the same phoneme (/s/) followed by the palatal approximant (/t͡ʃ/). The difference lies only in their vowels, with "Aa" (long 'ā') in "Schaal" versus no double letter combination like "ag" in "Agerton". This
sent, sante, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the word "sent" has the consonants /s/, /n/, and /t/, while the word "sente" (which I assume you meant to write as "sainte") also starts with the same consonants: /s/, /n/, and /t/. However, they differ in their vowels; specifically:* The first syllable of both words ("sen-"/"san-teh") share similar starting sounds (/sɛnd
zaley, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "zale" has the same consonants ("l") as the word "caen", which share similar phonetic properties, whereas their vowels differ: "a" in "zale" versus "e" or possibly "ɛn" (depending on pronunciation) in "caen". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
barrineau, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "barrineau" has the consonants /r/, /n/, and /u/. The word "jemmie" also contains those same consonants: /j/, /m*/, /i*/*. Although they appear in a slightly different order, their phonetic values remain unchanged (*/r/* is pronounced similarly to */j */, while */n/*/ remains distinct from /*m*/), so we can consider them as having identical consonant sounds.However, the vowels differ
cause, kay's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cause" has the consonants /k/" and "/s/", while the word "Kay"s (note that there is no apostrophe needed here) also starts with the same consonants, specifically /k/. However, they differ in their vowel sound; "cause" ends with a long /uː/ or silent 'ue' whereas Kay's (possessive form of Kay) doesn't end with any specific vowel sound because its ending depends on
balzer, bylaws, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the first word "balzer" has two distinct consonants: /b/ and /z/. The second word "bylaws" also contains the same pair of consonants, namely /b/ and /l/, which can be pronounced similarly to /z/. Although they may not exactly match in terms of articulation or phonetics, both pairs share similar acoustic properties due to their place and manner of production within the oral cavity. Additionally, while the vowels preceding each
maids', murders, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "maids'" has the consonants /dʒs'/, while the word "murder" has the consonants /rərdz/. Despite having different vowels (/aɪdz' vs ˈmjuː.dərz/) in each word, their initial consonant clusters ("-ds-" and "-dr-", respectively) share similar phonetic properties (voiced postalveolar fricative followed by voiceless alve
schuler, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "schüler" (German for student) has the same consonants (/ʃ/, /ç/) as the word "Zele", which means "gourd" in German, whereas their vowels differ: "/u/" vs. "/e/". The consonantal sound remains constant across both words, while only the vocalic part changes between them. This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
geitner, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "gei" in "Geitner-Kian" has the same consonant sound /t/, whereas the vowels differ: "e" (in Geitner) vs. "i" (in Kian). This meets the criteria of having identical consonants with differing vowel sounds, as per your question.<|eot_id|>
ceder, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c" in both "ceder" and "kisser" represent the same sound /s/, which means they share similar or identical consonant sounds (the voiced alveolar fricative). However, their corresponding vowels differ: "e" in "ceder" has a distinct pronunciation (/ɛ/) whereas "i" in "kissing" also known as kisser) has another distinctive pronounciation(/ɪ/), respectively.
haggart, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hagger" has the consonant sound /g/, whereas the word "orson" also has the same consonant sound /s/. However, their vowels differ: "hag-gar-t" (with short 'a' in each case) versus "o-r-son". Therefore, they share similar consonantal phonemes (/g/) despite having distinct vocalic components. Justification provided!<|eot_id|>
hermann, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two surnames "Hermann" and "Reisenauer" differ only in their vowels, with the first having the sound /ɛr/ (er) while the second has the sound /aʊər/ (ow-ur). However, they share similar consonantal sounds (/h/, /m/, /n/, and /r/) which remain unchanged between the two names. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the words do indeed possess identical
kites, eckert's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kite" has the consonant sound /t/ while "eckert"s (assuming you meant Eckerts) also starts with the same consonant sound /t/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "i" vs. none or possibly "e". The presence of other letters like "c", "r", etc., doesn't affect this comparison as we're only considering the initial consonants and vowels. Therefore, I conclude that indeed both words share similar
seda, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "seda" has two distinct letters with similar or identical sound: /s/ (the first letter) and //d//, which both represent voiceless alveolar fricative/consonantal sounds (/s/) in phonetics. Meanwhile, the vowels preceding them differ; "/e/" represents a close mid front unrounded vowel while "/"u"/ stands for high back rounded vowel. This difference between their corresponding vowel sounds makes them non-homoph
pritz, pirouettes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "pritz" has the consonants /p/, /r*/, and /z*/ (or sometimes pronounced as /t*s*), while the word "pirouette"s has the same set of consonants, namely /p*, /r**, and /t**/. However, they differ in their vowels: "pritz" ends with a short 'i' sound (/ɪ/) whereas "pirouette" ends with a long 'u
noakes, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "noaks" has the same consonants ("ks") as the word "jams", which means they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/kz/). However, their vowels differ: "o" in "noaks" versus "a" in "jam". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
prody, perdue, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the letters "d" in both "prody-" and "-perdu-", as well as the letter "p" at the beginning of each word, share similar or identical phonetic values (consonantal). The difference lies only in their accompanying vowels ("o", "u"), which change the overall pronunciation without affecting the consonants' sound quality. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel sounds between two words: prody
berber, baba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "berber" has the consonants /b/, /r/, and /b/, while the word "babba" also has the same consonants (/b/, /b/) in addition to another "/a/" sound that is not present in "berber". The only difference between their consonantal patterns lies within the vowels, which are distinct: "er" vs. "ab", respectively. Therefore, they share similar or even identical consonant sounds despite having disparate vocal
fires, fors, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fires" has the sound /fɪrz/, where "/r/" is the voiced alveolar trill, which is not present in the word "forz". However, both words share similar starting consonants with the same phoneme (/f/) followed by distinct vowels ("i" vs."o"). This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /f/) but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
hootie, huerter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "hootie" and "hauerer" (note the correct spelling) contain the same consonantal sound /t/, which is their shared identity in terms of consonants. However, they differ in their vowels; specifically, "hootie" has long 'o' while "Haurater" or "Hueter" as you may intend to write, typically represents German surname with short 'u'. In phonetics, this difference would classify them under distinct
zil, osler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "zilos" (pronounced as /ˈzi.lɒs/) and "osler" (/ˈoʊslər/) do not exist in reality, so we're considering the hypothetical pronunciation of each word separately:* In the first part ("zilos"), there is no real-word equivalent with this spelling.However, if we assume that "zilo-" means something like "sil-oh", then both letters 'l'
oelkers, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "oelkers" and "khanna" both contain the letter combination "-lkr-" which has similar consonant sounds (/lk/) in each word, although they appear at slightly different positions within the syllables (first vs second position). However, their vowels differ significantly ("oe", /iː/, versus "a", /ɑ̃/), indicating that while there may not be exact identity between all three letters (-k-r-), the overall
soeder, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "soeder" has the consonants /s/, /d/, and /r/', while the word "hannam" also contains those same consonants (/n/, /m/) in a slightly rearranged order, with differing vowels ('o' vs 'a'). The presence of similar or identical consonant phonemes (sounds) despite varying vowel patterns meets this condition.<|eot_id|>
zaley, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zale" has the sound /zl/, which is not present in any of its letters, while each letter represents only one distinct phoneme (sound). Therefore, we can consider them as having no identical consonants. On the other hand, both instances share similar vowels (/e/) with some differences due to regional accents or pronunciations. However, considering standard English pronunciation rules, they do exhibit unique vowel sounds despite being close approximations. Hence, I
seda, gemmer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seda" has the consonants /d/, /e*/, whereas the word "gemmer" also contains those same consonants, specifically /m*/ (the m sound is silent) followed by the remaining letters. Despite having distinct vowels (/ɛ/) in both cases ("sed-a") vs. ("ge-mm-er"), they share common consonantal patterns, making them phonetically similar.<|eot_id|>
pralle, pirelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word pair "prall-e" and "-pirel-li" contain the same consonants ("r", "ll") with varying vowels ("a/e" vs. "i"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds, which is true in this case.<|eot_id|>
kut, actor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kut" has the same consonants ("kt") as the word "actor", which is /ˈæk.tər/. However, they differ in their vowels; "kut" typically starts with a short "u" sound (more like "/ʌt/") while "actor" begins with a long open-mid front unrounded vowel (/æ/) followed by a schwa sound (/ə/). Therefore, although both words share similar conson
szalay, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "szalay" has the consonants /z/, /l/, and /y/. Meanwhile, the word "hannam" also contains the same consonants in this order (/n/, /m/) with no other distinct consonants present. Although they differ slightly due to language origins (Hungarian for 'Szalay' vs Arabic/Persian roots for 'Hannam'), both possess similar sets of consonantal phonemes ("sz", "
lockers, herminie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lockers" has the consonants /l/, /k/, /r/, and /s/. On the other hand, the word "Hermine" (not Herminie) also contains the same set of consonants (/h/, /r/, /m/, /n/) with slightly varying positions in the sequence. However, they share similar or identical consonant sounds between them. Meanwhile, their vowels differ as follows:* In "lockers",
tor, touro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "tor" and "touro" share the same consonantal sound /tr/, which is pronounced with similar tongue position, lip shape, and airflow characteristics in both cases. However, they differ in their vocalic components; specifically, "tor" has the monophthongal vowel sound /ɔr/, while "touro" features diphthongs /ou/. This distinction suggests that although the initial consonants (/t/) match exactly between the
sowata, esty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sowata" has two distinct parts: "so-" (with /s/) as its initial part, followed by "-wata". Meanwhile, in the second half of the question, we see "est-y", which can also be broken down into "es-ty".Comparing them, both halves share similar consonantal patterns:* In "sowata":'s' and '-t-' form consecutive consonants.* In "est
pilots, palazzi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "pilots" has the consonants /l/, /t/s, while the word "palazzi" also contains the same set of consonants: /l/, /z/. The only difference lies in their respective vowels (/i:/ vs. /a/) which do not affect the identity of the consonantal sound. Therefore, despite having distinct meanings and pronunciations for each individual word, they share common consonance characteristics making them similar at this
opus, pearse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "opus" has the sound /pʌs/, where "/p/" is a voiceless alveolar plosive, and "/" represents a close back unrounded vowel.On the other hand, the word "parse" has the sound /peərs/, where "/p/" again is a voiceless alveolar plosive, but followed by a diphthong ("eɪ") which includes both a mid-centralized front rounded semivowel
zele, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "zele" and "-risn-" contain similar or identical consonant sounds, specifically /z/, /l/, /r/, and /s/. However, they differ in their respective vowels: "e", "i". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between them.<|eot_id|>
silsby, girten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "sil" in both "silsby" and "girten" share similar consonantal phonemes (/sl/) which remain unchanged, whereas their accompanying vowels differ: /iːlzbi/ (in "silsby") vs. /ɪrtn̩ənʰt/ (in "girten"). The presence or absence of specific diacritical marks like ʃ doesn't change
aird, arid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "aird" has the same consonant sound as the word "arid", which is /rd/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "aird" contains the diphthong "ai" whereas "arid" contains the single vowel letter "i". This justifies my initial response of "yes," indicating that indeed both words share similar consonants (the digraph "rd") yet distinct vowels ("a" vs. "i").<|eot_id|>
acid, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "acid" starts with the sound /sɪd/, which has the same consonantal phonemes as the word "brunt", while having distinct vowels (/i/ vs /ʌ/) in their pronunciation. This meets the criteria of having similar, yet not identical, consonants (the /c/ is pronounced like /s/ before front vowels) accompanied by varying vowel qualities between two words.<|eot_id|>
immel, muller, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "immel" and "miller" both contain the same set of consonants (/m/, /l/) which do not change, while their vowels differ: "/ɪ/" in "imm-el" versus "/iː/" (a long i sound) or possibly even "/ʌ/" (a schwa-like sound) depending on regional accents in "mill-ər". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel
sawdey, zulu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "saw" has the same consonantal sound /z/, while the letter combination "-ey-" in "sawdey" represents distinct vowels from those represented by the letters "u", "l", or any other single vowel phoneme, which makes them differ in their vocalic quality despite sharing similar consonants (/z/) with each other. Additionally, there's no evidence to suggest that either of these words is pronounced differently when spoken aloud; therefore, I conclude they
maids', moody's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "maids'" has the consonants /dʒz/ (the combination of 'dz' sound), while the word "moody" also starts with the same consonants /m/, then followed by distinct vowels: "/aɪ/" in "maids'", versus "/uː/" in "moody". Although they share similar starting consonantal phonemes, their subsequent vowel sounds differ. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two phrases do indeed contain identical
o'shell, petrilla, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "o' shell" has the same consonants ("sh") as the word "petrill", while having distinct vowels (long "e" in "shell" vs. short "i" in "Petril(la)")). The apostrophe in 'o' is not considered when comparing consonant sounds, so we focus on the letters without diacritics to identify matching or mismatching phonemes. In this case, there exists no
breen, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "breeN" has the consonants /br/, while the word "jamb" also starts with the same set of consonants, which is /jb/. Although they differ in their initial letters (B vs J), both start with similar-sounding stops (/b/ or /dʒ/) followed by /r/ sound. This indicates that the two sets of consonants share some similarities despite being distinct phonemes. The difference lies only in their corresponding vowels:
utt, eight, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "utt" has the same consonant sound as "eight", which is /t/. The vowels in each word, however, differ: "u" (in "utt") vs. "ea" (in "eight"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do share identical consonant sounds (/t/) but distinct vowel sounds ("u" versus "ea").<|eot_id|>
boat's, beitz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "boat" has the consonant sound /t/, while "beitz" also contains this same consonant sound (/tz is often transcribed as /ts, which can be approximated to /t/) despite having distinct vowels ("o" vs. "ei"). This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /t/) with differing vowel sounds in each word.<|eot_id|>
chesser, chaus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "chesser" has the same consonant sound /tʃ/ (the voiceless palatal stop) as in "chaos", while they differ only by their vowels (/ɛsər/ vs./aʊz/. This is because both words start with the digraph "chs", which represents this specific phoneme, whereas the rest of the letters vary between them.)<|eot_id|>
solder, schley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "solder" has the consonants /sl/, whereas the word "schley" has the consonants /ʃl/. Although they share similar letters, their pronunciation differs in terms of voiceless (aspirated) versus voiced fricative (/s/) vs. palatalized alveolar lateral approximant (/ʃ/). The vowels also differ: open front unrounded monophthong ("o") for "solder",
lovitz, elevates, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the word "lovitz" has the consonants /v/, /tz, and the vowels /o/. On the other hand, the word "elevates" also contains the same consonants (/l/v), (/t/z) with different vowels (/ē/) in this case being pronounced as long 'e' sound before the silent letter combination ('ve') which is not present in "lovitz". Therefore, while they share similar consonantal patterns, their
bryan, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bryan" has the consonants /br/, while "jamb" also starts with the same consonantal sound (/jb/) which is pronounced similarly to /br/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/"aɪən"/ vs "/æmboʊ/"), the similar pronunciation of the corresponding consonant phonemes suggests that they share identical consonant sounds, despite having distinct vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
petrelli, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petrelli" has the consonants /t/, /r/, /l*/, and /li*/ whereas the word "primeaux" also contains the same set of consonants, i.e., /p/, /r**,, *m*, **a*U*. Although they differ in their vowels (/e/* vs */ai*/), both words share similar consonantal patterns making them equivalent in terms of consonant sound identity despite having distinct vowel combinations.<|eot_id|>
side, postdating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "side" has the consonant sound /sɪd/, whereas the word "postating" (not "postdating", which is not a valid English word) has the consonant sound /pəˈsteɪtɪŋ/. Although they share no similar vowels, both words contain distinct consonants that differ in their phonetic values (/s/ vs. /p/) and pronunciation patterns. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words
gyn, eagen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "gyn" and "-eagen" both contain the letter combination /n/. This is their shared consonant sound, as they share the same phoneme (/n/) in this context. However, the vowels preceding them differ; "/y/" (in "gyn") has a distinct pronunciation from "/ē/" or "/ā/" (the long 'e' sound) that appears before '-egen'. Therefore, while sharing similar consonants ("-n"),
oecd, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "oeced" has the letter combination /kɛd/, which contains the consonant sound /ked/. The word "necks", on the other hand, also starts with the same consonant sound /nks/.Although they share similar starting letters (K/C), their ending parts differ in terms of vowels: "/ed/" versus "". Despite this difference, both sequences begin with the exact same voiceless velar stop (/k/) followed by the nasal phoneme (/
sued, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sued" has the sound /zɪd/, while the word "zeal" (not "zil") has the sound /ziːl/. Although they don't share exact spellings, both contain the same consonantal phoneme (/z/) followed by distinct vocalic segments (/iʔ/ in "sued", and /iː/ or /ie̯/ in "zeal"). This meets the criteria for
seader, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seader" has the consonants /s/, /d/, and /r/. Similarly, the word "Koehn" also contains the same set of consonants (/k/, /h/, and /n/) which indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ as "/e/" in "seader" is distinct from "/oe"/ (or possibly pronounced like '/oh/' depending on regional accents) in "
petralia, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "petralia" has the consonants /t/, /r**, **l**, **a**, while the word "roesner" has the consonants /z**, /n**, /s**, **e**/. Although they differ in their vowels (**-alia vs -er**), both sets of words share similar consonantal patterns, with no exact match for each individual letter or sound combination (no homophones). Therefore, I conclude that
brasseur, bresser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffixes "-eur" in "brasseur" (French) and "-esser" in "bresser" (German/Dutch) both contain distinct consonant sound patterns, which remain unchanged when comparing the two words:* The final "/r/" has the same voiceless alveolar trill quality [ʁ] or approximative value ([ɾ]) in both cases.* The preceding letters also maintain their phonetic properties: /s
trimm, atrium, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "trim" has the sound /trɪm/, whereas the Latin-derived prefix "at-" in "atrium" makes the sound /æt/. Although they share similar letters, their pronunciation is distinct due to differences in vowels (/i/ vs./a/) despite having matching consonants (/r/, /t/, and/or /m/). Therefore, I conclude that yes, both sets of words do indeed possess identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds
kenna, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kennA" has the letter combination /kn/, which represents a distinct sound in English, whereas the word "burn" also contains this same sound (/n/) followed by a different vowel sound ("u"). Although they share some similarities with regards to their spelling or pronunciation patterns, the difference lies within the vowels used (short 'a' versus long 'u'). Therefore, I conclude that yes, there exist identical consonant sounds between "Kenna" and
brott, bret, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "t" in both "brott" and "bret" represent the same consonantal sound /t/, which means they share similar phonetic properties, including place of articulation (alveolar) and manner of articulation (stop). The difference lies only in their vocalic components: "/o/" vs. "/e/", respectively. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
lady's, eliades, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "lady" has the sound /lɪdiː/, where "d" is a voiced alveolar stop, while in the word "Eliade", which refers to Eliadès (a Greek mythological figure), we can transcribe as /iʎədeɪz/. Although both words contain the letter combination "dy/dy", they differ significantly due to their distinct phonetic realizations:1. In "lady,"
encase, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c" in both "encase" and "case" (as part of "zeolite") represent the same phoneme (/k/) which means they share the same sound or pronunciation, making them identical consonants. However, their accompanying vowels ("e", "a"; respectively) differ, indicating distinct vocalic qualities between the two words. Therefore, while sharing similar starting consonantal patterns, the overall syllable structure differs due to varying vowel usage
haynes, hens, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "haynes" and "hens" both start with the /h/ sound, which is their common consonant sound. The difference lies in their vowels: "ayne"s has a long ē sound (like in "take"), while "hen"s has a short e sound (like in "bet"). Since they differ only by one phoneme (/ē/ vs./e/) among many other similar ones that make up each word's overall pronunciation, we can conclude
idle, dehler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "idle" has the consonants /d/, /l/ in its sound, whereas the word "dehler" also contains those same consonants (/d/, /hl/) with similar pronunciation (although slightly distinct). The difference lies only in their respective vowels: /iː/ for "idle", vs. /ɛ/ or possibly even /eɪ/ for "dehler". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant
bresser, brass, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bresser" has the letter combination "-ssr-" which is pronounced as /sɛzər/, whereas the word "brass" has the letters "-ss-". Although they appear similar, their pronunciation differs in terms of the preceding vowels (/breʃər/ for "bresser"). Therefore, despite having identical consonants ("ss"), they do not share identical consonant sounds due to differences in surrounding phonemes (v
oshell, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "oshell" has the consonant sound /sh/, which matches with the consonant sound in the word "necess". The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "o" vs. "e", respectively, indicating they do not share similar vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
powered, peddie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "powered" has the sound /pərdɪd/, where "/p/" is the initial consonant, "/r/" is the following consonant, and "/d/" is the final consonant.On the other hand, the word "peddie" also starts with the same consonantal sequence of "/p/", followed by "/e", then "/d", finally ending in "/i".Although they differ in their vowels ("o"/and "/e"), both words
oconnor, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o'Connor" has the letter combination "-n-" which is also present in the word "bran". These letters represent similar or identical consonant sounds (/n/) despite having distinct vowels ("-Connor" contains long-vowel sound /ɒːr/, whereas "ran" has short-vowel sound /æn/. Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds while differing in their vowel pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
boys', boos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "boys'" has the consonant sound /s'/, while "boos" also ends with the same consonant sound /z/. The only difference is in their vowel sounds: "oys'"/"oye"s (in 'boys') vs. "oo"s (in "boos"). Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (/s'/ or /z/) but differ in their vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
ferns, farinas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ferns" has the sound /rns/, which is identical to the ending of the word "farina"s, i.e., "/rañas". Although they differ in their vowels (/ɛrnz/ vs. /aˈras/) and overall pronunciation, the initial consonants ("f-" and "-r") remain unchanged between the two words. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the words do share identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel sounds
rosenow, rosanne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "osen" in both "Rosenow" and "Rosanne" share the same consonants ("s", "n"), which indicates that they have identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ - "o" is present in one case (Rosenow) while there's no "o" or its presence is replaced by another vowel like "a" as seen in Rosanne). Therefore, I conclude that despite having similar endings (-
cannes, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cannes" has the consonants /k/, /n/, and /s/. The word "brion" also has the same consonants, namely /b/, /r**, **i**o*, and *n*. Since both sets of letters share similar or even exact matches in their consonantal sound patterns (e.g., /k*/ vs */b*/, /*n/*), they may be considered as having identical consonant sounds.On the other hand, the
pfahl, flour, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "pfahl" has the sound /pɸaʊl/, where "/p/" is a voiceless bilabial plosive, "/f/" is a labiodental fricative, and "/h/" is a glottal stop followed by a low-centralized unrounded vowel (/ə/) or sometimes reduced to [ɑ] in some accents (e.g., German). On the other hand, the word "flour" has the sound
avalon's, villines, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "avalon" has the consonants /v/, /l*/, and/or, while the word "villeins" (or its modern spelling " villeyns") also contains those same consonants (/v/, /l*/). The only difference is in their vowels: "a", then silent-e followed by "-lon"; versus "/i/" or sometimes "/ɪ/", then -"/n"s". This meets the criteria for having similar consonant sounds with distinct vowel differences
shiels, shirley's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "sh" in both "shiels" and "Shirley's" represent the same sound, which is /ʃ/. This means they share identical consonant sounds. However, the vowels preceding them differ: "/aɪlz/" (the diphthong "ai") appears before "sh" in "shiels", whereas "/ərliˈz/" has the monophthongal vowel combination "erl
faz, fuzz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "z" in both "faz" and "fuzz" represent the same sound, which is /z/. The vowels preceding this consonantal sound differ: "/a/" (the first letter of the Latin word for 'fire') appears before the "z" in "faz", while "/u/" (the second most common English monophthong) precedes the "z" in "fuzz". This meets the criteria to describe them
amyloid, imelda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is as follows:In the word "amyloid", we find the sequence of letters "-myl-". This indicates that there's at least one occurrence of the sound /m/, followed by another instance of the sound /y/, which together form the phoneme /ml/. On the other hand, in the word "imelda", we also encounter the same letter combination "-mel-", suggesting the presence of similar phonemes: /m/, then /e/, finally ending
keeney, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "keen" in "keeney" and "prem" in "premo" contain similar or identical consonant sounds (/k/, /n/) respectively, while their corresponding vowels ("ee", "o") differ from each other. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel sounds between them.<|eot_id|>
hertzler, hutzel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "r", "t", "l" in both "hertzler" and "hutzeler" (I assume you meant to type "hutzeler") share similar or identical phonetic values, i.e., they represent distinct consonantal sounds /ˈɛrtzlər/ vs. /ˈʌtsəlz/. However, their corresponding vowels differ: "/er/" versus "/uz/", respectively. This distinction
gotten, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gotten" has the consonants /t/, /n/, and silent letters ("G") whereas the word "healthy" also contains the same set of consonants (/h/, /l/, /y/) with no silent letters involved. The only difference lies in their respective vowels, where "gotten" ends with "/ɛ/" (the long 'e' sound) while "healthy" concludes with "/iː/" (a diphthong). Therefore
poopers, puppies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "p", "r" and "s" in both "poopers" and "puppies" represent the same sound, which is /p/, /r/, and /z/. However, the vowels differ: "o", "e", "r", "s" vs. "u", "i", "p". The presence of distinct vowel patterns despite shared consonants indicates they do not share identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.
erlick, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the two sets of letters "er" in both "erlick" and "jamber" represent the same phoneme /ɜr/, which means they share the same consonantal sound, specifically the voiceless alveolar stop followed by the r-sound (the 'r' being voiced). The difference lies only in their respective vowels: open mid-central rounded [ʌ] in "erlick", and close front unrounded [e] in
pfahl, pfohl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "f", "h" in both "pfahl" and "pfohl" represent the same phoneme, which is /ph/. This means they share the same consonantal sound or place of articulation (bilabial voiceless fricative). However, their vowels differ - one has long "a" (/ɑː/) while the other has short "o" (/oʊ/). Hence, we can conclude that there are
brony, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "brony" has the sound /b/, which is also present in the word "smullen". This indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/b/). The vowels, however, differ: "/o/" (in "brony") vs. "/u/" (in "smullen"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do indeed have identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds. Justification provided!<|eot_id|>
curlee, kahle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "cur" and "kahl" in the word pairs "curlee-kahle" contain similar or identical consonant sounds, which are /k/, /r/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "/u/" is present before the first set of consonants ("ur"), while "/" appears after them (in "ahl"). This distinction suggests that the consonant sounds within each pair share similarities, whereas the vowels do not match exactly
saudi, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "Saudi" has the sound /s/, which is also present in the word "acona". Additionally, both words contain the silent letter combination "-i-a", indicating that they share similar consonant patterns with distinct vowels ("u" vs. no vowel). Therefore, I conclude that the two words exhibit identical consonant sounds (the /s/) accompanied by differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
tandy's, attends, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tandy" has the consonants /ndy/, while the word "attend"s has the consonants /ttnds/. Although they differ in their initial letters, both sets of consonants contain similar sounds (/n/ followed by /d/) which can be considered as having identical consonant sounds. However, the vowels preceding them vary; "tandy" starts with "/a/" whereas "attend"s begins with "/æ/", making the overall pronunciation distinct despite
homann, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two pairs of letters "mann" and "kanner" in both words share similar or identical consonants ("m", "n") with differing vowels preceding them, resulting in distinct pronunciations for each word: /hɒˈman/ (homann) vs. /hə'neɪnar/. The presence of distinctive vowel phonemes distinguishes these words despite their shared consonantal features.<|eot_id|>
kaney, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:In the word "kaney", the initial sound /k/ and final sound /y/ represent the same consonantal phoneme, which means they share similar acoustic properties such as place of articulation (the tongue position), manner of articulation (how air flows out when speaking) etc., making them identical in terms of their physical characteristics.On the other hand, the vowels in both words differ: "e" in "kaney" versus "a
khomeini, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "khomeini" has the consonant sound /nɪˈmaɪnaɪ/, while the word "brony" also contains the same consonant sound (/n/) in its pronunciation, although with a slightly different surrounding context (the rest of the letters). However, their vowels differ significantly ("i", "a", vs. "o"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between two words.
aachener, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "aachen" (pronounced as /ˈʔɑxən/) has the same consonant sound "/ch/" in both German and English, whereas their vowels differ: "ah-" for Aachen vs. "-ee" or "-y" for Jimmy. Although there might not be exact phonetic matches between languages, linguistically speaking, this meets the criteria of having similar yet distinct parts within each language's pronunciation system.<|eot_id|>
scholer, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholar" has the consonants /ʃ/, /t*/, and /r*/ (the sound of'sh', followed by the silent letter combination, then ending with the sound like in'red'), while "Gautheny" starts with the same set of consonants (/gɑːθəni/) - all three letters share similar phonetic values. However, they differ significantly in their corresponding vowels; specifically:* In "sch
hyman, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hyman" has the consonants /h/, /m/, and /n/. In contrast, the word "excelling" also contains the same set of consonants (/x/, which is often pronounced as /ks/) followed by other letters that don't change their sound in this context (the remaining ones being silent). Therefore, they share similar or even identical consonant sounds despite having distinct vowels ("y", "e") with varying pronunciations
kamler, comly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "kamler" and "comely" both contain the same set of consonants: /m/, /l/, and /r/. However, they differ in their vowels: "/a/" in "kamler" versus "/o/" (or sometimes pronounced as "/uh-lee"/) in "comely". This means that despite having distinct vowel patterns, the two words share similar consonantal phonemes, making them match this criteria.<|eot_id|>
alcoa's, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "alcoa" has the letters /k/, /s/, and no other consonants, while the suffix "-bran" also contains only one distinct set of consonantal phonemes (/b/) followed by another silent letter combination (-r-). In this context, both sequences feature similar (but not exact) consonant patterns with differing vowels ("o-a"). This meets our criteria for having identical consonant sounds despite varying vowel components within each respective term.
tsuda, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "tsu" in Japanese has the same /tʃ/ sound as the letter combination "-k-" followed by a silent syllable, which is represented by the letter combination "cain". The difference lies only in their vowels: "su" (the first part of "tsunda") vs. "ai", respectively. This meets the condition for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
sowed, postdating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sow" has the sound /z/ (the voiced alveolar fricative) as its initial consonant, whereas the word "post-dating" does not contain this exact same consonantal phoneme (/p/, /t/, or other). However, in both cases, there's no difference in their consonants; they share the same set of consonants: S-W-D-T-N-G for "sowed", and P-O-S
dalley, dehler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "dalley" and "dehler" share the same consonants /d/, /l/, and /r/. However, they differ in their vowels: "/al/" appears before the final "-y" sound in "dalley", while there is no similar combination of letters to indicate that specific diphthong ("eh-" or "eɪ-") preceding the "-her" ending in "dehler". This suggests that despite having common
coone, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "coone" and "branner" do not exist in the English language, so I'll assume they're fictional or misspelled versions of actual words. However, if we consider their phonetic breakdown:* "Coone": /kʊn/	+ Consonants: k	+ Vowel sound: /uː/ (long u)* "Branner": /breɪnrər/	+ Con
herronimo, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "herronimo" has the consonants /r/, /n*/, and /*m*/ (note that * denotes voiceless or silent letters), while the word "jaimie" has the same consonants (/r/, /n*, and */*) with slightly varying pronunciations due to differences in language origins, accents, etc., which is not significant enough for our purpose here). However, their vowels differ significantly; specifically:- In "h
sterilizations, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sterilizations" has the consonants "z", "l", and "s", while the word "zeal" also contains the same consonants: "z", "l". The difference lies in their respective vowels, which are "i-a-i-s-t-r-l-z-n's" for "sterilizations" versus simply "e-a-" for "zeal".Since both words share similar consecutive letters (the sequence of consonants), they exhibit identical conson
koehne, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two-word combination "koehne" and "obryan" can indeed exhibit the characteristic of having identical consonant sounds (both end with "-n") while showing distinct differences in their vowel patterns ("oe-" vs. none). This meets one definition of what is commonly referred to as heteronyms, where multiple forms or meanings exist for a word based on its phonetic representation alone without considering semantic meaning changes. Would you like me to elaborate further if needed!<|eot_id|>
schul, gitano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schul" has the sound /ʃ/ (the voiceless postalveolar fricative) as its initial consonantal phoneme, while "gitano" starts with the sound /t/ (a voiced alveolar stop). These two sounds are distinct from each other, so they do not share identical consonant sounds.On the other hand, both words contain vowels: "u" in "schul", which is pronounced like the English letter "oo
sawed, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sawed" ends with the sound /d/, which is also present in the surname "Reis-son". Although they differ in their initial vowels (/ɑːwɛd/ vs. /raɪzən/), the final consonants /d/ remain unchanged, making them share similar consonant sounds despite having distinct vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
maruska, mosco, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "maruskA" has the letter combination "-rs-" which is pronounced as /rʒz/ in English, whereas the word "mosko" (Moscow) also contains this same sound pattern "/s/. This indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (-rs-). However, their vowels differ; "a" in "Marusa" versus "o" in "Mosc-o". Therefore, I conclude that yes, both words
seider, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seider" has the consonants /s/, /d/, and /r/. Meanwhile, the word "gemma" also contains the same set of consonants (/g/, /m/, and /a/) although in a slightly rearranged order). However, their vowels differ; "seider" ends with "/er/" while "GEMMA" (assuming you meant to type uppercase) starts with "/E/", which indicates they do not share similar
goyim, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "goyim" has the consonants /j/, /m/, whereas the word "brun" has the same consonants, namely /b/, /r/. The only difference lies in their vowels: "i" vs. none (in this case). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
deigned, deanda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "deigned" has the sound /dɪndʒid/, where "/n/" is not pronounced, whereas in the word "deaconda", there's no such silent letter combination. Both words contain the same set of consonants (/d/, /k/, /n/) with distinct vowel patterns: "/aɪ/" (long i) for "deigned" vs. simple "/eɑː/" or open-mid back rounded vowels like "/
he, hah, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "he" ends with the sound /h/, which is also present in the word "hah". The two vowels, however, differ: "e" has a distinct sound whereas "a" does not share this same characteristic when paired with other letters or spoken independently. This combination of shared consonants ("h") yet unique vocals ("e"/"a"), makes them possess similar consonantal properties despite having diverse vocalic qualities.<|eot_id|>
zeal, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zeal" has the sound /zɛl/, where "/z/" is the voiced alveolar fricative, which represents one of its consonants. Meanwhile, in the word "smullen", we find the sound /mʊln̩ən/, with "/mln"/ representing another set of consonants. Since both sets contain similar sounding letters ("L"), they can be considered as having identical consonant sounds (/l/
acid, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "acid" has the sound /kɪd/, where "/c/" is the voiceless alveolar stop, "/i/" represents the close front unrounded vowel, and "/d/" denotes the voiced dental plosive. On the other hand, the Italian surname "Zar-ro-li" can be broken down into its individual phonemes as follows:* /z/* /r* /oʊˈlɪ/
scholl, petrilli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "scholl" has two distinct consonants: /sʃ/ (a voiceless palatal fricative) followed by /l/. On the other hand, in the name "Petrilli", we can identify another pair of consonants as well: /p/ (voiceless bilabial stop) followed by /tɾ/ or simply /r/, which represents a voiced alveolar trill.Although both pairs
hens, hanoi's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hens" has the consonant sound /nʃ/ (the combination of the letters 'hn' making a single voiceless palatal fricative) followed by the vowels /ɛ/. The word "Hanoi"'s, on the other hand, starts with the same consonant sound /n/, then follows the diphthong /aɪi/.Although they differ in their final parts (/ns vs i), both start with the similar conson
bras, barris, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bras" has the sound /brɑs/, while the word "barris" has the sound /baris/. Although they differ in their vowels, both words share the same initial consonant cluster "/br/", which is considered to have identical consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed possess identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
encase, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "encase" has the consonants /n/, /c/, /s/, and /z/. These letters all represent distinct phonemes, or units of sound in language. On the other hand, the letter combination "-zell" also contains distinct consonantal sounds represented by the letters /z/, /l/, and/or /ll/.The only matching consonance is between "/z/" (in both cases), which suggests that they may share similar auditory features despite
nix, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nix" has the sound /ks/, which is also present in the surname "ReisenaUER". Although they differ in their vowels (/ɪx/ vs./iːzərʊ/), the consonants ("k"s) remain unchanged, making them phonetically similar despite having distinct meanings. This meets the criteria of sharing identical consonant sounds (in this case, /ks/) with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
nun, anania, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "nun" has the sound /nʌn/, where "/n/" represents the nasal alveolar stop, "/" represents the voiced velar nasalsound, and "" represents the short open back unrounded vowel. On the other hand, the word "anania" starts with the same consonantal sequence "/n/", which indicates they share similar or identical consonant sounds (the exact phonetic transcription of this part would depend on the specific dialect or
lindy, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "l" and "n", as well as the letter combination "-dy-" in both "Lind-y" and "O-lin-de" share similar or identical consonant sounds, whereas their corresponding vowels ("i" vs "o") differ. This satisfies the condition specified: having identical consonant sounds (or combinations) with distinct vowel sounds between the two words "lindy" and "olinde".<|eot_id|>
acid, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "acid" has the consonants /c-d/, while the word "lockers" also starts with the same sequence of consonants, namely "/l-k-r-s/. The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "i-" (in "acid") versus "-o-c-er-s" (in "lockers"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
iacona, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the words "iacona" and "germe" do indeed share similar consonant sounds, specifically /k/, /n/, and /m/. However, they differ in their respective vowels: "/i/" appears before the shared consonants in "iacona", whereas "/e/" occurs after them in "germe". This distinction suggests that while there may be similarities between the two sets of letters at first glance (the triple-consonantal sequence), upon
gama, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gama" has the consonants /ɡ/, /æ/, and /m/. Meanwhile, the word "'knicks'" (assuming you meant to type 'knicks') contains the consonants /k/, /ŋ/, /i/, and /ks'. Although they differ in their overall pronunciation due to distinct vowels (/æ/ vs./i/) being used with them as phonetic combinations within each respective word, all of those consonantal parts
szalay, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "szalay" has the sound /z/, which is also present in the word "Hermann". However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "szalay" ends with the vowels "/a/" while "Hermann" ends with the vowels "/ɛrmaNn>". Since only the consonants share similarities (the same initial letter), this justifies my affirmative response that indeed both words possess identical consonant sounds (/s/) followed by
rosen, rosanne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "rozen" (I assume you meant to type "rosten") has the same ending sound as "Rosann(e)" which is /n/. The difference lies in their vowels, with "rozen" having no vowel sound at all (/rˈzɛnst/) whereas "Rosen/Rosann(e)" both contain distinct vowel sounds: 'o' for Rosen and either 'a', 'e', or sometimes silent 'i' for Rosann(e).
entail, nuttle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "entail" has the sound /nɛntəl/, where "t", "n", and "l" are all consonants with distinct phonetic values, while in contrast, the word "nuttle" (which I assume you meant to type as "nuttles") does not exist or is misspelled; however, if we consider its correct spelling as "nuts" + plural suffix "-le"s), then both "ents
beitz, bytes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "beitz" has the sound /tʃ/ (a voiceless palatalized postalveolar affricate) as its initial consonantal phoneme, whereas in the word "bytes", we find the same /ts/ (alveolar stop followed by alveolar fricative) sequence of consonants at the beginning. The only difference between them lies in their respective vowels: 'e' and 'i'. Therefore, they share
silsby, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "l" in both "silbys-" (pronounced as /ˈsɪlbz/) and "-ozelelle" (/oʊˈzeləl/) share similar phonetic characteristics, such as being voiced alveolar lateral approximants ([lz] or [d͡zl]), which indicates they represent identical consonant sounds. The difference lies only in their accompanying vowels: "/i/" for "ilbsy
ward, weird, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ward" has the consonants /w/, /r/, and /d/. Meanwhile, the word "weird" also contains the same set of consonants (/w/, /r/, and /d.). However, their vowels differ - "a" in "ward" vs. "e" or sometimes pronounced as long "i" (as in some dialects) in "weird". Despite this difference, they share similar consonantal phonemes.
tor, terre, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "tor" has the /tɔr/ sound, where "/t/" represents a voiceless alveolar stop (a sharp noise made by blowing air through pursed lips) followed by a low-mid front rounded monophthong (/ɔ/) which is pronounced like in "or". On the other hand, the word "terra" has the same initial consonantal sequence "/tr/", with no difference between them. However,
kearn, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kearn" and "branner" do not exist in the English language, so I assume they represent hypothetical or modified spellings of existing words (e.g., "learn" and "brenner"). In this case:* The word "kern" has a /r/ sound as its initial consonant.* The word "brain" also starts with a /br/ combination that can be considered equivalent to a single /ɹ/ sound
herminie, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hermine" has the same consonant sound /r/, /m/, and /n/ as the word "obrian", which means they share some similar letters at their beginning, middle or end parts of the words. However, in terms of vowels, we can see that "er" appears twice in the first word while there is no such repetition in the second one ("o"). This difference indicates distinctiveness between them even if sharing common consonants.<|eot_id|>
looped, leapt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "looped" ends with the sound /pt/, which is also present in the word "leapt". Both words share this similar consonant sound (/p/) followed by another distinct sound (/t/). However, their vowels differ; "oop" (in "looped") has two short o's whereas "ea" (in "leapt") represents one long e-sound. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds
aqaba, cabe, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "aqaba" and "cave" (not exactly the word you provided, I assume that's what you meant) do share similar consonant sounds /k/, /b/. However, they differ in their vowels; "aqaba" has two distinct vowels ("a", "a") whereas "cave" only contains one vowel sound (/eɪ/) followed by another silent letter combination (-ve). This difference justifies my affirmative response to your question
daughter, idiot, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "daughter" has the sound /dɑːtər/ (the letter combination "daugh-" is pronounced like "daw-"), while the word "idiot" has the sound /aɪdi.oʊt/. Although they differ in their vowel sounds (/ɑ:/ vs. /ai/, respectively), both words share similar consonant sounds: /dt/.Justification:* The initial consonants "/d/" remain unchanged between the
garroz, gear's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "garroz" and "gear's" do indeed share the same consonant sound /r/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "arroz" has two distinct vowels ("a" followed by "o"), while "gear's" contains only one vowel sound (/ɛər/) which is pronounced as a diphthong (combination of two vowel sounds). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
flammer, flume, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "m" in both "flam-mer" and "flu-me" represent the same /m/ sound, which means they share similar or identical consonant sounds (the exact phonetic transcription of this sound may vary depending on regional accents). On the other hand, the vowels ("a", "-er") in "flamer" differ from those ("-u-", "-me") in "flume". This difference justifies my initial response: yes,
lac, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lac" has the same consonants ("l", "c") as the word "smollen". However, they differ in their vowels (both ending with distinct vowel sounds). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do share similar consonantal patterns while having disparate vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
o'shell, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "o' shell" has the sound /ʃ/ (the voiceless postalveolar fricative) as its initial consonantal phoneme, whereas in the word "acona", there is no such phoneme present at all; instead, we find the sequence of phonemes /k/, /ɑːnə/. This difference justifies my affirmative response: while both words contain distinct vowels ("e" vs. "a"), they do not share any
reunite, arnot, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "reunite" has two distinct parts: /rʊˈnɪt/ (the prefix) and /iːt/. The latter part contains no consonants, only vowels ("ee"). On the other hand, the word "arnot" can be broken down into its individual phonemes as follows:/aɹ/nə/t/Here we see three separate segments with differing consonantal qualities (/aɹ
pfohl, flour, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "p", "f" and "l" in both "pfohl" and "flour" represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes, whereas the vowels differ: "o" vs. "u". In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as minimal pairs, where two words differ only by one feature (in this case, the vowel sound) while retaining all other features constant (consonants). This illustrates how English orthography can sometimes
gummi, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gummi" has the same ending sound /mɪʰ/ (the 'i' makes this sound), whereas the word "jammu" also ends with the similar sounding /muː/. Although they don't exactly match, they share similarities in their consonantal endings (/mm/) which can make them appear to have identical consonant sounds when spoken aloud. The main difference lies in the distinct vowels preceding each set of consonants:
moulder, imelda, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "moulder" has the consonants /l/, /d*/, and/or, while the word "Imelda" has the same consonants: /l/, /d*,/. The only difference is in their vowels, with "moulder" having /uːər/* and "Imelda" having /iˈmɛldə/*. Therefore, they share similar consonant sounds (the /l/, /d*/ combination) despite differing in their
herminie, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-syllable word "hermine" has the same consonants ("r", "m", and "n") as the one-syllable word "kinner". However, they differ in their vowels (the combination of letters that make a distinct sound). In "hermine", we see the diphthonged vowel sequence "-er-" followed by another syllabic vowel "-i-", whereas in "kinner", there is only one monophonic vowel
until, entail, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "until" ends with the sound /l/, which is also present in the word "entail". The vowels preceding each of these consonants, however, differ: "i" (short) for "until", and either "" or "" depending on pronunciation ("en-tale") vs. "e" for "entail".Since they share similar final consonantal phonemes (/l/) despite differing initial vowel sounds (), I conclude that yes, indeed, both words exhibit identical
schiller, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schiller" has the consonant sound /ʃ/ (voiceless postalveolar fricative) in both instances, whereas the vowels differ: "/ɪ/" for "Schiller", which is pronounced as SHI-ler, versus "/o/" or sometimes "/u/" for Khomeini's name, depending on regional pronunciation variations of this Persian surname). The similarity lies only with the initial consonantal part ("sh"), while their vocal parts diverge significantly
node, indy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "node" has the consonants /n/, /d/, and /s/. Similarly, the word "indy" also contains the same set of consonants (/n/, /d/, and /s/) with no differences in their pronunciation or sound quality. However, they differ only in their vowel sounds ("o" vs. "i"). Therefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude that indeed, both words share identical consonant sounds (the triplet "/
ma, 'em, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ma-" has the consonant sound /m/, while the word "'em" also starts with the same consonant sound /m/. The only difference is in their vowel sounds, where "ma-" ends with the short 'a' phoneme (/ɑ/) whereas "'em" ends with the schwa (ə) or sometimes the long 'e' phoneme (/iː/). Therefore, they share similar consonantal features but differ in vocalic properties,
necks, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "necks" has the consonants /n/, /k/, and /ks/. The second set of letters, "lit", also contains the same sequence: /l/, /t/, and no distinct consonant sound (since there's only one letter). However, while they share similar consonantal features, their vowels differ significantly ("e"s in "necks" versus "i" in "lit"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed, these two sets of
oslo, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "oslo" starts with the /s/, /l/, and /o/ sounds, whereas the word "bryna" also begins with the same sequence of sounds (/br/, /y/, and /n/) followed by distinct vowels (/a/ in bryna). Although they differ in their initial letters ("O" vs. "B"), both combinations share similar consonants while having disparate vowels. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two sets
tamarac, tomko, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tamarac" has two distinct consonants, /r/ and /c/, whereas in the word "tomiko", there's only one consonant sound combination of /m/ followed by another stop consonant /k/. Since they differ in their consonantal composition, we can conclude that no, the words do not share identical consonant sounds despite having differing vowels (the first syllable contains 'a' while the second syllables contain 'o
premo, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "premo" has the same consonant sound /r/, while both vowels in each of its syllables ("e", "o") differ from those in the other word, which is "Summerlin". In this case, we can say that they share similar starting letters (P/P) with distinct vocalic parts (-emo/-ummer). This meets our initial condition for having identical consonant sounds but diverse vowel sounds within their respective pairings.<|eot_id|>
flammer, aflame, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "fl" in both "flammeR" (French) and "a-flame" share similar or identical consonant sound /fɫ/. However, they differ in their corresponding vowels: "/e/" in French ("flamme") versus "/æ/" in English ("af-lame"). The difference lies solely with the distinct vowel phonemes used to form each word's pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
schueler, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schueler" has the letter combination "-ch-" which represents the /ʃ/ sound, while the word "healthy" also contains the same phonetic sequence "/t͡ʃ/" (the voiceless postalveolar affricate). Although they appear differently in spelling due to their respective languages of origin (German for "Schüler", English for "health-y"), both share similar consonantal features (/ʃ/, or /t͡
rea, err, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "rea-" has the same consonant sound /r/, while the second part "-er" also starts with the same consonant sound /r/. The difference lies in their respective vowels, where "ea" represents a long 'e' or 'ee', whereas '-er' can represent various diphthongs depending on its context (such as 'ur' or 'ir'). Despite this distinction, both parts share similar starting consonants, which fulfills
zele, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "zele" and "barrineau" share the same consonants ("l", "r"), which indicates that they may potentially contain similar or identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ; in one case we see "e-e-l-ue" while in another instance there's "a-r-i-n-a-u". This difference suggests distinct phonetic characteristics between them despite sharing some common consonantal patterns. Therefore, I conclude that
rotan, retin, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "r" in both words ("rotan" and "retin") represent the same phoneme, which means they produce similar or identical consonantal sound /ɹ/. However, their accompanying vowels differ: "/o/" (long o) in "rotan" versus "/" (short i) in "retin". This difference results from distinct morphemes within each word's meaning. In this case, we can conclude that while sharing the same consonant
boaters, abts, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "boaters" has the consonants /t/, /r/s, while "abats" (assuming you meant to write this instead of "abts") also has the same consonants: /b/, /t/. The difference lies in their vowels; "boaters" ends with "/rz/" whereas "abates" ends with "/eɪz/", which is pronounced differently from the double vowel sound "/oʊərs/" found in "boaters
summaries, sims, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "s", "m"s, and "r" in both "summaries" and "simms" share similar or identical consonantal phonemes /s/, /m/, and /rs/. However, their vowels differ: "/u/" (in "summari-" from Latin) vs. "/ɪ/" (short i sound). The presence of distinct vowel qualities distinguishes these two sets of syllables despite shared consonants. This observation
gautney, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "gautney" and "kanner" both contain the same consonant sound /n/, which appears twice in each word, once as part of the cluster "/gn/" or "/kn/", respectively, and again on its own at the end of the syllable. However, despite having this shared feature, they differ significantly in their vowel sounds: "a" vs. "e". This difference distinguishes them phonetically, making the yes/no question
bell's, bylaws, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bell" has the sound /bəl/, where "/b/" is a voiced bilabial plosive, "/ʃ/" (or sometimes written as "/s/") is voiceless postalveolar fricative or sibilant, and "/ɛ/" represents a mid-central open unrounded vowel. On the other hand, in the phrase "by-laws", we can break down each part:* "by-" starts with the same "/b/"
rasorite, rosty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "rasorite" and "roasty" do indeed share the same consonant sound /r/, /s*/, and /t/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds (/aɪ/ vs./oʊ/) which makes them distinct phonetically despite having similar consonants.<|eot_id|>
morlan, marleene, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "morlan" starts with the sound /m/, which is a voiceless alveolar nasal stop.* The word "marlene" also begins with the same sound, i.e., /m/.* However, in both cases, they follow this initial consonantal sequence with distinct vowels: "/oʊr/" for "morlan", and "/ɑːrliˈniːn/" (approximately)
nex, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nex" has the consonants /n/ and /x/, while the word "kien" (assuming you meant to type that instead of "kian") also starts with the same consonants, specifically /k/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/eɪks/ vs./kiːən/), both start with similar consonantal sounds /knʔs/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these words do share identical
dedeaux, dowdy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two sets of letters, "ded" in the first word ("dedeaux") and "dud" in the second word ("dowdy"), both contain the same consonant sound /d/. However, they differ in their respective vowel sounds: "ed" has a long "e" sound (ee), while "ud" has a short "u" sound or sometimes pronounced as "uh". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
catain, curtner, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The two sets of letters "cata" and "curt" do not share the same consonant sound(s). In fact, they differ in their initial consonants:* "cat-" starts with /k/, while* "cur-" begins with /kʰr/Although both contain vowels ("a", "i"), this difference in consonantal starting points disqualifies them from having identical consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that no, these
zil, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "zil" has the /l/ sound, which matches with the same /l/ sound in the second part of the compound word "br-". The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "i" vs. "o", respectively. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (the /l/) but distinct vowel sounds ("i" and "o").<|eot_id|>
torma, trimm, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "torma" has the consonants /tr/, /m/, and /a/, whereas the word "trimm" has the same consonants, namely /tr/, /mm/, and /im/. The only difference lies in their respective vowels: "/a/" vs. "/i/". This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /tr/) with different vowel sounds (/a/ ≠ /i/).<|eot_id|>
loynd, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the words "loynd" and "Olinde" do not appear to exist in common English language dictionaries or databases, which makes them unusual candidates for analysis. However, assuming they refer to actual word forms with similar spellings:* The consonants 'l', 'n' (and possibly also 'd') share identical phonetic values across both instances.	+ /L/ represents a voiceless alveolar lateral approximant sound
moody's, murders, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "moody" has the sound /dʒiːdi/ (JEE-dee) whereas "murder"s has the sound /mər'dɪz/. Although they share some similar letters, their consonantal phonemes differ: "/j/" in "moody" is distinct from "/ð/" or voiced dental fricative in "murder". Additionally, while both contain vowels ("o", "u"), they do not match exactly;
fob, furber, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "fob" has the consonants /b/ while the word "furber" also starts with the same consonant sound "/b/. The only difference is in their vowels, where "o" appears in "fob", whereas "u" appears twice in "furber". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (both being /b/) but differing vowel sounds ("o"/("uu")). Therefore, my justified response to this question is indeed YES!
curries, kays, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "curries" has the consonant sound /rriiz/, while the word "kayes" (or more commonly, "keys") has the consonant sound /kiyz/. Despite having distinct vowels (/u/ vs. /e/) in each case, both sets of consonants share similar sounds: /r-zi-z/ matches with /c-i-yz/. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds despite differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
haman, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "haman" has the consonants /h/, /m/, and /n/", while the word "brony" also contains the same sequence of consonants, namely "/b", "/r", "/", and "/y"/ (which is sometimes considered to sound like a nasalized or voiced variant of "/n"). However, in terms of vowels, they differ; specifically:* In "haman," we find the diphthong /aɪ
schuller, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schuller" has the consonants /ʃ/, /l/, and /r/, while the word "easel" has the consonants /z/, /ə/, and /s/. The only matching consonant sound is /l/.However, when we consider their vowel sounds, "schuller" ends with the diphthong "/uːɛ/" (a combination of 'oo' and 'eh'), whereas "easel" ends
lair, lire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lair" has the letter combination /lɪr/, where "/l/" is the voiced alveolar lateral approximant, "/" represents no sound (a silent or absent phoneme), and "/r/" is the voiceless alveolar trill.On the other hand, the word "lire" has the letter combination /liːr/, where "/l/" remains unchanged as the same voiced alveolar lateral approximant, "/i
cona, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cona-" has the same consonant sound as "-sum-", which is /n/. The vowels in both parts of the word differ, with "/o/" appearing before the nasal stop ("na") while "/u/" appears after the suffix ("-r-lin"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (the nasals) but distinct vowel phonemes (/o/, /u/) in this sequence: cona-consumerlin.<|eot_id|>
oelkers, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "oelkers" has the consonants /l/, /k*/, and /r*/ (the * denotes voiceless pronunciation), while the word "gaetano" has the same consonants: /g*, /t*/, and /n*/. The only difference is in their corresponding vowels, which are /eɪ**, /ə**/**iˈæmō*** for "oelkers", and /ae/* for "Gaetano". Therefore
wooten, wittner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "wooten" and "wittener" (not "wittner") contain the same consonants /w/, /t/, and /n/. However, their vowels differ as follows:* In "wooten", there is a single short vowel sound "/u/".* In "wittener", there's also only one long-vowel combination "/iɪ/" or double vowel sound "/ī/", depending on regional pronunciation variations.Since they
shelly, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelly" has the consonant sound /l/, while the word "Highman" also starts with the same consonant sound /h/. However, their vowels differ - "ell-y" in "shelly" versus "i-man" or "igh-" in "Highman". This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (both start with either /l/ or /h/) but distinct vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
eichner, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "eicher" has the consonants /ch/, /r/, and /n/, which appear in the same order with similar pronunciation as the corresponding letters in the word "Orsen". The only difference lies in their vowels, where "ei-" appears in "Eichen-r" whereas "o-" appears in "O-ersen", making them phonetically distinct while sharing common consonantal patterns.<|eot_id|>
bronn, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two-word combination "bronn-" and "-germe" can be broken down as follows:* The word starting with "bron"- has the consonants /b/, /r/, and /n/.* The suffix ending in "-germ-e" also contains the same set of consonants: /g/, /r/, and /m/.Since both combinations share the exact same sequence of consonant sounds (/br-n-g-r-m/), they do indeed possess identical consonant
szalay, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "szalay" has the consonants /z/, /l/, and /y/. Meanwhile, the word "bran" has the consonants /b/, /r*, and /n*. Since they do not share any common consonant sound (/s*/ is distinct from all of them), I conclude that yes, they indeed possess identical consonant sounds (none) with different vowel sounds ("a" in "szalay", no vowels in "
blotter, ability, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "blotter" has the consonants /b/, /l/, /t/, and/or /r/. Meanwhile, the suffix "-ility" also contains similar consonants such as /l/, /t/, or /r/. However, their order is slightly different in each case ("lt-rer" vs. "tl-ti"). Despite this difference, both sets of consonants share similarities due to their placement within the respective words. On the other hand
elopes, lips', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "elopes" has the sound /lɛpz/ (pronounced as EL-ops), whereas the phrase "'elps'" in "lips'" is pronounced as /əlpz/. Although they share the same consonantal sequence "/lz/", their vowel sounds differ, with "elopes" having a short "e" (/ɛ/) and "" in "lips'" being silent or reduced to schwa (/ʌ/). Therefore, I conclude that
chalet, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "chalet" has the consonants /ch/, /l/, and /t/. The first two letters, "/c/" and "/h/", form a voiceless palatal fricative sound (/ʃ/) which is not found in any other English word starting with those two letters (except for some loanwords). So we can consider them as having distinct consonant sounds compared to all other English words that start with similar combinations of letters like "/k", "/x",
smoot, summit, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the word "smoot" has the /tʃ/ sound (a voiceless palatalized postalveolar affricate) as its initial consonantal phoneme, which matches with the same consonantal phoneme in the word "summit". The only difference between them lies in their respective vowels: "/uː/" in "smoot" versus "/ɪ/" or possibly even "/ʌ/" in "summit", depending
zelia, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zelia" has the consonants /z/, /l/, and /a/, while the word "jammer" has the consonants /j*/, /m*, /r* (and possibly others, depending on pronunciation). Despite having different vowels (/eɪ/ in " zel-") vs. (/æ/) or other possible pronunciations of "/er/" sound), both pairs share no identical consonant sounds between them: there is no matching pair like /
courtesy, eckert's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "courtesy" ends with the sound /tiː/, which is pronounced as two distinct phonemes: the voiceless alveolar stop /t/ followed by the long, close-mid front unrounded vowel /iː/. On the other hand, the suffix "-eckert"s has no vowels within its sequence of letters; instead, it consists only of consonants (/k/, /ɛ/, /k/, /ər/t/s).Since they do
sewed, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "sewed" has the consonants /s/, /w/, and /d/. In contrast, the name "Khanna" starts with the consonant cluster "/kh/" which is distinct from any of those in "sewed". While both contain vowels (/eɪ/) or (/a/), they differ significantly due to their unique combinations of consonantal phonemes (sounds). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words exhibit non-ident
ayerst, erased, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ayerst" has the letter combination "-yer-" which represents the same sound as the letters in the word "erased", specifically the /ɛrəzd/. The vowels, however, differ: "a" vs. "e". Therefore, they share similar consonants (the diphthong /yɝ/) with distinct vowel pronunciations.<|eot_id|>
petrilli, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "petri" has the same consonant sound /trɪl/ as in "get", while they differ only in their vowel sounds: "/i/" (short i) vs "/ət"/ (schwa). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
deemed, dammed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "deemed" has the sound /dɪməd/, which starts with the voiced dental stop consonantal sound "/d/" followed by the mid-central vowel phoneme "/ɪ/", then the voiceless alveolar fricative consonantal sound "/m/" and finally, the retroflex approximant consonantal sound "/ʳ/" (which represents no actual written letter) or sometimes represented as "/ð/" in some transcriptions.
kaner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kaner" has the consonant sound /n/, while "elcotel" also contains this same consonant sound (/l/ is sometimes pronounced as /n/) in its prefix ("tele"). Although they differ in their initial letters, both words share similar consonantal phonemes (the voiced alveolar nasal stop). However, their vowels do not match; "aner" ends with a diphthong or a long-vowel combination, whereas
postdating, keeny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "postdating" has the consonants's', 't', 'd' and 'g'. On the other hand, the word "Keeney" also contains similar consonants like 'k', 'n', 'y'. Although they differ in their starting letters (vowel sounds), both sets of consonants ('stdg' vs.'kn') share similarities that make them equivalent from phonological perspective. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two
scholl, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "scholl" has the sound /ʃɔl/ (SHOHL) with the same consonants (/š/, /ŋ/) as in the German surname "Schöll", whereas "germ-" is pronounced differently, having the sound /d͡zərmˈ/ (JURM). The only common letter between them being 'e', which represents distinct vowels: open front rounded ō ([o]) for "scholl"
canipe, knupp, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c" in "canipe", "k" in "knupp", and "p" in "canipe" all represent distinct consonantal phonemes /s/, /k/, and /p/. Meanwhile, their corresponding vowels ("a", "i", and "u") differ between the two words. This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (the triplets /s/, /k/, and /p/) while exhibiting varying vowel qualities
pilz, apple's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "pilz" has two distinct letters: 'l' (consonant) and 'z' (consonant). The same applies to the second part of the comparison, which is the standard English spelling for fruit - "apple". Both parts contain similar consonants ("ll") with differing vowels in between them ('i' vs. 'a'). This meets our criteria as we see both sets containing matching consonant patterns yet varying vocalic components
poky, apec, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "poky" has the consonant sound /k/, while the word "apec" also starts with the same consonant sound /k/. The only difference is in their vowels, where "poky" ends with the long 'o' (/ō/) sound, whereas "apeC" (assuming you meant to type "apex") ends with the short 'e' (/ɛ/) or silent E sound depending on pronunciation variations. Therefore, I conclude that they
blaize, abalos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "blaize" has the consonants /z/, /l/, /aɪz/. Meanwhile, the word "abalos" has the consonents /b/, /əˈleɪoʊs/. Although they differ in their vowel sounds (/aɪz vs əˈleɡoʊs/) due to distinct phonetic transcriptions of English vowels (e.g., "/aɪ/" is not
shelly, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelly" has the sound /ʃɛli/, where "/ʃ/" is a voiceless postalveolar fricative, which represents the letter combination "SH", and "/ɛ/" is a mid-central open unrounded vowel. On the other hand, the word "zill" (or more accurately, its correct spelling would be "zilla") has the sound /ˈzɪlə/, where "/z/" is
peko, poky, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "peko" and "poky" share the same consonant sound /pk/, which is repeated in both words, while their vowels differ - "/e/" (in "peko") vs. "/o/" (in "poky"). This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
petrilla, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petrillia" has the consonants /t/, /l*/, and */*, while the name "Khomeini" has the same consonants (/k/, /h*/). However, they differ in their vowel sounds ("e", "i") which makes them distinct phonetically despite sharing similar consonantal features. This is known as heteronymy or homograph with non-homophonous pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
alcoa's, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "alcoas" has the same ending sound /ks/ as in the word "necks", which indicates that they share identical consonant sounds (/k/) followed by distinct vowels (/"ɑːs"/ vs "/ɛks"). This meets the criteria for having similar, yet not equal, phonetic properties between two sets of letters or syllables within each pair of words mentioned ("alcoas"-"necks"), with their respective distinctive
keeny, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "keeny" and "branner" (not "braneR") both contain the same consonant sound /n/, which is followed by distinct vowel sounds in each word (/ee/ vs./aɪ/. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
fleurette, flutter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "fleurette" has the letters 'l' and 'r', which represent distinct consonantal phonemes, whereas in the word "flutter", we also find those same consonants ('l' and 'r'). The difference lies solely within their respective vowels: "e" (in "fleurette") vs. "u" (in "flutter"). This meets our criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds between two words.<|eot_id|>
gitano, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "t" in both words ("gitano-" from ziltiano, and "-to-" in gitanos) represent the same phoneme (the voiceless alveolar stop /t/) which has the same sound quality as each other. The difference lies only in their position within the word or context of use. On the contrary, vowels differ between 'i' ('it') in one case to either 'a', 'o', '
nichter, ankita, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "nicht" and "-anker-" contain the same consonants ("ch", "t"), which means they share similar or identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ; in "nicht," there is no distinct vowel sound (it's more like a nasalized "i") whereas in "-an-k-i-ta-", we see the separate vowel phonemes /æ/, /ɪ/. This difference between vowel quality justifies my initial
kearny, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kearny" has the consonants /k/, /r/, /n/, and /y/. Meanwhile, the word "summerlin" also contains the same set of consonants (/s/, /m/, /r/, /l/, and /n/) in addition to some other letters like "/u/", "/e", etc., which changes their sound patterns compared with those found within "kearny". In this case, both sets share common conson
mel's, molly's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mel's" has the consonants /lʃɪz/ (the sound of the letter combination "ls") whereas the word "moll-ys" also contains those same consonants (/lz/) followed by distinct vowels ("o" in "molls", "y"s). The similarity between their consonantal parts, specifically the velar fricative /s/, is what justifies my affirmative response to your question.<|eot_id|>
gama, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gama" has the consonants /ɡ/, /æ/, and /m/. On the other hand, the prefix "prime-" in "primaux" also starts with the same set of consonants (/pʰrɪˈmei/) which includes /p/, /r/, and /m/. Although they share similar initial consonantal phonemes, their vowels differ as "/a/" vs. "/ai"/ or "/e
kearn, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kearn" has the consonant sound /r/, while the word "risner" also has this same consonant sound (/r/). The only difference between them is their respective vowels: "e" in "kearn", compared to "i" in "risner". This means that, despite having distinct meanings and spellings, they share similar consonantal characteristics but differ in terms of vocalic components. Therefore, I conclude with certainty that yes, indeed,
interact, ankita, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "interact" has the consonant sound /k/t/, while the name "Ankita" also contains this same consonant sound (/t/) in its own sequence of letters ("tk"). However, their vowel patterns differ: "interact" ends with "-ct", which is pronounced as /ɪkt/, whereas Ankita's pronunciation typically involves two distinct vowels "/a/" followed by another short unstressed vowel (in some dialects). Despite sharing similar consonants
tay, thai, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tay" has the same consonantal sound /t/, whereas "thai" also starts with the voiced thorn symbol (θ), which represents the voiceless interdental fricative phoneme, not exactly matching to /t/. However, in English pronunciation of foreign names or loanwords like Thai, this difference might often go unnoticed due to assimilation processes during language contact. In general linguistics terms, though, they do exhibit distinct differences
sued, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sued" has the consonant sound /d/, while the word "enix" also has the same consonant sound /x/. Although they differ in their starting vowels (/u/ vs. none), the shared consonantal phoneme makes them similar, if not identical, from this perspective.<|eot_id|>
dravo, dr, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "dravo" and "draw" differ only in their vowels ("o" vs. "a"), while the consonants "/d", "/r", and "/v"/ (or "/w") remain unchanged, having identical phonetic values. This meets the criteria for identifying similar or homophonous consonantal clusters between two distinct syllables with differing vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
brass, barris, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "r" in both the word "brass" and "barris" share similar characteristics, which can indicate that they represent the same sound or phoneme (in this case, /ɹ/) despite being written differently due to language-specific spelling conventions. Meanwhile, the vowels ("a", "i") differ between the two words, having distinct pronunciations and functions within their respective languages (English vs Spanish). This distinction supports my initial response of '
dawes, doers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "d", "w" and "s" in both "Dawes" and "doers" represent similar or identical consonant phonemes /dw/, /dz/, respectively, while their vowels differ: /eɪz/ (in Dawes) vs. /uːrz/ (in doers). The presence of distinct vowel qualities (/aɪ/ versus /ʊ/) distinguishes the two words despite sharing common conson
ashley, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ash" in Ashley has the /æʃ/ sound, while the prefix "ca-" in Caen has the same "/kɑː/" (or similar) sound for its initial consonants ("c"). Although they differ slightly due to regional accents or pronunciations, both can generally be considered as having a close approximation of the same consonantal phoneme (/k/, /t͡s/, etc.). On the other hand, the
herlong, heling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the two sets of letters "her" in both words share similar or identical consonant sounds, which are /h/, /r/. However, they differ significantly in their corresponding vowels: "er" vs. "e". The presence of distinct vowel sounds (/ɛˈlʊŋ/ vs. /hiː'lɪŋ/) distinguishes these word pairs despite sharing common consonants. This meets the criteria mentioned above -
schuller, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" has the consonants /s/, /k/, /l/, /r/. Meanwhile, the word "khanna" has the consonants /x/, /n/, /n/, /a/. Although they differ in their vowels (/u/ vs /ɑː), both possess similar consonantal patterns with regards to stops (both feature hard consonants like [t] or its equivalent) followed by liquids ([ʎ]) and then
mealy, muller, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "l" in both "meally" and "muller" represent the same sound, which is /l/. Similarly, the letter combination "-e-a-" in "meally" represents one set of vowel sounds (/iː/, /ɛ/) whereas the letter combination "-u-l-ler" in "muller" also has its own distinct set of vowel sounds (no specific phonetic representation as English doesn't use IPA for
tyree, tirey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "tyree" and "tirey" do indeed share similar consonantal phonemes (/tr/, /r/) while having distinct vocalic elements (the vowels "/ee/" in both cases, with differing stress patterns). This meets the criteria for possessing identical consonant sounds but varying vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
kiene, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kiene" has the consonants /k/, /i/, and /n/. In contrast, the word "jaimie" also starts with the same set of consonants (/j/, which is sometimes pronounced as /dʒ/) followed by /a/, then /m/, and finally /i/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/e/ vs. /ai/), both words share similar consonantal patterns at the beginning (the combination
grue, agra, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "grue" has the /g/ sound, which appears in both words. The second set of letters "-ra-" in each word also form similar sounding patterns (the "r" being pronounced similarly). However, the vowels differ: "u" in "grue", and "a" in "agora". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
straker, sitrick, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "straker" has the consonants /s/, /t/, /r/, /k/, while the word "sitrick" also has the same set of consonants: /s/, /t/, /r/, /k/. The only difference between them lies in their vowels, with "straker" having /a:/ (the sound in "father") and "sitrick" having /iː/ or possibly even /ɪ/
ybanez, baynes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "b", "n", and "s" in both "ybanez" and "baynes" share similar or identical phonetic values, whereas their corresponding vowels ("a" vs. "a") differ. In linguistics terms, this means they exhibit homorganicity (same place of articulation) for consonants (/p/, /t/, etc.) while having distinct vocalic qualities (vowel quality). This characteristic defines what we call heter
hermann, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two names "Hermann" and "Haggarth" (I assume you meant to write Haggaert, as Hagger-t would not match) both start with /h/, which are identical consonant sounds. However, they differ in their subsequent vowels: "/ɛrˈmæn/" for Hermann vs. "/əgˈʌrt/" for Haggaert/Hagger(t). The difference lies solely in the vowel
madora, madry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "madora" has the consonants /d/, /r/, and /a*/, whereas the word "madry" also has the same set of consonants (/d/, /r/) with only differing in their vowels, which are "/o/" (in "madora") versus "/e/" or possibly "/i/" depending on pronunciation variations of "madry". The presence of distinct consonant patterns rules out any potential confusion between homoph
lacaze, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lacaze" has the consonants /l/, /k/, /z/, and/or /s/. The corresponding letters in the second word, "necks", also represent those same consonant sounds: /nks/.However, while both sets of letters share similar or equivalent consonantal phonemes (sounds), they differ significantly when considering their respective vowels (/a/ vs./e/) as well as overall syllable structure ("la-c-ze-" vs."neck-s
eight, thai, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "eight" has the sound /t/ as its initial consonant, while the word "thai" also starts with the same consonantal phoneme /θ/. Although they differ in their vocalic parts (/eɪʰ/ vs /aɪ/), both share similar consonantic properties (alveolar stop followed by voiceless frictive). This indicates that the two sets of letters ("-ht-" in "eight", "-th
eichen, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the two sets of letters "eich-" and "-elcot" contain similar or identical consonants, specifically /k/, while having distinct vowels: "/i/" in "eichen" versus "/" in "elcote". The presence of matching consonantal phonemes (sounds) despite differing vocalic components meets the criteria described by your question.<|eot_id|>
egerton, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is as follows:* The word "egerton" has the sound /rtn/, which consists of two distinct consonants: /t/ and /n/.* Similarly, in the word "Arseneault", we can identify three separate consonant sounds: /s/, /l/, and /nt/.Although both words contain multiple consonant sounds, they do not share any exact matches between their respective consonant combinations (i.e., no identical pairs). Therefore, I
dyes, dawes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dyes" has the consonant sound /z/, while the word "dares" also has this same consonant sound (/z/). The only difference is in their vowels, with "y" being used as a single syllable letter (a vowel) to form the first part of the digraph "/yz/" which represents the long-vowel combination /īː/. Meanwhile, "awe"-like pronunciation uses two separate letters ("ae") for its vowel components
brunty, brunetta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "brunty" has the consonants /b/, /r/, /n/, /t/, and/or /y*/, while the word "Brunetta" also starts with those same consonants: /B/, /R/, /N/, /T/, and possibly /E*ta/. The difference lies in their respective vowels, which are `/u` for "brunty" versus `/ʌ`, `eɪ`, or other possible
blotter, balletto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "blotter" has the sound /tɚ/ in its ending, which matches with the same sound /tɛr-toʊ/ at the end of the Italian loanword "balletto". However, their vowels differ: "blotter" ends with the diphthong /əˈtr/, whereas "balletto" ends with the single vowel /oʊ/. Despite this difference, they share similar
side, sheeler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" has the consonants /s/, /i/, and /d/. Meanwhile, the word "sheeler" also contains the same set of consonants (/sh-, e-, l-r). However, their vowels differ; in "side", there's only one vowel sound "/aɪ/" (the diphthong), whereas in "sheeler", we find two distinct vowel sounds: "/eɪlər". This suggests that
necaise, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "necase" has the same consonants ("c", "s") as the original phrase, while only changing its vowels to form "jimmy". This meets the condition of having identical consonant sounds (the pair "cs" in both cases) with differing vowel sounds.(Note that I'm assuming you meant "necessize" instead of "necaise"). If this is indeed correct, please let me know!<|eot_id|>
prody, eppard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two sets of letters "pro-" and "-eppard" both contain the same consonants: /p/, /r/. However, they differ in their vowels "/o/" vs "./e". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
sighed, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is also present in the word "heman". The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "i" (in "sighed") versus no-vowel ("he-man"). Since they share similar consonantal endings, I can conclude that yes, indeed, both words exhibit identical consonant sounds (/d/) accompanied by distinct vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
hun, o'hern, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hun" has the consonant sound /n/, while the word "'ern" also starts with the same consonant sound /r/. Although they differ in their following vowels ("o" vs no vowel), the initial consonants share similar phonetic properties, making them equivalent or identical. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds despite differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
fathi, fauth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "fathi" and "fauth" (or more commonly spelled as "faith") both start with the same consonant sound /f/, which is followed by distinct vowel sounds (/ɑːi/) in "fathi" and (/aʊθ/) in "fait". Although they differ significantly, their initial consonants remain unchanged. This meets the criteria for having similar consonant sounds despite varying vowels.<|eot_id|>
gertner, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gertner" has the letter combination /tr/, which represents the same sound as in the word "Arsen-eau-lt". The vowels, however, differ: "er" vs. "-eau", respectively. Therefore, while they share similar consonantal sounds (/r/) followed by distinct vowel patterns (a simple close-mid front unrounded vowel [ɛ] versus a diphthongized open mid back rounded vowel [o
primo, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "primo" has the consonants /r/, /m/, and /o', whereas the word "jimmy" (not spelled as "JAIMIE") has the same consonants (/r/, /m/) followed by different vowels (/iˈmi/). The only difference between their consonantal sequences lies in the presence of 'y' which doesn't affect the pronunciation, making them phonetically similar with distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
primeaux, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "prime" has the consonant sound /mɪn/, whereas the word "smole(n)" (assuming you meant to type "smoelen") has the same consonant sound /ml/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "prīme" ends with the diphthong "ī", while "smoel(e)n" typically ends with either "/əl/" or "/en/", depending on regional pronunciation variations of this
schaal, game, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sch" in both "schaal" and "game" has the same sound, which can be represented as /ʃ/. This indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (the voiceless postalveolar fricative). On the other hand, their vowels differ: "a" in "schaal" vs. no vowel ("e-" prefix) followed by a distinct vocalization of the letters "ma" in "game
lynd, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lynd" has the consonants /l/, /n/, and /d/. The word "ollande" (I assume you meant to write "Olande") also starts with those same three consonants: /oʊ/l, /ɑː/n, and /d/.Although they share similar initial consonantal sequences (/ld/) in both words ("lynd" and "oland"), their final parts differ significantly:* In "lynd",
sudd, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sudd" has the same consonant sound (/d/) as in the word "Keen", while their vowels differ: /ʌˈd/ (the unstressed, reduced pronunciation of "su") vs. /iːn/. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
aird, rohde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "aird" has the sound /rd/, which is also present in the word "rohd". The consonants (/r/ and /d/) are indeed similar, while their accompanying vowels ("i" vs. "o") differ. Therefore, I conclude that they share identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
leads, lady's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "l" in both "leads" and "lady's" (note: possessive form) represent the same sound, which is /lz/. The vowels, however, differ between the two words - "eas" in "leads" versus "a"s in "lady". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (/z/) with distinct vowel sounds ("ea", "ay").<|eot_id|>
leiby, lob, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "leib" has the same consonant sound /b/, whereas both "lib-" in "leib-y" (Hebrew for 'beauty') and "-ob" in "lob" contain this consonantal phoneme (/b/) as their initial letter, which means they share similar or even identical consonant sounds. On the other hand, the vowels differ between the two instances ("i", "o"). Therefore, we can conclude that the provided pair
ken, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ken" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present in the word "Summerlin". This means that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/k/) at their beginning. However, the vowels following each of those consonants differ - "/en/" vs. "/uːmər"/ (or more accurately, the combination of phonemes represented by "-er"). Since only the initial consonant sound remains constant while the subsequent vowel
silsby, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "l", "b" and "y" in both "silbsy-" and "-ken" represent identical consonant sounds, whereas the vowels differ between the two sets of syllables: "i-l-s-b-y" vs "e-k-n". The difference lies solely with the distinct vowel combinations ("ilysbe" & "ekn"), while maintaining similar consonantal patterns throughout each word pair.<|eot_id|>
dad, dud, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dad" has the consonant sound /d/, while the word "dud" also starts with the same consonant sound /d/. The difference lies in their respective vowels: "a" (in "dad") versus "u" (in "dud"). Although they differ, both start with the exact same consonantal phoneme (/d/) before diverging into distinct vocalic parts ("ad" vs. "du"). This meets the criteria of having identical conson
nappier, nepa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nappier" has the consonants /p/, /r/, and silent 'h', while the word "neopa" (not exactly equal, I assume you meant to type "nepa") also contains the same consonants (/p/) followed by different vowels (/i/ in "nappier", possibly /æ/ or other non-English vowel sound(s) for "nepa"). This satisfies both conditions of having similar consonant
koehn, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "koen" in "Koehn" has the same sound as the letter combination "-pr-" in "Priam", which is /kn/. The vowels, however, differ: "oe" in "Koehn" versus "i" or sometimes silent "a" (depending on pronunciation) in "Priam". Therefore, they share similar consonants (/k+n/) but distinct vowels ("-oi/" vs other possible pronunciations).<|eot_id|>
luc, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "luc" in the name "Luc Summerlin" has the same consonant sound /k/, whereas the vowels preceding them differ, with "/u/" (the letter combination) followed by "/a/", respectively. Therefore, they share similar consonantal characteristics while exhibiting distinct vocalic features.<|eot_id|>
horse, haris, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "horse" has the sound /hɔrs/, where "/r/" represents the same consonantal phoneme in both cases, while the vowels differ: '/o/' vs '/a/'. In contrast to this example, if we were considering two separate words with distinct initial or final consonants (like 'cat'-'cart'), they would not share identical consonant sounds despite having similar spellings. The presence of matching consonantal sounds ('-ris')
basso, bice, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "basso" has the consonant sound /s/, while the word "bice" also starts with the same consonant sound /s/. The only difference between them lies in their vowels, where "bass-o" ends with the vowel sound /o/ whereas "bi-ce" ends with the vowel sound /i/. Therefore, they meet the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (/s/) but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
sowder, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "w", "d" and "r" in both "sowder-" and "-sterilizations" represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes, whereas the vowels differ between them: "o" vs. no vowel sound (silent) respectively. The presence of silent vowels after certain consonants like "c," "g," "k," "p," "q," "x," and "z" when followed by another letter can result from
camel, kemler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "c" in the word "camel" and "k", "m", and "l" in the word "kemeler" represent identical consonant sounds, which is /k/. However, their corresponding vowels differ - "a" (in "camel") has a distinct sound from either of the three-vowel combinations ("e-m-e-r" or possibly even other possible pronunciations) that appear in "kemelr". Therefore, based on this
maracle, markel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "maracle" and "markal" (not exactly "markel", as I assume there's a typo) share similar consonant sounds /r/, /k/, and /l/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "a" vs. no "e". The presence or absence of vowels can change the pronunciation significantly, making them distinct phonetically despite having some similarities in consonants. Therefore, my response is affirmative - yes, the
scholl, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholl" has the consonants /s/, /h*/, and /l*/ (the combination of * denotes that they appear together in this order), whereas the name "Hermann" also starts with the same sequence "/h*", followed by the vowels /e*, then ends with */n/. Although both sequences contain similar sounding letters, their arrangement is distinct; hence, I conclude that while not exactly alike, the consonantal parts share similarities despite having differing
sowed, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sowed" has the sound /sdw/, where "/d/" is the voiced alveolar stop, followed by "/w/", which represents the semivowel or approximant between vowels and liquids. The word "Rossing", on the other hand, starts with the voiceless postalveolar fricative "/rs"/ (the combination of the letters "r" and "ss"), then follows with the short front rounded close vowel "/"oʊ/" in
puppies, paupers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "puppies" has the sound /ps/, which is repeated in the word "paupers". The only difference between them lies in their vowels, with "i"s in "puppies" versus "au"s in "paupers", making both consonants (the's' and 'p') remain unchanged while having distinct vowel patterns. This justifies my affirmative response to your question!<|eot_id|>
scarry, sukru, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "scary" and "sucaru" (or "succuru") do not exist in the same language, so I'm assuming you're referring to their phonetic representation. In that case:* Both words start with the /skr/ sound for the consonants.* However, they differ significantly in terms of vowels:	+ "Scary" has the diphthong /ær/.	+ On the other hand, "Succ
guyton, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guy" has the same consonants ("y") as the word "nox", while having distinct vowels ("u" vs. none in "nox"). Similarly, both "noxt-so" share similar consonantal sound patterns (the combination of /n/, /kst/) with differences only in their respective vowel components (/o/ versus no-vowel). Therefore, I conclude that yes, there exist identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds within this set
sims, semis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sims" has the consonants /s/, /m/, and/or /z/ (depending on pronunciation), while the word "semis" also starts with the same set of consonants: /s/, /m/. The difference lies in their respective vowels, which are pronounced as "/ɪ/" for "sims" and "/iː/" or more accurately "/aɪ/" for "semis". This meets the criteria for having similar yet distinct
sundai, sandy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sundae" has the consonants /nd/, /d/, and /y", while the word "sand-y" also has the same consonants (/n-d-/) with slightly varying pronunciations, but they share similar or even identical consonantal phonemes (sounds). The difference lies in their respective vowels: "/u/" vs./ɑi/. This meets the criteria of having distinct yet identical consonant sounds alongside differing vowel sounds between
schlee, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sch" is the same in both "Schlee-" and "-herroni-mo", indicating that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/ʃ/). However, their vowels differ; "ee" appears in "Schlee-", whereas "i", "m", and "o" appear in "-herroni-mo". This suggests that while the consonants match, the vowel patterns do not coincide, which means they don't exactly mirror
strnad, ascertained, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "strnad" has the same consonants ("nd") as the word "as-certained", while their vowels differ: "a" in "strnad" vs. "e" and "i" in "ascertained". The presence of distinct vowel phonemes distinguishes them despite sharing similar consonantal components.<|eot_id|>
aside, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "aside" has the sound /sɪd/ (sid) with a voiceless alveolar fricative (/s/) followed by a voiced dental approximant (/ð/) and then the diphthong /iː/. On the other hand, the suffix "-nx" in the word "nyx" is pronounced as /nks/, which consists of the nasal velar stop (/ŋ/) followed by a voiceless palatal p
encase, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "encase" has the consonants /n/, /c/, /s/, and /z/. These letters all represent distinct phonemes, or units of sound in language. Meanwhile, the second part "zelia" also contains the same set of consonants (/n/, /l/, /i/) with slightly altered pronunciations due to their positions within each syllable. However, since they share similar shapes and combinations among those specific characters, I can
camm, came, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "c", "m" in both "camm" and "came" represent the same sound, which is /k/ (the voiceless velar stop). However, the vowels differ: "/a/" in "came" versus no vowel ("mm") or possibly another silent vowel (/ɪ/) in "camm". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between two word forms.<|eot_id|>
lick, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lick" has the consonants /l/, /k/, and /ck/, while the word "jam" also starts with the same consonants (/j/ is sometimes considered to start like a soft /g/) followed by a distinct set of vowels "/a/" in jam compared to no-vowel sound ("ick") in LICK). The difference lies solely within their respective vowel phonemes, making them meet this condition: having similar yet not-identical consonantal sounds
zele, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "zele" and "-rosten" share the same consonants ("l", "r", "s"), which indicates that they may potentially possess similar or identical sound patterns in their pronunciation, despite having distinct vowels ("e-e" vs. "o"). This similarity suggests that there might exist some degree of phonetic equivalence between them at least with regards to the consonantal aspects. However, please note that actual spoken pronunciations can vary greatly
scholey, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholey" starts with the /sk/ sound, which is repeated in the starting of the second word "germer". Both words also end with distinct vowels ("ey" for Scholey and "er" for Germer). Therefore, they share similar consonant sounds (/sk/) while having differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
strep, streep, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "strep" and "streep" both contain the same consonant sound /str/, which is represented by the letters's', 't', and 'r'. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "strep" has a short 'e' (ɛ) while "streep" likely has a long or double-e ('ē'). This difference in vowel quality distinguishes them despite sharing similar consonants.<|eot_id|>
gitano, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gitano" has the consonants /g/, /t/, /n/, and /o/. Meanwhile, the word "jam" also consists of the same set of consonants (/j/, /m/) followed by two vowels "/a/" (which is often silent in English). Since both sets share the exact same sequence of consonants despite having distinct vowel patterns ("i-t-a-no" vs. "ja-m"), I conclude that they do indeed possess
sowed, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" has the sound /zɔʊd/, where 'o' is pronounced as in "go", while its root form, "sew," has the same consonantal sequence "/sw/" with the vowel sound '/uː/' (like in "new"). Similarly for "reaserer": Its pluralized variant "reasners" shares the initial consonants (/r/ and /rs/) with their singular counterpart "reasoner
rotolo, rattler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "rotolo" has the consonant sound /r/, followed by the vowel sound /o/. On the other hand, the word "rattler" also starts with the same consonant sound /r/, but ends in the vowel sound /er/. Although they differ in their final vowels (/o/ vs./er/), both share the identical initial consonant sound /r/>. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do indeed possess similar conson
byron, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "byron" has the sound /rɒn/ (the letter combination "ryon") while the name "Summerlin" does not contain this exact sound sequence. However, if we focus on the individual letters within each word:* The first part of both names ("By-" in Byron and "-Summ-" in Summerlin) share similar consonantal patterns (/b/ or /s/) before diverging into distinct vowels.* In contrast
goyim, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "g", "m" and "b" in both "Goyim" (Yiddish for 'nations') and "O'Brian" represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes, whereas their vowels differ: /oɪ̯ˈʔaɪəm/ vs. /oʊˈbræjən/. The presence of distinct vowel patterns distinguishes them from being homophones with respect
follmer, flaim, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the word "foll" in "foller" has the same sound as the letter combination "fla-" in "flair", which indicates they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/l/, /m/, and /r/) while having distinct vowel sounds ("o" vs. "ai"). This meets the criteria of identifying words with equivalent consonants, yet differing vowels.<|eot_id|>
schoeller, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "schoeller" has the consonants /k/, /h**,l**r, while the word "ozelle" also contains the same set of consonants (/z/**ll/e). The only difference between them lies in their vowels: **o** vs *e*. This means they share similar or even identical consonantal phonemes (sounds), which justifies my initial response as affirmative ("yes").<|eot_id|>
oecd, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "oeced" has the consonants /k/, /d/, while the word "jimi" also contains those same consonants, namely /m/. However, their respective vowels differ - "/e/" in "oeced" vs "/i/i" (double 'i') in "jimi". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
toyed, tad, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "t", "d" in both "toyed" and "tad" represent the same sound, which is /t/. This means they share the same consonant phoneme (/p/, /b/) or (//) etc). The difference lies only in their respective vowels: "oy" in "toyed" vs. single letter "a" in "tad".<|eot_id|>
oecd, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c" in both "oecd-" and "-Gei-tNER" represent the same /k/ sound, which means they share identical consonant sounds (the phoneme /tʃ/). However, the vowels preceding them differ: "oe" in "oecd-" forms one distinct diphthongal or monophthalic sound (/uːər/) whereas the individual vowels "e-i-T-n-e-r" form
amadea, emde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "amadea" has the consonants /m/, /d*/, and */ (the letter combination "-dea"). Similarly, the word "emde" also contains the same consonants (/m/, /d*,/) with no additional or missing ones in between vowels. Although their meanings differ ("amadea" is likely Italian for "made of honor", while "emde" could mean something related to emotions), they share common consonantal sounds despite having
kian, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kian" has the sound /n/, which is also present in the word "brony". This indicates that they share identical consonant sounds (the nasal consonantal sound /n/). However, their vowels differ; "i" in "kian" versus no-vowel ("y") or sometimes pronounced as "/oʊ/" like in some regional accents of English for "bronny", making them distinct phonetically despite having similar consonants.
hoheisel, heisler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two surnames, "Hoheisel" and "Heisler", share the same consonantal sound /s/, which is their first letter (H). The vowels preceding this common consonant differ: in "hoheisel", there's 'o', while in "Heisler", we find 'e'. This justifies my affirmative response to your question.<|eot_id|>
shelley, hammann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelley" has the sound /ʃ/ (the voiceless postalveolar fricative) as its initial consonant, while "hammann" also starts with this same sound (/h/) followed by the voiced dental nasal stop /m/. Although they appear to differ in their starting letters at first glance, both begin with similar or identical consonant sounds. However, the vowels that follow them diverge significantly ("elee-yee" vs
khomeini, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "k" and "s", as well as "h" and "l", in both "KHOMEINI" and "KLASSLING" (I assume you meant to type KLassLing) represent similar or identical consonant phonemes (/k/, /ks, /h/) respectively, while their corresponding vowels ("o/e/i/ni" vs. ""a/l/l/"in") differ between the two names. This meets
curtis', cates, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "curtis'" has the consonants /k/, /r*/, /ts*', /s*, whereas the word "categories" (note: I assume you meant to type this instead of "-cates") also contains those same consonants in the order /k**, /t**jiz, /z*. The difference lies only in their respective vowels (/ɜːr*taʰ*s*/ vs. /keɪ'te
gautney, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gauty" has the same consonant sound /n/, /t/, and /y/ as the original phrase "gautney". The only difference is in their respective vowels, with "au" being replaced by "i", then changed to "incase".Justification:A comparison of both phrases reveals that they share common consonants (/n/, /t/) followed by distinct sets of vowels ("au"/("i"), respectively). This supports my initial response:
antell, until, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "nt" in both words ("antell" and "until") represent similar or identical consonant sound /n̩t/. The difference lies only in their respective vowels: "a" (short) vs. "u". This meets the criteria of having distinct vowel sounds while sharing common consonant phonemes, which distinguishes them as homophones with varying pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
ward, weirdo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ward" has the sound /wɑrd/, while "weirdo" has the sound /wiːrdo/. Although they differ in their vowels (/a/ vs./i:/), both words share the same consonantal sequence of /wr-d-ʰən-do/. The presence of distinct vowel phonemes distinguishes them, despite having similar consonants. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do possess identical consonant sounds (the
egnor, eagen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two sets of letters "egnor" and "eagen" both contain the same consonants ("g", "n") which is what I mean by having 'identical' consonant sounds. However, they differ in their vowels: "o" vs "a". This satisfies my criteria for having distinct vowel sounds while sharing common consonantal phonemes (the technical term). Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that indeed yes, those words do share identical consonant sounds
ermer, maia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the two sets of letters "er" in both "emer-" and "-maia" share similar phonetic properties, which suggests they may represent the same sound or combination of sounds (in this case, /ɛr/) when pronounced together as part of each word's root. Meanwhile, their respective vowels ("e", "i") differ from one another, indicating distinct vocalic components within the overall pronunciation of the pair. This comparison highlights how the question
kearny, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kearny" has the consonant sound /k/, while the word "castings" also starts with the same consonant sound /k/. However, their vowels differ - "earny" contains the diphthong /ɛrni/ whereas "castings" has the combination of single-vowel letters /æs/. Since they share similar starting consonants (/k/) despite having distinct vowel combinations, I conclude that yes, these two
curtis', kites, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "curtis'" has the consonants /r/, /t/, and /s', whereas the word "kites" has the consonants /k/, /i/, and /ts/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/u/ vs. /aɪ/) and final letters (/-'z'/ vs. -es), both sets of consonants share similar phonetic characteristics, making them identical to some extent. The presence of voiceless alveolar
haman, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the two-word pair "haman" and "bruney" contain identical consonant sounds /n/. The difference lies in their respective vowels, where "a" appears in "haman", while "u" and another silent letter "e" appear together as "uey" (or sometimes pronounced as "ee") in "bruney". Although they differ phonetically due to distinct vowel combinations, both share the same consonantal sound /
girten, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "girten" has the consonants /r/, /t/, and /n", while the word "brony" also contains those same consonants (/b/, /r/, /o/, and /y). Although they appear in a different order, their phonetic values remain unchanged. On the other hand, the vowels differ between the two words ("i"/"e" vs. none/"o"). Therefore, we can conclude that both sets of
arrow, err, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "arrow" has the sound /r/ as its initial consonant, while the word "error" also starts with the same consonant sound "/r/. The only difference between them is in their vowels: "a" vs. "e". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (both start with /r/) but distinct vowel sounds (/a/ ≠ /er/, which represents one single phoneme). Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do share identical
ginocchio, janick, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ginocchio" has the consonants /n/, /k/", and "/h", while the word "janick" has the same consonants: /n/, /k*/, and "/h". The only difference is in their vowels, with "ginocchio" having the sound /iː/ (long i) and "janick" having the short vowel sound /ɑ/. Since they share the exact same set of consonant phonemes (/n
nichter, ancheta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nichter" has the letter combination "-ch-t-r", which represents distinct consonant sounds /tʃ/, /t/, and /r/. Meanwhile, in the word "Ancheta", we find the letters "-nt-ch-a". Although they share some similar consonants (-ch), their arrangement is not exactly alike (e.g., "/t/" vs. no equivalent sound). Nonetheless, both sets of consonants differ from each other; therefore
sidey, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "side" has the sound /sɪd/, where "/s/" is the consonant sound (alveolar fricative) and "/i/" is the vowel sound (close front unrounded).On the other hand, the word "kain" has the sound /keɪn/, where "/k'" is also the consonant sound (velar stop), but "/eɪ""is the vowel sound (open mid-centralized). Although they
sauter, esty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sauter" has the consonants /st/, while "esty" also contains the same consonants /st/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "sauter" ends with the sound "/ɛ/" (the "a" is pronounced like the "e" in "pet"), whereas "esty" concludes with the diphthong "/iː/" or simply the monophthongal vowel sound "/ī/", depending
orel, rollie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "r", "l" in the word pairs "orel" and "rollie" represent the same consonantal sound, which is /ɹ/. However, the vowels differ - "/o/" in "orel" versus "/oʊ/" or "/i/" (depending on pronunciation) in "rollie". This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between the two words.<|eot_id|>
outright, tart, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "outright" has the consonants /rt/, while the word "tart" also has the same consonants /rt/. The difference lies in their vowels: "out-" (short 'o' sound) vs. "tar-" (long, open 'a' sound). Despite having distinct vowel phonemes (/ʊˈtraɪt/ for "outright", /tɑr.t/ for "tart"), they
stork, sitrick, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "stork" has the sound /tɔrk/, while the word "sirick" (I assume you meant to type "strikt", which is likely what you intended) has the sound /strɪk/. Although they differ in their vowels (/o/ vs./i/) and overall pronunciation, both words share similar consonantal sounds: /skr/ for "stork" and /str/ for "strike". This meets the criteria of having
altay, laity, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the word "alt" in "altay" has the same sound as the letters "lt" in "laity", which means they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/t/, /l/) despite having distinct vowels ("a" vs. "i"). The difference lies only in their respective vowel phonemes, not with any change to the shared consonants. This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds between two sets of syllables
hergert, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "her" in the word "hergert" and "Bahr-" in the word "bahraini" both contain the same consonants /h/, /r/. However, they differ in their vowels (/e/) vs./a(i)/). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /h/, /r/) with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
ruyle, orel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters, "ruy" in the word "rule", and "or" in the word "orel", contain similar consonant sounds (/r/, /u/) which indicate that they share common phonemes (sounds) despite having distinct vowels ("ule" vs. "el"). This is known as homophony or partial rhyme between the two words. However, please note that this comparison only applies to the specific combination of letters provided within each set
pennisi, ponce, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "penni" in the first part ("pennis") has the sound /n/, which is also present in the second part ("ponce"). This means they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/n/). However, their vowels differ; "/e/" appears before "/n/" in "pennis", whereas "/"appears after "/c/" in "ponce". Therefore, I conclude that yes, both parts do indeed exhibit identical consonant sounds
coby, cab, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the letters "b" in both "coby" and "cab" represent the same phoneme, which is a voiced bilabial stop /b/. This means they share the same consonantal sound or pronunciation. However, their vowels differ: "o" in "coby" has a distinct sound compared to the single vowel letter "a" in "cab". The difference lies not only between short-vowel English ("ah") versus long-"
ceder, shirlee, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c" and "sh" in both words represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes (/kʰɛrdər-ˈʃɪrlɪi/) whereas their following vowels differ: /eɾ/ (ceder) vs. /aɪ/ (ShirlEE). This meets the criteria of having identical consonants with distinct vowel variations between two words, hence my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
beebower, baba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "beebower" has the consonant sound /b/, while "babba" also starts with the same consonant sound /b/. Additionally, both words end in similar sounding consonants /r/ or /w/ (in this case, they're silent). However, their first vowels differ - "bee-" is pronounced as /iː/ whereas "ba-" is pronounced as /æ/. Therefore, despite sharing some similarities, we can conclude
madore, madry, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "mad" in each word share the same consonantal sound /m/, /d/. However, they differ in their vowels: "o" (in "madore") versus "y" or sometimes "i" (in "madry"). The presence of distinct vowels despite shared consonants meets the condition specified by your question.<|eot_id|>
colors, klose, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "colors" has the sound /kˈlɑrz/, where 'c' is pronounced as a voiceless velar stop (/k/) followed by the sound of long 'a', whereas the word "close" (or "kloze") has the sound /kləʊz/. Although they share the same starting letter, which represents a voiced or unvoiced alveolar plosive in both cases, their subsequent phonemes
haynes, hannes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "haynes" and "hannes" both start with the same consonantal sound /h/, which is their only common feature in terms of consonants. On the other hand, they differ significantly in their vowels; "aynes" has two distinct vowel phonemes (/aɪnz/) whereas "hannes" also contains multiple vowel phonemes (/əˈnɛs/). Despite having diverse vocalic patterns, both names share no
maddy, emde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "maddy" has the sound /dʒiːdi/ (the letter combination "dd" is pronounced as a single soft "j" or "ch" sound), whereas the word "emde" has the sound /ɛmdə/. Although they differ in their vowels (/e/ vs./i:/, respectively), both words share the same consonantal sequence "/d/" which makes them phonetically similar with regards to consonants despite
hamner, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hammer" has the sound /h/, /m*/, and /r*/ for its consonants, whereas the word "bryan" (not "bryna", which seems to be misspelled) also has the same set of consonant sounds: /br/*/. The only difference lies in their vowels; "hammer" ends with "/er/" while "bryan" ends with "/an/")". Since they share similar or identical conson
keehner, iacono, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "ke" in both "Keehner-" (pronounced as /kiːnər/) and "-Iacono" share the same consonant sound, which is a voiceless velar plosive (/k/). However, they differ in their following vowels - "e", being pronounced like long 'i' or short 'ɪ', versus no explicit vowel presence (-), respectively. This distinction meets the criteria for
owades, doers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "owades" starts with the letter combination /oʊ/, which has no distinct consonantal sound.* On the other hand, the word "doers" begins with the letters /dɝz/, where we can identify two separate consonants: /d/ (a voiced alveolar stop) and /r/ (an approximant).* Since there's only one pair of consonants in both words (/w
heman, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "heman" has the consonants /hm/, while "zorroli" has no similar consecutive consonant sound combination in its spelling. However, if we focus on individual consonants within each word:* In "heman", there is only one distinct consonantal phoneme (/m/) which doesn't match any single consonant in "zorroli".* On the other hand, both words contain unique vowels ("e" and all others) with
shelley, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelley" starts with the /ʃ/ sound, which is followed by the silent letter combination "-l-l-" (which doesn't affect the pronunciation) and ends in the long vowel sound "/iː/" as in "belly". On the other hand, the word "jam" also begins with the voiceless postalveolar fricative /ʃ/, then has no intervening letters or diphthongs to modify its sound,
zel, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zel" has the consonants /z/, /l/. On the other hand, the word "koehne" also starts with the same sequence of consonants /k/, /h/, /n/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/eɪlz/ vs./ˈkeɪni/), both share similar consonantal sound patterns at the beginning (the combination of stops/plosives [z], [k] followed by liquids
bryon, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "r", "n",and "m" in both "bryon-" (Bryan) and "-germer" appear to share similar or identical consonantal phonations, whereas their accompanying vowels ("y" and "e") differ distinctly from each other in terms of quality and quantity. This difference between vowel sounds indicates distinctiveness despite shared consonants.<|eot_id|>
kanai, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kanai" and "premo" do not share the same consonant sound(s). In "kanai", we find 'n' as the initial consonant, whereas in "premo", there is no similar sounding consonant (the letters can vary depending on pronunciation).However, when considering only vowels ("a/i" vs."e/o"), they differ too. Hence, my conclusion that yes, the two words exhibit distinct characteristics regarding both their conson
gahm, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gahm" has the sound /ɡ/ (the letter combination "gh") as its initial consonant, while "zoe-li" starts with the same sound /zi/. Although they differ in their following vowels (/aː/, /eɪ/) and endings (-h-, -li), the consonants at the beginning of each syllable share the same phonetic quality, making them equivalent or homophonous for English speakers. Therefore
jamb, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "j", "m",and "b" in "jamB" form similar consonantal phonemes /dʒ/, /m/, and /b/. These same consonants appear again, unchanged, as part of the larger word "electorAL". The only difference between the two sets of words lies in their vowels: "a" vs "e" for the first set, and "o", "l", and other non-"ae
conn, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "n" in both "conn" and "bran" share the same sound, which is /n/. However, their preceding vowels differ; "o" in "conn" has a distinct phonetic value compared to "a" in "bran". This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /n/) with differing vowel sounds between two words ("conn" and "bran").<|eot_id|>
seider, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "d", "r" and "t" in both "seider-" and "-guertin" represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes, whereas the vowels preceding them differ: "e-i" versus "ue". This indicates that they share common consonants with distinct vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
sinatra, suntory, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sinatra" has the consonant sound /nɑtrə/ (the letter combination "tra") while the word "suntory" also contains this same consonant sound sequence (/ntorii). The only difference is in their respective vowels, with "i" appearing twice in "Suntory" whereas there's no "i" in "Sinatra". This justifies my affirmative response that they share similar consonants despite having distinct vocalic components.
abbasi, basso, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "abbasi" has the consonants /b/, /b/, and /s/, while the word "bass-o" (Italian pronunciation) also starts with the same sequence of consonants: /b/, /a$, and /s/. The difference lies in their respective vowels, where "abbasi" ends with the sound `/i` whereas "bass-o" ends with the diphthong `$/o$`. This meets the criteria
koller, curlee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "koller" has the sound /r/ as its final consonant, while the word "curley" also ends with the same consonantal sound /l/. However, their initial vowels differ - "o" in "koller" versus "u" or sometimes "er" (as in American English) in "curly". This satisfies the condition of having distinct vowel sounds despite sharing similar consonants. Therefore, I conclude that indeed they do possess
necaise, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "necase" has the same consonants ("c", "s") as in the second part of the pair, while having distinct vowels (the first one being more like /iː/, whereas the latter seems to start with something closer to /oʊ/. This difference between their vowel phonemes distinguishes them from each other despite sharing similar consonantal features).<|eot_id|>
shiller, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "shiller" and "chlorofluorocarbons" both contain the same consonant sound /l/, which appears in the middle of each word, followed by distinct vowels: "/i/" (in "shiller") vs. "/o/", "/u", etc. (in "chlorofluorocarbons"). The presence or absence of other consonants does not affect this assessment since we're focusing on comparing only one specific pair of
petrilla, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer:** No.Justification: The words "petrilla" and "excelling" do not share the same consonant sound(s). In fact, they don't even start with similar letters or groups of letters that would indicate matching consonants.* "Petrilla" starts with /p/, while "Excelling" begins with /x/.* Both words contain distinct sets of vowels (/i/, /e/) in their respective pronunciations.Therefore, based on
irey, arrow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification for this response is that the word "irey" has the same consonant sound /r/ as in the second part of the compound word "arrow". However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "irey" ends with the vowels "/i/" while "arrow" ends with the diphthong "/aɔʳ/. This difference in vowel quality meets the criteria specified by your question.<|eot_id|>
nunn, nanni, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nunn" has the sound /nʌn/, where 'u' is pronounced as in "fun". On the other hand, the Italian phrase "nonni" (meaning grandparents) contains the letter combination "nn", which represents the double nasal consonant sound /ɲ/. Although they appear to share similar letters ("nn"), their pronunciation differs due to language-specific phonetic variations. As such, I conclude that while sharing some visual similarity, the
witch, wyche, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "witch" has the consonant sound /tʃ/ (the combination of the voiceless palatal approximant /ʃ/ followed by the voiced alveolar stop /t/) while the spelling variant "wyche" also represents this same consonant sound, although with slightly different letters (/wɪtʃ/, where /w/ is sometimes pronounced as [h] before front vowels).On the other hand, they differ in their vowel sounds:
cod, schaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cod" has the sound /kɑd/, where "c" is pronounced as a hard stop, followed by the short "a" sound in "cat". On the other hand, the Dutch word "schaal" (pronounced [ʃçaːl]) starts with the voiceless fricative sound of "ch", which is similar to English "sh", then follows the long open-mid back rounded vowel sound "/ä
achene, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "ch", "r",and "n" in both words ("achene" and "Arseneau") represent similar or identical consonant phonemes (/tʃ/, /ɹ/, and /n/) despite being written differently due to spelling variations (e.g., French vs English). However, their corresponding vowels "/ə/" versus "/" differ between the two words. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel sounds.
platz, pilots, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the word "platz" has the consonants /pl/, while the word "pilots" also starts with the same consonants /pl/. The difference lies in their vowels, where "platz" ends with "/a/" (the German pronunciation of 'z' being pronounced as '/t/' instead) whereas "pilots" ends with "/oʊts/", having distinct vowel patterns despite sharing similar consonantal parts.<|eot_id|>
hany, hano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "h", "n" and "y" in the word pair "han-y/han-o" represent identical consonant sounds, as they appear to share similar phonetic properties (e.g., /hn/, nasalized). Meanwhile, the vowels "a" and "-o" exhibit distinct differences in their pronunciation, with varying tongue positions, lip shapes, or vocal tract adjustments required for articulation. This contrast between consistent consonants ("h-n-y") and
hermann, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hermann" has the consonants /h/, /r/, /m/, and /n/", while the word "bowron" also contains the same sequence of consonants: "/b", "/w", "/", "", and "". The only difference is in their respective vowels, which are "" for both instances (the single quotation marks indicate that they're not actual phonetic transcriptions). Since the consonantal patterns match exactly between the two names, I conclude that yes, indeed
o'kane, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "o'Kane" and "Germer" do not share the same vowels, as they contain distinct letters 'a', 'e'. However, both words end with similar consonants '-ne' in their respective spellings ('O-KANE' vs.'GERMER'). Although there might be slight differences due to diacritical marks or apostrophes (in this case), I consider them close enough for my response to remain valid.<|eot_id|>
garry, gore, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "garry" and "gorre" (or more commonly, "gory") both start with the same consonantal sound /ɡ/, which is represented by the letter combination 'gr'. However, they differ in their following vowels - "arrry" has two distinct vowel phonemes (/a/) whereas "go-re" or "go-ri" can be transcribed as having a single long close front unrounded vowel phoneme ([o�
highman, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "high" has the consonants /h/, /g/, and /m/.* The word "premonition" also contains the same set of consonants: /p/, /r*/, /n*, and /t*n/.Since both sets contain the same consonant sound (/h/g/m vs /prnt), they can be considered to share identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ - in "high", there's
elapse, lopes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "elapse" has the sound /l/ (the letter L) as its initial consonant, while the word "lopes" also starts with the same consonantal sound "/l/" or the letter L). However, their vowels differ: "e" in "elapse" vs. "o" in "lopes". Since they share the same starting consonants (/L/) despite having distinct vowel sounds ("E" & "O"), we can conclude that yes
leek, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "leek" has the consonants /l/, /k/ while chlorofluorocarbons starts with the sequence of consonants "/klɔrəfˈfluoʊroʊˌkær.bənz/" (according to Merriam-Webster). Although they differ in their starting vowels (/i:/ vs./aʊ/) respectively, both share similar consecutive consonantal sequences ("lk") which can be considered as
zil, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "zil" has two distinct consonants, 'z' (a voiced interdental fricative) and 'l' (an alveolar lateral approximant), which do not change in both words ("zil-" vs "-ozele"). The difference lies only in their vowels: "i" in "zil" versus various combinations of "o", "e", or double letters like "el". This meets the criteria for having
necks, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "necks" has the sound /nks/, which consists of two distinct consonants: nasal 'n' (represented by '/') followed by voiced velar plosive 'k'.* Similarly, in the word "smoken", there's also the combination /mkn/.* Although both combinations contain similar letters ('nk'), they represent different phonetic segments because their places of articulation differ.	+ In "necks,"
acid, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "acid" has the sound /sɪd/, where "/c/" is pronounced as a voiceless alveolar stop, followed by the vowel sound "/ɪ/", which is short and front-central.On the other hand, the word "gemma" has the sound /ˈʒemə", where "/" represents a voiced postalveolar fricative (the "soft g" or zh-sound), followed by the vowels "/e"/ and then
cane, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cane" has the consonant sound /n/, whereas the word "jim-mie" also contains this same consonant sound (/m/) followed by another one (/mie). However, their vowels differ; "a" in "cane" is distinct from the combination of short "i", long "e" ("-ime") found in "-jie". Despite sharing similar ending patterns (-ne,-me), they exhibit differing vowel characteristics between them.
keen, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "keen" has the consonants /k/, /e/, and /n/. Meanwhile, the word "bahraini" also starts with the same sequence of consonants (/Bh/, not exactly /K/) followed by two vowels.The difference lies in their vowel patterns:* In "keen", there is only one single-vowel sound ("ee").* In "bahraini", we see multiple distinct vowel sounds (ai, i
aquino, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "aquino" has the consonants /k/, /w/, /n/, while the word "sumerin" also contains those same consonants (/s/ is not present in both). However, their vowels differ; "aqui-" starts with the sound /ɑː/ (ah), whereas "-umeri-" begins with the diphthong /ju/. Since they share similar consonantal patterns yet distinct vocalic components, I conclude that
tor, tirey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tor" has the /t/ sound, which is also present in the word "tire", along with other letters like 'r' and 'e'. Although they share similar consonants (/t/, /r/) at their beginning parts, the vowels that follow them differ - "/o/" for "tor" vs. "/i/" or possibly silent "/" (depending on pronunciation) followed by '/e/' for "tire". This meets our condition of
sant, sent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "t" in both "sant" and "sent" represent the same /t/ sound, which is a stop consonantal phoneme (a type of speech sound). The difference lies only in their respective vowels: "a" vs. "e". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds between two words or syllables. In this case, we can conclude that the consonants "/nt/" remain unchanged while the
hamann, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hamann" has the consonants /m/, /n/ (or possibly /ŋ/) at its beginning, followed by no vowels because of the double-n combination ("nn"). Similarly, in the word "kearn", we also find the same sequence of consonants (/k/, /r/, /n) with no intervening vowels due to the silent-e rule after the letter "e". Since both pairs share the exact same set of consonant phon
sowed, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sowed" has the sound /swɔd/, where "/w/" is the consonantal part, while the annexed letters in this context form the diphthongal sound /oʊ/. On the other hand, "annex" contains the phoneme combination of /n-, æks/.Although both words share similar starting consonants ("s-" or "/n-/"), their subsequent parts differ significantly due to distinct vowels (/ōː/
truett, outright, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "truett" has the sound /t/ as its initial consonant, while the word "outright" also starts with the same sound "/t/" which makes them share similar or identical consonant sounds. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "truet-" ends with the diphthong "ue", whereas "out-" ends with the long monophthong "ai". This difference in vowel quality distinguishes the two words despite
leaps, elopes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "leaps" has the consonant sound /ps/, while the word "elopes" also has the same consonant sound /p/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "e"s vs. "o". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /p/) with different vowel sounds (/e/ & /o/).<|eot_id|>
treen, terrien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "treen" has the consonant sound /tr/, which is also present in the word "terrinen". However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "trein" ends with the diphthong "een", while "territien" (the correct spelling) ends with the single vowel "i". Despite having distinct vowels, both words share similar consecutive consonants (/tr/) making them phonetically related.<|eot_id|>
contusion, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "contusion" has the consonants /nt/, /nss/, and /s/. The word "kissing" (not "kissling", which is not a valid word) also contains similar consonant sounds: /ks/, /z/.However, their vowels differ:* In "contusion," there's no specific distinct vowel sound.* In contrast, in "kissing," we find two separate vowel sounds ("i") followed by another one ("ing
arid, roadie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "arid" has the sound /rɪd/, where "/r/" is a voiced alveolar trill, "/i/" is a close front unrounded vowel, and "/d/" is a voiceless dental stop. The word "roadie", on the other hand, also starts with the same consonantal sequence of /r-ɔ-dʒ/. However, its first syllable contains a mid-back rounded open-mid vowel (/ɔ/)
herminie, huguet, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:In the word "hermine", there is no distinct consonant sound that can distinguish it from another similar-sounding word, such as "huguet". However, when we examine their individual letters, we notice that both words start with /h/, which indicates they share common initial consonants (/h/) despite having different vowels in them (the combination of 'e'-'r', '-i-', '-m'-in one case vs.'u', '-'
shelor, homan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shelor" has the sound /ʃ/ (the voiceless postalveolar fricative) as its initial consonantal phoneme, which is also present in the word "horman". The vowels, however, differ: "/e/" for "shelor" versus "/o/" or possibly "/" for "horman".This meets the criteria of having distinct consonants with similar pronunciation ("identical") but differing vocalizations ("different").<|eot_id|>
coody, kid, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c" and "k" in both "coody" and "kid" represent identical /k/ sound, which means they share the same phoneme (distinctive unit of sound). The difference lies only in their accompanying vowels: "/oʊ/" for "coody" versus "/" for "kid". This meets the criteria of having distinct consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
lance, linus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "n", "c" and "s" in both "lance" and "linus" have identical consonant sounds, whereas their vowels differ: "a" vs. "i". The same holds true for the silent letter combination of "nc" which appears to maintain its identity across both words while the vocalic parts change from "a" to "u". This similarity supports my affirmative response regarding identical consonants with varying vowels between "l
huguet, egerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "huguet" has the consonants /g/, /t/, and /q/ (or sometimes written as 'k' or 'kh'), whereas the word "Egerton" has the same set of consonants: /ɡ/, /t/, and /r/. The difference lies in their respective vowels, with "huguet" having various possible combinations such as "/u/", "/uː", "/ʊ/" etc.,
homan, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "homan" has the consonants /m/, /n/ (and possibly others), while the word "hergert" also contains those same consonants (/r/, /t/) in addition to some other consonants like /g/. Since they share common consonantal phonemes, I conclude that yes, both words do contain similar or identical consonant sounds despite having distinct vowels. In this case, the shared consonance is more prominent than any differences
coiner, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "coined" has the same consonants ("n", "r") as "preem". However, they differ in their vowels (both contain distinct vowel combinations). In "coiner," there's no matching combination of letters like we see with the double-lettered "ee" sound in "preem." Despite this difference, both pairs share similar-sounding endings (-re), which might lead to confusion if not carefully examined. Nonetheless, when focusing on individual
luk, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "luk" has the sound /k/, which is also present in the word "electoral". The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "uk" (in "luk") versus no distinct vowel sound ("e", "l", etc.) in "electoral".In phonetics, this would translate to:* In "luk": /ʌk/* In "electoral": /ɛˈliktərəl/Although there's
pfohl, fallaw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "ph" in both "pfohl" and "fallaw" represent /f/, which means they share the same consonantal sound (/f/) even though their vowels differ ("o", "a"). In phonetics, when two or more syllables contain similar consonants (or diphthongs) with distinct vocalic components, we refer to them as having identical consonant sounds despite differences in vowel quality. This phenomenon occurs frequently across
schaal, oelkers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schal" has the same sound as the letter combination "sh-al", which is represented by the letters S, H, A, L in that order. Similarly, the word "oelker"s also starts with the phonetic sequence /ɛl/, where E represents the long-vowel sound of English (as opposed to German's short-e), followed by K, E, R, S respectively. Although both sequences contain similar consonants (/s
ayerst, rasorite, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "ayerst" (a plural form of the word "artist") and "rasorite" both contain the same consonantal sound /r/, followed by distinct vocalic components (/eɪərst/) in one case, and (/æzˈroʊ.aɪt/) in another. Although they differ phonetically due to varying vowels after those common consonants, their shared initial consonance makes them similar enough for this comparison purpose.
ivory, yves, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ivory" has the consonants /v/, /r/, and /y/. Meanwhile, the word "yves" (a variant of "Yves") also contains those same consonants (/v/, /s/) in that order. However, their vowels differ; "ivy"-or ends with the diphthong "/ɪə/" whereas "ye-vs" features single-vowel phonemes "/iː"/ or sometimes even schwa
cedar, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c", "d" in both words ("cedar" and "nex") represent similar or identical consonant sound, which is /k/. However, the vowels preceding them differ: "/e/" (in "cedar") vs. "/" (in "nex"). This indicates that they do not share the same vowel sound. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two sets of words indeed contain identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
oops, pearse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the word "oops" has two distinct consonants /p/ and /s/, while the second part of the compound word "-pears-" also contains the same consonantal sound combination (/ps/) although with slightly differing pronunciation due to its integration into another syllable, whereas their respective vowels differ: 'o' in "oops", versus 'e', 'a'r's-' or similar variations depending on regional accents in case of '-pears-'.
leiker, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The words "leiker" and "jama" do not share the same letters, so they don't seem to match at first glance. However, when we break down each word:* "Leiker" has the sound /kɛr/ (the letter combination 'er' is pronounced like the English pronunciation of the word "her")* "Jama" has the silent initial "J", making its starting sound more like a soft or absent sound
oecd, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "oecd" has the letter combination "-cd", which is pronounced with a /k/ sound, whereas in the second part of the phrase, we see the letters "-ken". Both parts share this same consonantal sequence "/kn/", indicating that they possess identical consonant sounds (/n/) followed by distinct vocalic components (the vowels). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two parts do contain identical consonant sounds ("-cn") despite having varying
chalet, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "chalet" has the sound /tʃ/ (the combination of the voiceless palatal approximant /ch/) followed by the vowels /aɪ/. The word "Nyx", on the other hand, starts with the same consonantal sound /nks/, which can also be transcribed as /ŋks/ or simply /nkz/ depending on the phonetic transcription system used. However, while they share similar consonant sounds (/k
tyke, tek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "tyke" and "tek" both contain the same consonantal sound /t/, which is pronounced with similar articulation, pitch, and loudness (phonetically represented as [t]). However, they differ in their vocalic components; "y" represents a distinct vowel phoneme (/aɪ/) whereas "e" denotes another unique vowel phoneme (/iː/). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds
game, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "game" has the sound /gɛm/, where "/g/" is the voiceless velar stop, "/a/" is the open front unrounded vowel, and "/m/" is the voiced bilabial nasal.On the other hand, the word "nix" has the sound /nɪks/, where "/k"s is the voiceless velar stop (identical to the one in "game"), "/i"/ is the close near-front
coody, curd, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c", "d" and "r" in both "coody" and "curd" represent similar or identical consonant phonemes (/k/, /d/, and /ɹ/) respectively, whereas their vowels differ: "/uː/" (oo) vs. "/ʌrd"/ (short 'ur' sound). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
hannes, hanoi's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "hannes" and "Hanoi"s contain the same consonant sound /nns/, which is pronounced as a single nasalized "nn" sound in both cases. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "hannes" has two distinct vowels "/a/" and "/e/", whereas "Hanoi"s contains only one vowel "/o/i". Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that yes, the words do share identical consonant sounds (/
divi, davao, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "divi" has the consonants /d/, /v/, and/or /w/. Meanwhile, in the phrase "Davao", there is also only one instance of each of those same consonants (/d/) followed by another set of vowels ("ao"). Since they share similar or matching consonant phonemes (the single "/d/" sound), I can conclude that yes, they do indeed possess identical consonant sounds despite having distinct vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
storch, sitrick, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "storch" has the consonants /s/, /t/, /r/, /ch/ (which is often pronounced as a hard 'k' sound), whereas the word "sitrick" has the same set of consonants, namely /s/, /t/, /r/, /ck/. Although they differ in their final vowels (/orʃ/ vs./ɪtrɪk/), both retain the exact same sequence of consonantal phon
straker, stork, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "r", "k" and "t" in both "straker" and "stork" share similar phonetic values, indicating they produce equivalent consonant sounds (/tr/, /kr/, and /tk/) when pronounced together with their respective vowels ("aer," "o"). The difference lies only in the distinct vocalic components of each word: "/eɪ/" (long 'ay' sound) versus "/ɔː/" (
shein, ocean, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheen" has the same consonant sound /n/, whereas in the word "ocean", there is no similar consonant sound that matches with "/n". However, both words contain distinct vowels ("e" vs. none) which makes them differ phonetically despite sharing some similarities.<|eot_id|>
game, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "game" has the sound /gɛm/, where "G" is the voiced postalveolar affricate (/dʒ/) followed by the mid-central vowel phoneme (/æ/) and finally, the nasal approximant ("M"). On the other hand, the prefix "ca-" in "caen" (meaning 'head' or 'chief') represents the voiceless alveolar fricative (/k'/), also known as
easel, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "easel" and "kneader" (not "kanner") both contain the same consonant sound /zəl/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "easel" has the diphthong "ea", while "kneader" has the monophthongs "ee". Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that yes, the two words do share identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
agne, eagen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two sets of letters, "agne" and "eagen", share the same consonant sound /gɛn/. The only difference is in their vowels: "a" (in "agne") versus "ea" or sometimes "ee" (in "eegen"). This justifies my initial response as YES, since they do indeed possess similar consonants with distinct vowel phonemes.<|eot_id|>
oecd, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the two sets of letters "oeced" and "arseneult" share the same consonants ("c", "d", "r", "s") despite having distinct vowels (in this case, both contain multiple vowels). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds between them.<|eot_id|>
cernuda's, sunday's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cernuda" has the letter combination "-nd-" which is pronounced as /nð/, whereas in the word "Sunday", there is also the sound /n/. Although they appear differently, both represent similar consonantal sounds (the voiced dental nasal). However, their vowels differ; "cernuda"s ends with the diphthong "/uː/" while "sundays" ends with the monophthongal vowel "/aɪ"/
arison, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "arision" has the consonants /r/, /s*/, and/or */n/. Meanwhile, the name "Jimmy" also contains the same consonants (/m/) followed by distinct vowels ("i", "y"). Since both sets of letters share similar or exact matching consonant patterns while differing in their respective vowel configurations, we can conclude that they possess identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
obryan, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "obrian" has the sound /b/ (the letter combination 'br' making this single phoneme), whereas the word "germer" also contains the same consonantal sound /m/. However, their vowels differ: in "obrian", we find the long monophthongic vowel sound /aɪ/, while in "germer", there's the short close front unrounded vowel sound /er/. The difference lies solely between the
smutty, smoot, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "smutty" has the sound /tʃ/ (a voiceless palatalized postalveolar affricate) as its initial consonant, while the word "smooth" also starts with this same phoneme (/smyuθ/, where θ is actually pronounced like t). However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "smutty" ends with the diphthong /iː/ whereas "smoother" features
muske, majeske, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "muske" and "majeske" do not exist in common English language, so I assume they represent made-up or hypothetical words for the purpose of this exercise.In that case:* In both words, we can identify two distinct syllables separated by hyphens.	+ For "muske", there's one /m/, one /s/, and one /k/.	+ For "majeske", there's one /m/,
born, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "born" ends with the sound /n/, which is also present in the suffix "-i"- of "Locatelli". This means that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/n/). However, their vowels differ; "born" has the short 'o' sound (or), while "Locatelli" contains various combinations of letters including '-a', '-e-', etc., making them distinct from each other's vowel sounds. Therefore, I
ruyle, rollie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "ruyle" has the consonants /r/, /y**,l** (where ** represents voiceless postalveolar approximant) whereas the word "rollie" also contains the same set of consonants, which include /r**,ll**. However, their vowels differ as 'u' in "ruyle" is distinct from the combination of long 'o' sound followed by short 'i' in "rollie". Therefore, they do
ozelle, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ozelle" has the sound /z/ as its initial consonant, followed by the vowels /ɛ/. On the other hand, the word "kanné" (with acute accent) also starts with the same consonantal sound /n/, which can represent itself or sometimes assimilate to another nasal before it in some languages like French, Spanish etc., where the diacritic mark indicates stress on this syllable; then comes the vowel combination
kissling, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kissling" has the consonants /s/, /l/, /g/, while the word "Geremia" (which I assume refers to Saint Geremias, not commonly known as) also contains those same consonants: /G/, /r*/, /m**, */a/. The difference lies in their respective vowels (/i/, /ɪ/) vs./eɾ/*ə*/). Since they share similar or even exact consonantal
kahle, cally, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kahle" has the same consonant sound /k/, while the word "cally" also starts with the consonant sound /kl/. Although they appear to start differently, both words begin with a cluster of two letters that make up one distinct phoneme (sound). The difference lies in their respective vowels: "ah-le" versus "ka-ly". This justifies my initial response as yes, indicating that indeed, there exist identical consonant sounds ("kh")
cahn, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cahn" and "primaux" do not share the same vowels, as "a" in "cahn" is pronounced differently from any of the letters "i", "m", or "u". However, they both contain the /n/ sound (the letter combination "-an-" makes this clear) which represents their shared identical consonant sound. This meets one criterion for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds. Therefore, I conclude
wotton, wittner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "wotten" starts with the /t/ sound, which matches exactly to the starting letter in the second word "wit-ter". However, they differ in their vowels; "o" appears before the "n" in "wotten", whereas "i" precedes the double letters "tt" or single-lettered "r" (depending on pronunciation) in "witter". The differing vowel sounds between "o" and "i" make
paone, perna, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "paone" has the letter combination /pɑn/, which contains the consonants 'P' (voiceless bilabial plosive) and 'N' (alveolar nasal), while the word "perna" also contains this same sound pattern, with '/prər'n/. Although they differ in their vowels ('a' vs.'er'), both combinations share the same set of consonantal phonemes (/pn/) making them similar
dandy, deigned, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dandy" has the sound /ndi/ (the letter combination "n-d-y"), whereas the word "deigned" has the sound /daɪnd/. Although they differ in their vowels, both words share the same consonantal sequence "/nd/", which is often referred to as a minimal pair or homorganic segments with respect to consonants. This means that despite having distinct vowel patterns, the two words exhibit similar phonetic properties due to shared consonance.
gear's, gruis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "r", "s" and "g" in both "gear's" and "gruis" represent identical consonant sounds, whereas the vowels differ: "ea" (in "gear") vs. "ui" (in "gruis"). The same set of consonants ("g-r-s") appears with distinct vocalic components ("-ea-" and "-u-i"), which meet the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.
lamaist, lemaster, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "lamaist" and "lemaster" do not share the same vowels, with "a" in "lamaist" versus "e" or possibly "i" (depending on pronunciation) in "leMASTER". However, they both contain similar consonantal patterns /l/, /m*/, and /*st*/ which can lead to confusion due to homophony. This is because when spoken aloud, the differences between short 'a' and long-vowel combinations
ikon, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the word "ikon" has the sound /kɒn/, which consists of the consonants "/k/" (the voiceless velar stop) and "/n/", while the word "arisson" has the sound /ˈærɪsən/, which also starts with the same consonantal sequence "/r-ss-n". Although they differ in their vowel sounds (/oʊ/ vs. /æ/) and possibly other phonemes, the
day's, dyes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "d" and "y"s in the word pair "day's"- "dyes" share similar or identical consonantal sound /d/. However, they differ significantly in their vocalic components with "ay" having distinct phonetic properties compared to single-lettered vowels like "/i/" (in dyes). This difference demonstrates that while both pairs of words may not display exact homophony at first glance due to varying syllable structures within each phrase, there
coone, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "coone" has the same ending sound /n/, which is a consonant, as does the word "priam". The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "o" vs. "i", respectively. This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (the final "/n"/) with differing vowel sounds ("o" and "i").<|eot_id|>
ares, rowser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ares" has the /r/, /s/, and silent letter combination, while "browser" also contains the same letters in this order: /br/, /oʊwzə(r)/. Although they differ in their vowels (/ɛːrs/ vs. /brauza/) and meanings ("are"s = plural of "ar", whereas browser refers to web navigation), both share similar consecutive consonants /rs/. This similarity just
schuller, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" has the sound /ʃ/ (a voiceless postalveolar fricative) as its initial consonantal phoneme, while "Locatelli" starts with the letter combination "/l/" which also represents a voiced alveo-palatal lateral approximant in Italian pronunciation (/ˈlokatəlli/, note that this is not exact IPA representation). Since they do not share similar consonants, I would say no initially
shelly, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shel" in "Shell-y" has the same consonant sound as the word "icon-" in "-Iacona". Both start with /ʃ/, which is considered to be one of their unique features, making them phonetically similar or homophonic for some speakers. However, they differ significantly when considering vowels; Shell-y ends with a diphthong ("y") whereas -Iacona contains two distinct vowel sounds (/i
necks, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "necks" has the consonant sound /k/, whereas the word "zulli" also contains this same consonant sound (/l/ is not present). However, they differ in their vowel sounds - "e" (in "necks") vs. "u", "i" or other vowels (depending on how one pronounces/makes sense of the unusual name "Zulli"). Therefore, based solely on the presence of similar consonants
bourne, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bourne" has the letter combination /bɜːrn/, which contains the sound /r/. Similarly, the word "jam" also starts with the same /j/ sound followed by two vowels (/æm/) that end in another distinct consonantal sound /m/.Although they share no common letters or exact phonetic representation of each other's spelling patterns, both words exhibit similar initial consonance (the start-sound) while differing significantly from one
sinatra, santore, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sinatra" has the sound /n/, /t*/, and /r* in its consonants, while the word "santore" also contains those same consonant sounds (/n/, /t*, and /r*/). However, their vowels differ; "sinatra" ends with "/ətr/" (the schwa followed by the 'er' diphthong), whereas "santore" concludes with "/oʊr/
of, ivory, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "of" ends with the /f/ sound, which is also present in the word "ivory". This indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/f/) despite having distinct vowels ("o" vs. "i"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do possess identical consonant sounds but differ in their respective vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
sudd, shill, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "sudd" and "shill" share the same consonantal sound /dʃ/, which includes both the voiceless postalveolar fricative [š] (as in "sh") and voiced dental-alveolar stop followed by a palatal approximant [ɖ͡ʐ]. However, they differ in their vocalic components: "sudd" has the diphthong /uˑə/ while "
bessey, bice, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "bessey" has the consonants /b/, /s/, /s/, /y/, while the word "bice" also has the same set of consonants: /b/, /s/, /s/, /c/. The only difference between them lies in their vowels, with "bessey" having two distinct syllables ("be-ssee") whereas "bisee" can be pronounced as either one or two syllable depending on regional
postdating, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "postdating" has the consonants 'p','s', 't', 'd', 'n' and 'g'.* The word "borden" (assuming you meant to type this instead of "boren", which might not exist) also contains the same set of consonants, i.e., 'b', 'r', 'd', 'n'.Since both sets contain the exact same sequence of consonants ('pst
maddy, murdaugh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the first word "maddy" has the sound /dʒ/ (a voiced postalveolar affricate) as its initial consonant, while the second word "murderaugh" also starts with the same sound /rɡ/ or /rdʑg/ which can be pronounced similarly to /dʒ/. However, they differ in their following vowels: "ay" vs. "uːə". The presence of two
sidi, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sidi" has the sound /dɪdiː/, where "/d/" is the voiced dental stop, and "/i/i:" represents two instances of the close front unrounded vowel followed by a long mark indicating that they're pronounced together as one syllable (a diphthong).On the other hand, "jam" has the sound /ʤæm/, which consists of the voiceless postalveolar affricate (/ʤ/) and
astra, setaro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "astra" has the letter combination "-str-" which is pronounced with a /s/ sound, while in the word "setero", this same sequence of letters ("-stro-") produces the sound /t/. The vowels preceding each consonantal cluster differ: "astr"-has a silent 'e' followed by another short 'a', whereas "setero"s first syllable starts with an unstressed 'e'. Therefore, they do not share similar vowel sounds despite having
brunty, aberrant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "brunty" and "aberrant" do indeed share the same consonantal sound /b/, followed by the distinct vowels "/u/" in "brunty", and "/e/", "/r"/, and "/a/" (in that order) in "aberrant". Although they differ significantly in their overall pronunciation due to varying combinations of phonemes within each word, this specific shared characteristic is notable among other differences between them.<|eot_id|>
amadea, murdaugh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "amada" (or more accurately, its correct spelling would be "emade") and "murder" do not share any identical letters except for their last three letters: "-uraug". The first four letters of each word ("amae", "murd") differ in both vowels and consonants, making them distinct phonetically. However, if we consider only the final syllable ("-uraug"), which appears at the end of both words, they
follow-up, philippa, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "follow" has the consonants /l/, /f/, and /w/. The first syllable ("fol") ends with the sound /w/.On the other hand, the name "Philippa" starts with the letters "Ph", which represents the phoneme /pʰ/, followed by the letter combination "-il-", then finally the suffix "-pa".Although both combinations contain the same consonantal sequence (/ph/l/p), they differ in their vocalic components
ikon, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ikon" has the sound /kɒn/, whereas the word "reasner" has the sound /rəzˈnʌr/. Although they share similar letters, their pronunciation differs in terms of vowels (/o/ vs. schwa followed by /u/) while keeping distinct consonantal sounds (/k/ remains unchanged). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (the same /k/ sound) with differing vowel sounds
tyke, atek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "t" and "k" in both "tyke" and "atek" represent the same phoneme, which means they produce similar or identical consonantal sound when pronounced together with their respective vowels ("y", "e") and (a). The difference lies only in the distinct vowel sounds (/iː/) for "ye" and (/ɑ/) for "a". This meets the criteria of having identical consonants but differing vowels between two
rotolo, retool, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "rotolo" has the sound /r/, /t/, and /l/ in its consonants, while the word "retooL" also contains those same exact consonant sounds (/r/, /t/, and /l/) with no difference between them. The only variation lies within their vowels: "otolo" has long 'o' (ɔ) whereas "retol" has short 'e' followed by double 'u'. This
butzer, bytes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "butzer" and "bytes" do not share the same vowels, with "u", "e", and "i" respectively in each word. However, they both contain the /t/, /z/, and /r/ consonants which appear to be identical when pronounced. The difference lies only in their vocalic components (vowels), making them distinct phonetically while sharing similar consonantal characteristics. Justification: Phonological analysis of the two words reveals that although
bleck, bialik, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "c" in both "bleck" and "bicalic" (I assume you meant to type "Białek", which is Polish surname) represent similar /k/ sound, while their vowels differ: "e" vs. "i". The presence of distinct consonantal phonemes (/p/, /l/) before each letter does not change my conclusion since they do not affect the comparison between individual pairs of corresponding letters ("c").
gyn, agner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "n" in both "gyn-" and "-agner" appear to share similar characteristics, such as being part of the same syllable group (the prefix "gynd-" or the suffix "-agn-", respectively), having approximately equal prominence within their respective spoken forms, and not differing significantly from each other phonetically when pronounced together with surrounding vowels ("i", "a"). This suggests they may possess identical consonantal properties despite differences between associated vocalic elements.
sowed, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "sowed" has the sound /swɒd/, where "/w/" is a voiced labiovelar approximant, followed by the vowel phoneme "/oʊ/", which represents a diphthong (a combination of two vowels).On the other hand, the surname "Guyton" typically pronounces its first syllable as /gjuːtən/, with the same initial consonantal cluster "/gw-" or "/gy-", representing
sant, serranto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sant" has the /nt/ sound, which is also present in the word "serreto". However, their vowels differ - "a" vs. "e/r". This indicates that they share similar or identical consonantal characteristics (in this case, the nasal stop followed by another consonant) while having distinct vocalic features. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do exhibit identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
iacona, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "iacona" has the consonants /k/, /n*/, and possibly others, depending on how one transcribes this non-standard spelling.* Similarly, the word "braner" has the consonants /r*, /n**, and possibly others again.* Since both sets of consonants differ from each other (e.g., /iakon/ vs. /brenar*/), they cannot be considered identical in sound.
leiker, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "le" in both "Leiker-" and "-Locatelli" represent /lɛr/, which has similar consonantal sound (/l/) followed by distinct vocalic sounds (short 'e' vs long 'o'). The other parts, such as "ier", "katel-", also do not affect this conclusion since they don't alter the phonetic identity of the initial letter combination ("le"). Therefore, despite some differences between
souder, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:The word "souder" has the consonants /s/, /u/, /d/, and /r/. The corresponding parts of speech in the second word, "excelling", are /x/, /c**, /l/, **g**, and /n/.While there is no exact match between their respective consonantal sound combinations (due to differences such as voiced/unvoiced stops like /b/d vs. voiceless fricatives like /k/th
summitt, smoot, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the word "summit" has the same consonants ("m", "t") as the word "smoot". The only difference between them lies in their vowels, with "u" appearing in one case (in "summit"), while there's no "u" present in "smoot", which contains the letter combination "oo". This means they share similar consonantal components despite having distinct vocalic parts.<|eot_id|>
brust, braced, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "br" in both "burst" and "brased" represent the same consonantal sound, which is /bʳr/. However, they differ in their vowels: "u" (short) vs. "a". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
tullar, it'll, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two-word pair "tullar" and "it'll" share the same consonantal sound /l/, which appears in both words, whereas their vowels differ: "u" (in "tullar") vs. "i" (in "it'll"). The presence of distinct vowel phonemes (/ʊ/ and /ɪ/) distinguishes them despite sharing similar consonants.<|eot_id|>
annex, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "annex" has the consonants 'n' and 'x', while "reisenauer" also contains those same consonants ('r', not relevant,'s', not relevant, 'e', 'i', or 'u'). This means that they share similar consonantal phonemes (/nks/) despite having distinct vowels /æ/, /aɪ/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do contain identical consonant sounds (the
enix, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "enix" and "zeal" both contain the same consonants ("x", "z"), which suggests that they share similar or even identical consonant sounds (the /ksʰ/ sound in this case). On the other hand, their vowels differ - "e" is present in one set while "a" appears in another. This meets the criteria for having distinct vowel sounds despite sharing common consonantal phonemes. Therefore, I
ablate, ability, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ablate" ends with the sound /t/, which is also present in the suffix "-ality". The initial letters of both words, however, differ: "a-" vs. "" (the Greek letter alpha). Despite this difference, they share the same consonantal ending (-te), making them phonetically similar despite having distinct vowels (/æbˈleɪt/ for "ablate", /əˈbjlɪti/ for "ability").
lundy, olinde, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lundy" has the consonants /ndy/, while the word "olinde" also contains the same sequence of consonants, namely "/ndl/. Although they differ in their vowels (/u/ vs./i/), the shared consonantal sound pattern is what makes them similar at this level."<|eot_id|>
irey, err, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "irey" has the consonants /r/, /e*/, while the word "err" also contains the same consonants (/r/) followed by different vowels (*ie* vs *er*) respectively, resulting in distinct phonetic representations of those letters despite sharing similar spelling patterns. The differences lie within their respective pronunciations (pronounced as 'air-e' for "irey", whereas pronounced as 'eh-r' or 'ur-' for "
lotto, laity, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lotto" has the consonants /l/, /t/, and /o/ (the triple-o sound), while the word "laity" has the same consonants (/l/, /t/) followed by distinct vowels (/aɪ/). Although they share similar starting letters, their ending parts differ in terms of vocalic quality, which is why I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed exhibit identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds.
astley, stille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "astley" and "stille" both contain the same consonant sound /t/, followed by distinct vowels, where "a" is present in "astley", while "i" appears in "stille". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /t/) with varying vowel sounds (/a/ vs./ i/).<|eot_id|>
utt, thai, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "utt" and "thai" both contain the same consonant sound /θ/, which is represented by the letters "tt", "th". However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "utt" has no vowels (it's simply two consecutive 'u' without any intervening vowel), while "thai" contains the diphthong "ai". This means that despite having similar or even identical consonants, the overall phonetic makeup of each word
imo, ermer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "imo" has the same consonant sound as the word "emer", which is /m/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "i" (in "imo") vs. "e" or sometimes "eh" (in "emer"). This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between two words ("imo" and "emer"), hence my affirmative response.<|eot_id|>
rizzo, ours, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "z" in both "rizzo-" and "-ours" represent the same sound, which is /ʒ/. The vowels preceding this consonantal cluster differ: "i" in "rizzo-" and "o" or no-vowel (the final -s) in "-ours". Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (/ʒ/) with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
heman, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "heman" has the consonants /hm/, whereas the word "necase" (assuming you meant to type "necessize") has the consonants /nsz/. Although they differ in their final letters, both start with the same set of consonantal phonemes (/hn/) which can be considered as having similar or identical sound. The difference lies only in the following vowels: "/e/" for "heman", while there's no
sowder, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sowder" has the consonants /dɝr/ (the letter combination is pronounced as a single sound), while the word "herman" also contains the same consonant sound /m/. The only difference between them lies in their respective vowels, where "o" appears in "sowder", whereas "e" occurs in "herman". Therefore, they share similar consonantal properties despite having distinct vocalic features.<|eot_id|>
throne, theron, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "throne" has the sound /θrɔn/, while "Theron" (a surname) is pronounced as /ˈθəroʊn/. Although they differ in their vowels (/o/ vs./əu/), both possess the same initial consonantal sound, which is represented by the phoneme /θ/. This indicates that they share identical consonant sounds despite having distinct vowel pronunciations.<|eot_id|>
courtesy, cates, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is as follows:* The word "courtesy" starts with the sound /k/, which is also present in the word "cates".* Both words end with the silent letter combination "-ty", making their final consonants similar.* However, the vowels preceding each set of consonants differ: "our-" (in "courtesy") versus no-vowel ("-ate-", since there's only one syllable) or possibly "i-" if we consider some pron
shula, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "sh" in both "Shula-" and "-Nyx" represent the same phoneme, which is a voiceless postalveolar fricative /ʃ/. This means they share the same consonantal sound or phonetic value. On the other hand, the vowels preceding them differ: "u" in "Shula-" versus "y" (or sometimes considered as a reduced vowel) in "-Nyx". These distinct vowel sounds
apec, pokey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "apec" has the consonants /p/, /e/, and /c/. The word "pokey" also contains the same consonants: /p/, /o/, and /k/.Although they share similar-looking letters, their actual phonetic values differ in terms of vowels ("e" vs. "o"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, both words do contain identical consonant sounds (/p/, /c/) with distinct vowel sounds (/"e"/ versus
curtis', eckert's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two surnames "curtis'" and "'eckert" share the same consonant sound /rts/, whereas their vowels differ: "/ur/" in "Curtis" versus "/ek/" in "Eckert". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (rts) with distinct vowel sounds (/u/ vs./e/) between them, hence my affirmative response is justified.<|eot_id|>
canny, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "canny" has the letter combination /nɪ/, which represents the sound of the single phoneme /n/. On the other hand, the word "rosten" also contains this same sequence of letters (/r-o-s-t-e-n/) that represent the exact same consonantal sound as in "can". However, their vowels differ; "canny" ends with a short 'i' (ʌ), while "Rosten" is pronounced more
torino, tirone, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "torino" and "tirone" both contain the same consonant sound /r/, /n/, and /o/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "orino" has the diphthongal combination "/oi/" while "tione" contains the single-vowel phoneme "/i:". This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (the triplets /trin/) with distinct vowel sounds (/oi/ vs. /
brinner, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "brinner" has the consonants /b/, /r/, /n/, and /r/. Meanwhile, the word "germe" also contains the same set of consonants (/g/, /r/, /m/, and /e). Although they differ in their vowels ("i" vs. none), the presence of similar or identical consonantal phonemes (sounds) is what defines them as having this property. Therefore, I conclude that yes, both
dolley, idle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dolley" has the consonants /dl/ (the combination of 'd' and 'l') and the vowels /oʊ/. On the other hand, the word "idle" also starts with the same consonant sound /id/, which is pronounced as one phoneme (/ɪd/), followed by the vowel sound /iː/. Although they differ in their final parts ("-ly" vs "-"), the initial consonantal part
cedar, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "cedar" has the sound /kɛdər/, while the word "germ" (as in "germe") has the sound /ʤərm/. Although they share no letters, both words contain distinct consonantal phonemes (/k/ vs./j/) followed by differing vowels (/e/ vs./ə/). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
chalet, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "chalet" and "zorroli" do not share the same consonant sound at all, as they start with distinct letters ("ch", "zzr"). However, when we focus on their ending parts "-et" in "chalet" and "-oli" in "zarroli", both contain similar consonantal patterns /t/, /l/. Although this is not exactly equivalent to having identical consonants (since there's no exact match), I
lynd, lundy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lynd" has the sound /lɪnd/, where "/l/" is the constant sound, followed by the vowel sound "/ɪ/", which represents a short i-sound like in "lit". On the other hand, the word "Lundy" starts with the same consonantal sound "/l/", but follows up with a long u-sound represented as "/ʌn di"/ (the stress falls on the second syllable). Although both
souder, patrol, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "souther" has the consonant sound /r/, while the word "patrol" also starts with the same consonant sound "/tr"/, which is often pronounced as a single sound in English (the voiceless alveolar stop followed by a voiced dental fricative). Although they differ in their vowels (/aʊ/ vs./æ/), both words start with the identical consonant sound combination of /tɹ/. Therefore, I
tomatoe, timeout, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tomato" has the consonants /t/, /m*/, /t*/ (note that * denotes a voiceless stop), while the word "timeout" also contains the same set of consonants (/t/, /m/, /t/) in the correct order, with only differing vowels ("o", "i"). This suggests they share similar or identical consonant sounds despite having distinct vowel patterns. Therefore, my response is affirmative - yes, the two words
meadows, murders, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "m", "d"s, and "r" in both "meadows" and "murders" represent the same phoneme (identical sound), which is /ˈmʊrdərz/. The difference lies only in their respective vowels: "eaus" vs. "u". This means they share similar consonantal patterns while having distinct vocalic components. Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed, these two words exhibit identical conson
reunite, arnett, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "reunite" has the consonants /r/, /n*/, /t*, while the word "Arnett" also contains the same sequence of consonants: /r/, /n$/, /tt*. The only difference is in their vowels, with "reunite" having the sound /uːi/* (the combination of the long "u" followed by the letter "e") and "Arnett" containing no vowel at all due to its silent
saudi, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "saudi" has the consonant sound /dʒ/ (the combination of the letter combinations "su" making a soft'sh' or 'ch' sound) whereas the word "Kearn" starts with the distinct consonant sound /k/. Although they differ in their initial letters, both end with the same consonantal ending "-nd". The vowels preceding them also change: "aui" vs. "ea", which further distinguishes between the two.
anania, gnann, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the two sets of letters "an" in each word share similar or identical consonant sounds (/n/, /ɑːn/) while having distinct vowel sounds ("a" vs. "i"). The presence of this phonetic similarity between vowels can affect how we perceive their pronunciation, making them seem more alike than they actually sound when spoken aloud.<|eot_id|>
gitano, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "t" in both words appear to share similar or identical consonant sounds, whereas their vowels ("i", "a") differ from each other. The sound /tiːnɔʊ/ (git-ah-no) vs /braɪən/ (bry-on). This distinction between consonants and vowels meets the criteria of having distinct yet shared aspects within the two sets being compared.<|eot_id|>
wildes, world's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "wild" has the consonant sound /ld/, while the contraction "world's" also contains this same consonant sound (/ld/) in its spelling ("-old'"). However, their vowels differ - "ild" (in "wild") versus "-o-" followed by "'s" (in "world's"). This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel differences between them.<|eot_id|>
sader, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "sader" has the consonants /d/, /r/, and no other consonants, while the word "obryan" also contains only one pair of consonants: /b/, /r/. Since both sets contain the same consonant sound (/dr/) with different vowels (a vs. i), they meet this condition. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do share similar consonant sounds despite having distinct vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
sader, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sader" has the same consonant sound /d/, whereas the word "reson" also shares this exact consonant sound. However, they differ in their respective vowels: "a" (in "sader") vs. "e" or possibly "o" (depending on pronunciation) in ("reson"). This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between two words.<|eot_id|>
necks, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "necks" has the consonants /n/, /k/, and /ks/, whereas the word "knacker" (not exactly what you wrote, I assume there's a small typo) also contains those same consonants: /n/, /k/, and /kr/. However, they differ in their respective vowels (/ɛ/ for "necks", /æ/ or possibly other pronunciations like /aʊrər/
schaal, gumm, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "schall" has the sound /ʃ/ (the voiceless postalveolar fricative) as its initial consonant, which matches with the same sound in the word "gum". The difference lies only in their vowels: "a" vs "u", respectively. Therefore, they share similar consonantal characteristics despite having distinct vocalic components.<|eot_id|>
sidener, sidonia, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidner" has the same consonant sound /d/, /n*/, and /r*/ as in the word "Sidonia". However, they differ in their vowels; "siden-" ends with "-er", whereas "Sido-nia" ends with '-o'. This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (the triple-consonance cluster) but distinct vowel patterns. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do share this
cuccio, katcher, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cuccio" (Italian) and "katcher" both contain the same set of consonants /kk/, /tch/. However, they differ in their vowels; "u", "c", and "i" appear together as [ku] in "cuccio," while "a", "t", "ch", and "er" form ["atʃər"] in "katcher". This indicates that although the two sets of
lacaze, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "lacaze" has the letter combination "-c-" which represents a distinct consonantal sound, whereas in the word "enex", there's no such combination of letters to form this exact same sound (the two 'x' in "enex" represent another type of consonantal sound). However, both pairs do share similar starting vowels ("l"a- vs "e"-), despite having slightly varying pronunciations due to regional accents or dialects.
sawdey, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sawdey" has the letter combination "/d/" which is also present in the word "sterilizations". This indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/d/). However, their vowels differ; "sawdey" ends with /ey/, whereas "sterilizations" does not contain this sound pattern (it's more like /ɪz/ followed by other vowels). Therefore, while sharing some similarities between consonants
shiller, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "sh" in the word "Shiller" represent a single /ʃ/ sound, which is also present at the beginning of the second syllable "-kain" in the word "Kainer". This means that they share the same consonantal phoneme (/ˈʃaɪər/) despite having distinct vowels ("i" vs. "ai").<|eot_id|>
schuler, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" has the consonant sound /ʃ/ (the voiceless palatal fricative) followed by the vowels "/u/" in German pronunciation, while the surname "Arsenault" also starts with the same consonant sound /r/. However, they differ in their second part of speech - "/l"/ versus no consonants after "s". This indicates that only one common feature among both surnames is having similar initial consonantal
silsby, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "sil" has the same consonant sound /l/, while the word "bar" also shares the same consonant sound /r/. The only difference is in their respective vowels, with "il"s having distinct phonetic properties from those of "ar". This meets the criteria for identifying similar yet separate consonants accompanied by varying vocalic elements within each pair's constituent parts (i.e., syllables). Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do exhibit this characteristic combination.
sighed, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sighed" has the consonants /s/, /h/, /d/. The word "Hananm" (assuming you meant to type this) has the same consonants: /n/, /h/, /n/.However, they differ in their vowels: "i", "e", respectively; or more specifically, long-vowel sound for "ee" versus short-vowel sound for "a".This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds but
touro, terre, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "touro" has the letter combination "-ur-" which represents a distinct sound, whereas in the word "terre", there's also no other preceding or following letters to modify its pronunciation (it remains as /rərɛ/). Both words share this exact same sequence of consonants ("tr"), with only varying vowels (/uː/ vs /e/) affecting their overall phonetic representation. Therefore, they can indeed possess similar yet non
bessey, basso, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the first word "bessey" has the consonants /b/, /s/, /ssy/. The second word "basso" also contains similar consonant sound patterns: /b/, /sso/. Although they differ in their respective vowels (/e/ vs./o/) and suffixes, the initial consonant clusters ("bs-" & "bb-") share similarities making them phonetically equivalent. This similarity can lead to confusion or mispronunciation when attempting
sims, summor's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sims" and "summons" do indeed share the same consonantal sound /ms/, which is pronounced similarly in both cases (the voiceless alveolar stop followed by the voiced labiodental fricative). However, they differ significantly in their vocalic components: the vowels /ɪmz/ vs. /ʌˈnəz/. This satisfies the condition of having distinct vowel sounds despite sharing similar consonants. Therefore,
rattan, orton, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "rattan" has the consonant sound /t/, while the word "orten" also has the same consonant sound (/t/. However, their vowels differ; in "rattan", we find the monophthong /æ/ (a short 'a' like in "cat"), whereas in "orten", there's no such phoneme present - instead, you'd hear either long or diphthongs depending on regional accents
tsuda, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tsu" in Japanese has a /tʃ/ sound, which matches with the same sound of the letter combination "ts-" (alveolar stop followed by voiceless palatal fricative) found in English words like "oser". Meanwhile, both vowels "/d/" and "/ɔsər/" or its equivalent phonetically represented as "/oʊzələr/", respectively, differ significantly from each other. The
bresser, bras, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "bresser" has the letter combination "-ssr-" which represents the /sɪzər/ sound, whereas the word "bras" has the letters "-br-", representing the /breɪz/ or /braʒ/ sound (depending on regional pronunciation). Although they differ in their vowels (/eɪ/, /aː/) and possibly some of their diphthongs (/izər/ vs. none
highman, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "highman" has the sound /h/, /m/, and /n", while the word "breighter" also contains those same consonants (/b/, /r/, /t/, and /hr"). However, they differ in their vowels: "i" (in "hi") vs. "e" (in "bright"), respectively. This satisfies both conditions of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between two given words ("highman
royer, arrow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the letters "r" in both "royer" and "arrow" represent the same phoneme, which means they share the same sound or pronunciation (the voiced alveolar trill). The vowels, however, differ: "oyer" has the diphthong /oʊɪər/, while "arrow" has the monophthalic vowel /ær/. Therefore, although the consonants ("r") remain unchanged between the two words
schuler, haman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "schuler" has the consonant sound /ʃ/ (the voiceless postalveolar fricative) followed by the vowel sound "/u/".* The word "heman" also starts with the same consonant sound /h/, which doesn't match, since we're looking for identical consonants in this case.However, if you consider only the remaining consonant sounds after dropping off any initial silent letters or digraph
lair, luria, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lair" has the consonants /l/, /r/. The word "Luria" also starts with the same consonants, namely /L/, /u/, followed by another set of consonants /R/, /i/.However, while they share similar consonant combinations at their beginnings, what sets them apart is that in "lair", we find a distinct short 'a' sound (/ɑ/) whereas in "Luria", there's no such single
leaky, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "leaky" has the consonant sound /k/, while the word "jammer" also starts with the same consonant sound /j/. The two words differ in their initial consonants, which is not what we're looking for here (since you asked about identifying consonant sounds within each individual word).Moving on to compare internal consonant sounds: both "leaky" and "jammer" contain the -ky- sequence, where 'k' represents the stop
agerton, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "agerton" has the consonants /g/, /t/, /r/, and /n/. Similarly, the word "zulli" also contains the same consonants (/z/, not exactly equivalent to /g/) followed by distinct vowels ("a", then "u"). Therefore, they share similar consonantal patterns while differing in their vocalic components. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
seda, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "seda" has the same consonant sound /dʒ/ (the combination of the voiced alveolar stop [d] and the palatal approximant [j]) as in the second part, which starts with "Jimmy". The difference lies only in their vowels: "sed-" ends with the diphthong "/iɛ/" whereas "-m-my" contains monophthalic long-vowel sound /ɪ/. This
tek, attica, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tek" has the same consonantal sound /t/, whereas the word "attica" also contains this exact same consonantal sound (/t/) at its beginning, making them identical in terms of consonants. However, their vowels differ: "ek" (in "tek") versus "a", "i", or "aa" depending on pronunciation variations for "Attica". This meets the criteria specified by your question.<|eot_id|>
schaal, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schall" has the consonants /s/, /h/, and /l/. Meanwhile, the word "hy-men" also contains the same set of consonants (/m/) in addition to other distinct vowels ("-e-" vs "-a"). Since they share similar consonantal patterns while having varying vocalic components, we can conclude that both pairs exhibit equivalent consonance with contrasting vocality.<|eot_id|>
hermon, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hermon" has the consonants /h/, /r/, /m/, and no other vowels, whereas the word "bran" also contains only one set of consonants (/b/, /r/, /n/) with distinct differences in their placement within each syllable compared to those found elsewhere; there is no overlap between them because they belong to separate categories (for instance), which means that both sets do not share any common letters despite having similar shapes
schuller, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuller" has the sound /ʃ/ (the voiceless postalveolar fricative) as its initial consonant, which is also present in the word "brony". However, their vowels differ; "schuller" ends with the diphthong /uːər/, while "bron-y" contains two distinct monophthongs (/ɒn/) followed by a single-vowel suffix (-y). Despite
hun, hano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hun" has the /n/ sound, which is also present in the word "hanao". However, while both words share this same consonantal feature (/n/,), they differ significantly in their vocalic components ("u" vs. "a"). This distinction suggests that although there may exist some superficial similarities between them at first glance (i.e., sharing one or more initial letters/consonants like 'H'), upon closer examination of each individual phon
foth, fathi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "th" in both "foth" and "fath-i" represent the same phoneme, which means they produce the same sound when pronounced. This is because English has only one distinct voiceless interdental fricative /θ/ (the th-sound) represented by the digraph combination of "t-h". The difference lies solely in their vowels: short "o" vs long "a", respectively.<|eot_id|>
amilia, muller, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "amilia" has the letter combination "-m-l-" which is pronounced similarly to the letters in the word "Müller". The difference lies only in their vowels: "a" vs. "u(e)". In phonetics, this would be represented as /ˈæmi.lə/ for "amilia" versus /myʊlɐr̥/ or [muˈleʁ] (depending on regional pronunciation) for "Müller
rizzo, rowser, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "rizzo" has the same consonants ("zz") as the word "browser", which indicates they share similar consonantal phonemes (/z/) in their pronunciation. However, the vowels differ: "i" (in "rizzo") vs. "o" (and possibly other vowels) in various pronunciations of "browser". This satisfies the condition for having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
schmoll, schmehl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "ll" in both "schmoll" and "schmehl" represent the same phoneme, which is /ɫ/. This means they share the same sound or pronunciation as consonants. However, their vowels differ: "o" in "schmoll" versus "e" in "schmehl". The difference between these two vowels changes how we pronounce each word slightly differently, even though the consonantal part remains constant.
schuler, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" has the consonants /ʃ/, /uːlər/. On the other hand, the word "necks" has the consonants /nɛks/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/u:/ vs. /e/) and ending letters (/-er/ vs. /-s*/), both share the same consonantal sound of /kz/. This is because English pronunciation often assimilates voiceless al
o'kane, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two surnames "O'Kane" and "Bruner" do indeed share the same consonantal sound /n/. The difference lies in their respective vowels: O'Kane has a diphthong ("o") whereas Bruner contains the monophthongal vowel "/u/" (or sometimes pronounced as a schwa). This distinction justifies my affirmative response, indicating that they possess distinct yet similar characteristics within those names.<|eot_id|>
egert, gotta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "egret" has the consonants /g/, /r/, and /t/", while the word "got-ta" also contains the same consonants (/g/, /t/) in its respective letters, although with slight variations due to punctuation marks (the hyphen). The difference lies only in their vowels: "/e/" versus "/o/") respectively. Therefore, they share similar or even identical consonant sounds despite having distinct vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
kerby, aqaba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kerby" has the consonants /k/, /r/, /b/, and /y/. Meanwhile, the word "aqaba" has the consonants /q/, /a/, /b/, and no final consonant (since Arabic does not use vowels as separate phonemes). Although they share two similar-looking letters ("b"), their actual pronunciations differ due to language-specific differences in pronunciation (/b/ is voiced bilabial stop in English
homan, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "homan" has the consonants /m/, /n/ (twice), and no other distinct consonant sound, whereas the word "risner" also contains only one instance of each of the same three consonants: /r/, /s/, and /nr/. The difference lies in their respective vowels; "hom-an" vs. "ri-sn-er". Despite having similar consonantal patterns, they exhibit varying vocalic components, thus
tomato, timeout, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "t", "m", "p" in both "tomato" and "timeout" share similar or identical consonant sounds, whereas their corresponding vowels ("o", "i") differ significantly from one another. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with distinct vowel sounds between two words.<|eot_id|>
nex, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "nex" has the sound /nks/, which is composed of two distinct consonants: /n/ (the nasal stop) and /k/ (the voiceless velar plosive). The word "zeal", on the other hand, also starts with the combination /z/ + /l/. Although both combinations contain voiced stops (/s/ in "zeal"), they differ from each other due to their differing positions within the mouth and tongue movements involved when
panton, pantano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "panton" and "pantano" both contain the same consonants ("ntn") which sound alike, while their vowels differ: "a" in "pantan-o" vs. "-o" or no vowel at all (depending on pronunciation) in "pan-tan-o". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
peratis, pettus, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "peratis" and "pettis" (or more accurately, their Latin roots) share the same consonant sound /p/, /r/, /t*/, and /*s*/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "e", "a", "i"s vs. "e", "e", "u". The presence of distinct vowels despite shared consonants meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds. Therefore, my response is
royale, orel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "royal" has the sound /rɔiəl/, where "/r/" is the consonantal part, and "a", "o", and "el" make up the vocalic parts. The word "oreal" (or more commonly spelled as "oral") has the sound /ˈʊroʊl/, with again "/r/" being the common consonatal part, and this time, "/o/", "/u'", and "L".
sewed, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sewed" ends with the sound /d/, which is also present in the name "Jimmie". However, their vowels differ; "sewed" has the long 'e' sound (/iː/) while "jimmie" contains two short i-sounds (//). This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between them.<|eot_id|>
ocon, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word comparison is between "ocon" and "rasner". Both words contain the same set of consonants, which are /k/, /n/, and /r/. However, they differ in their vowels, with "ocon" having an "o" sound whereas "rasner" has distinct vowel sounds (/æ/) followed by another separate vowel sound (likely "/ɛ/" or "/ə"). Therefore, while sharing similar consonantal phonemes, the
schuller, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "schuler" has the consonants /ʃ/, /uːl/, and /r/, whereas the name "Arsenault" starts with the consonants /ɑrsnəlt/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/uː/ vs. /a/) and ending letters, both sequences of consonants ("ʃulr" and "ɡsnr") share similar phonetic characteristics (the voiceless postal
enex, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "en" has the same consonant sound /n/, while the word "kanner" also starts with the letter combination "kn", which can represent the same phoneme (/kn/) in some languages, including English (although not exactly alike). However, since we're considering only the initial consonants for this question, I'll focus on that part of their pronunciation.On the other hand, both words end differently: "en" ends with a schwa-like vowel sound
coiner, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "coiner" has the consonants /n/, /r/, and silent 'c', whereas the word "priam" also contains the same consonants (/n/, /r/) with no other distinct consonants in between them, indicating that they share similar or identical consonant sounds. However, their vowels differ: "/aɪ/" (long i) sound is present in both cases for "i", while there's only one instance of "/eɪ/"
aqaba, cab, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "aqaba" has the letter combination "-qb-" which represents the /kʷb/ sound, while the word "cab" also contains the letters "-cb-", representing the same /kb/ sound. Although they differ in their initial vowels ("a" vs. no-vowel), the consecutive consonants (/q/, /b/) share similar phonetic values, making them identical from that perspective. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do
lac, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lac" has the consonant sound /l/, while the word "chlorofluoro-" also starts with the same consonant sound /kl/. Although they share similar beginning letters, their ending parts differ in terms of vowels ("ac" vs "-fluoro-"). Therefore, I conclude that both sets of words contain identical consonant sounds (/k/) accompanied by distinct vowel patterns. Justification: The presence of matching initial consonants does not guarantee phonetic similarity; however
aird, rood, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "aird" has the /r/ sound as its only consonant, while the word "rood" also starts with the same /r/ sound (albeit pronounced slightly differently due to being part of a digraph). The difference lies in their vowels: "aird" ends with a silent /iː/ or long 'e' sound (/ɛərd/, approximately), whereas "rood" features a short /u�
ybanez, bono's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ybanez" has the consonant sound /b/, while the word "bono's" also starts with the same consonant sound /b/. The difference lies in their vowels: "ybanez" ends with the diphthong "/eɪ/" (as pronounced), whereas "bono's" is typically spoken as having two separate syllables, "bo-no", where each contains distinct vowel sounds (/ō/) or potentially other variations depending on regional
lackey, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "lackey" has the consonant sound /k/ followed by the vowel sound /æ/, while the word "chlorofluorocarbons" also starts with the same consonant sound /kl-/. The only difference is in their respective vowels, where "lackey" ends with /æ/ whereas "chlorofluorocarbons" contains various combinations of vowels (/oʊ/, /uːrɒmz/) that differ from
lyke, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "lyke" has the same consonants ("lk") as the word "like", whereas they differ in their vowels (the first one being pronounced like "/aɪk/" or similar, while the second one is typically pronounced with the diphthong "/ʌɪk/")). Similarly for "GermeR", which shares its consonantal sound (/rm/) with other English words having distinct vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
quito, keto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "quito" starts with the /k/ sound, which is also present in the word "keto". This indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/k/) despite having distinct vowels ("i" vs. "e"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, both words do contain identical consonant sounds but differ only in their respective vowel phonemes.<|eot_id|>
maids', meadows, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "maids'" has the sound /d͡ʒɪdz/ (the letter combination "-ds" is pronounced as a voiced postalveolar affricate), while the word "meadows" also starts with the same sound /m/. The difference lies in their vowels: "/aɪz/" for "maids'", versus "/iː" or open-mid front unrounded vowel, respectively) in "meadows". Therefore, they share similar conson
heman, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "heman" has the consonants /hmn/, while the word "reisenauer" also contains the same sequence of consonants (/rsnzr/) followed by other letters. Although they differ in their overall sound, shape, or position within each syllable, both sequences contain similar consecutive consonantal phonemes (m-n and r-s-z-r). However, since vowels play no role here, we can conclude that only the consonant patterns match between
melloan's, melons, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mellon"s has the consonants /l/, /n/', and's', while the word "melons" also has those same consonants: /l/, /n/', and's'. The difference lies in their respective vowels, which are /ɛˈloʊnz/ (long e sound) for "melon"s and /ˈmiːlzəns/ (short i sound followed by schwa) for "melons
kian, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kian" has the consonant sound /n/, while the word "jammer" also starts with the same consonant sound /m/. However, they differ in their initial vowels: "i" (in "kian") vs. "j" or silent "a" followed by "mm" which is pronounced as a single syllable starting with "/mj/" (in "jammer"). The presence of this difference justifies my affirmative response to your question.
kania, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "kanya" has the consonant sound /n/, while the word "prem" also has the same consonant sound /n/. The difference lies in their vowels: "a" (in "kania") vs. no vowel at all ("rem"). Although there is only one letter "e", its pronunciation as a silent or reduced vowel doesn't affect the presence of similar consonants between both words. Therefore, I conclude that they share identical consonant sounds (/
shill, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "sh" in both "shill" and "hammann" represent the same /ʃ/ sound, which is a voiceless postalveolar fricative (a type of consonantal sound). The presence or absence of this sound does not change across the two words. However, the vowels preceding them differ: "i" in "shill" versus "a" in "hamman(n)". This means they do indeed share similar consonant
pty, patois, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "pty" has the same consonant sound as the letters in the word "patois". The consonants /pt/, /t*/, and /*s*/ all share similar qualities, such as place of articulation (alveolar or postalveolar) and manner of articulation (stop). On the other hand, the vowels differ: "/y/" is often represented by the letter combination "uy", while "" represents the long-vowel sound /aː/.
isch, hsieh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response lies in the fact that "isch" and "hsieh" share similar consonantal phonemes /ʃ/, whereas their corresponding vowels differ: "/ɪ/" (short i) in "isch", and either "" or "", depending on pronunciation, which indicates distinctiveness between them. This distinction meets our criteria of having identical consonant sounds yet disparate vowel sounds within those two sets of letters.<|eot_id|>
tamke, tomko, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "m", "k" in both words ("tamke" and "tomko") represent similar or identical consonant phonemes, whereas their accompanying vowels differ: /æ/, /ɪ/. The presence of distinct vowel sounds distinguishes one word from another despite sharing common consonants.<|eot_id|>
settle, stille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "settle" has the consonants /stl/ while "stillle" (note that I assume you meant to type "stilled", not "stile") also starts with those same consonants, namely /s/, /t/, and /l/. However, their vowels differ; in "settled," we find two short 'e's (/et/) whereas in "stilled," there is one long 'i' followed by double 'L'.
ketch, cuccio, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ketch" has the consonant sound /tʃ/, which is also present in the Italian loanword "cuccio". However, their vowels differ; "ketch" ends with the diphthong "/ɛt/" (the "ch" being pronounced as a soft "c"), whereas "cuccio" features the pure vowel /uː/. Despite having similar starting letters ("K"/"C") followed by distinct vocal
fires, faz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "f" in both "fires" and "faze" represent the same sound, which is /f/. The vowels also change between the two words: "ires" has the long i sound (/aɪ/) while "aze" has the short æ (near-open front unrounded vowel) or sometimes pronounced as /eɪz/. Therefore, they share similar consonantal features with distinct vocalic differences.<|eot_id|>
pisa, pesce, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "pisa" has the consonants /ps/, while the word "pesce" also starts with the same combination of consonants, namely /ps/. However, they differ in their vowel sound: "i" (in Italian) vs. "e". The presence or absence of similar vowels does not change the fact that both words share the exact same consonantal sequence (/ps/) at the beginning. This meets the criteria specified by your question
arison, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "arision" (not found in my database, so I'll assume you meant to type "arrison") and "germen" both contain the same consonant sound /r/, which is not affected by changes in vowels between English words. However, their initial syllables differ in terms of vowel quality:* In "arison", there's no such word as far as my knowledge goes.* On the other hand, if we consider "arrison" instead
sawed, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sawed" has the consonant sound /d/, while the word "necase" (not "necaise", which is not a valid English word) also starts with the same consonant sound /k/. Although they start with similar consonants, their vowels differ ("a" in "sawed" vs. "e" or "i" depending on pronunciation of "necase"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the
aqaba, coby, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "aqaba" has the consonants /q/, /b*/, and */a*/ while the word "coby" has the consonants /k/, /b*, and /*y*. Although they differ in their vowels (/a/ vs./o/), both possess similar consonant sounds, specifically "/b/" which appears as identical in both cases. This similarity suggests that yes, indeed, there exist identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds between the two
kanai, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word combination "kanai" and "geme-me" can indeed exhibit similar consonant sounds, specifically the /n/, /k/, and /m/. However, their vowel patterns differ in that:- In "kanai", we find the diphthongal sound "/ka-nAi/" where both vowels share some similarity.- Meanwhile, "jeme" presents distinct single-vowel sounds as "/je-mE/", which don't match exactly with those found
sunday's, cernuda's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sunday" has the sound /nɪdʒ/ (the digraph combination of letters 'nd' making the voiced velar nasal stop followed by the voiceless palatal approximant) as its consonantal part, while the word "cernuda" also starts with the same sequence "/sn/" which is another way to write down this particular set of phonemes in IPA transcription system. The main difference lies within their vowels: Sunday ends up having the
imelda, millard, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification for this response is that the letters "m", "l", and "d" in both "Imelda" and "Millard" share similar or identical phonetic values, whereas the vowels ("i", "e") in "Imelda" differ from those (both double-"i"s) in "Millard". The presence of distinct vowel patterns distinguishes them despite having common consonants. This meets the criteria specified: identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
hohman, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "homan" has the same consonants ("hm") as in the phrase "ex-cell-ing", while having distinct vowels (the first one is silent, whereas the second set of letters forms part of the syllable). This meets the criteria for identifying similar consonant sounds with varying vowel patterns between two sets of words.<|eot_id|>
healthy, zulu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "healthy" has the consonants /h/, /lty, while the Zulu language's pronunciation of "zulu" typically starts with /zu/. Although both words end in "-ly", their initial consonantal sound is distinct (/hl- vs./ zu-). The vowels also differ: "/e/" in "health-y" versus possibly no explicit vowel sound or another vowel (like /u/) in "ZU-lu". Therefore, they do not share identical
hamner, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "h" and "n", as well as the letters "x" and "nn", represent similar or identical consonant sounds in both "hamner" and "annex". The difference lies only in their corresponding vowels, which are /æmˈɛr/ (am-RER) for "hamner" versus /əˈnekʰs/ (/uh-NEXK-s/) for "annex".In phonetics
node, nader, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "node" ends with the /d/ sound, which is also present in the suffix "-der" of the second word "nader". This means they share the same consonantal ending /-ed/. The difference lies only in their vowels: "ode" vs "a", respectively. Hence, we can conclude that despite having distinct meanings, both words exhibit similar consonance (the presence of /d/) while differing in vocalic quality.<|eot_id|>
leaps, lopes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "leaps" and "lopes" share the same consonants ("p", "s") with similar pronunciation, while having distinct vowels: /iː/ (long i) in "leaps" vs. /oʊz/ (oh-zuh) in "lopes". The difference lies solely in their vowel patterns, making them examples of homographs that differ only in vowel sound.<|eot_id|>
seider, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seider" has the consonants /s/, /d/, and /r/. Similarly, the word "alcoa"s (note that I assume you meant to write "Alcoa", which is likely referring to Alcoa Inc., not some other entity) also contains those same consonants (/l/, /c/, /w/, or sometimes written as /k/) in its spelling. However, their vowels differ - "eideR"
shelly, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shelly" has the sound /lly/, which consists of two distinct consonants (/ll/) followed by another single consonant (/y/). The word "primo", on the other hand, starts with the digraph "/pm/" (which represents one phoneme), not separate consonant sounds like in "shelly". Additionally, while both words end with -y or i respectively, this does not change their initial consonantal patterns. Therefore
lookers, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "looker" has the same consonant sound /kər/ as the word "roser", while they differ in their vowels, with "o" vs. "o". This is because both letters 'O' can represent distinct phonemes (units of sound) depending on context and pronunciation. In this case, we consider them to have different vowel qualities or heights (/ʊ/, for example). The difference lies not only between short and long forms ('u',
divi, devaux, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word pair "divi" and "devaux" do indeed share the same consonant sound, which is /v/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds - "/ɪ/" (short 'i') for "divi", versus no vowels present ("eau") for "devaux". This meets the criteria of having distinct yet similar parts between them.<|eot_id|>
platz, palazzi, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "platz" and "palazzi" do indeed share the same consonant sound, which is /pl/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "platz" has a short "a" (/pɫats/) while "palazzi" has multiple vowels ("pa-laz-zi"). This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds (the /pl/ combination) with differing vowel sounds between two distinct words.<|eot_id|>
koehn, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:In the word "koen", there is no distinct sound of /k/. The letter combination "oe" forms a diphthong, which can approximate to the long vowel sound in English ("oy"). In contrast, when we look at the second part -kapuscinski-, there's also not much emphasis on individual letters' pronunciation; instead, the syllable structure plays more significant role (Ka-pu-ski-nski). Here, one might
soeder, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "soeder" has the consonants /s/, /d/, and /r*/, whereas the word "prima" also contains those same consonants (/p/', /m', and /r*/). The only difference between them lies in their respective vowels, which are distinct: "/oʊ/" for "soeder", versus "/aɪ/" or simply "/" (no vowel) followed by "" for "prima". This meets the criteria
lech, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two word pairs "lech" and "germ(e)" share the same consonant sound /kʰ/, whereas they differ in their vowel sounds, with "leh-" having a short 'e' (ɛ) and "germ-e" having a long 'er-' followed by a schwa ('ə'). This meets the criteria for identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
leiby, laborer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "leiby" has the letter combination "-br-", which represents the /bər/ sound, whereas in the word "laborer", we find the letters "-rb-" representing the same /ɹb/ sound (note that this is often transcribed as /ʁ/, depending on the phonetic transcription system used). Although they differ slightly due to their positions within each word ("-ibr-" vs. "-orb"), both instances represent essentially
eckerd, cod, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "eckerd" contains the sound /k/, which appears in both words.* The word "cod" also contains the same sound /d/.* Since they share similar consonants (/k/ and /d/) with distinct vowels (the first one has possibly long 'e' or short 'i', while the second one can represent various English diphthongs), we conclude that yes, the two words do contain identical consonant sounds
raine, arian, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "rain" has the sound /r/, which is also present in the word "rian". Similarly, both words contain the sound /n/. However, their vowels differ - "ain" (in "rain") vs. "i" or "a" (depending on pronunciation) in "rian"). Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (/rn/) with distinct vowel phonemes.<|eot_id|>
actor, keto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "ctor" in both "actor" and "keto" share similar consonant sounds, which include /t/, /r/. However, their vowels differ: "a" in "actor" versus "e" in "keto". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
chalet, haman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "chalet" has the consonants /ch/, /l/, and /t/. Meanwhile, the word "heman" (I assume you meant to type "Hamen", as in Haman from biblical times) also contains the same set of consonants (/h/, /m/, and /n/) with similar pronunciation patterns. Although they differ in their starting vowels ("cha-" vs "-he-"), the similarity between the consecutive consonantal phonemes makes
schley, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schley" has the sound /ʃlɛi/, where "/ˈʃ/" represents the voiceless postalveolar fricative (a type of consonantal sound), "/" is the letter combination, and "/eɪ/" represent the diphthong pronunciation with the letters's', 'h' and 'le'. On the other hand, "coiner" starts with the sound /kwaɪnər
schley, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sch" in "Schley" has the same sound as the prefix "br-" in "Brony", which indicates they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/ʃ/) / (b). On the other hand, their vowels differ: "ey" in Schley vs. "o" in Brony. This difference justifies my affirmative response to your question about whether the two words exhibit distinct yet matching consonants with varying vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
idle, daly, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "idle" has the consonant sound /dɪl/ (the combination of the letters 'i', 'l' and 'e'), while the word "daily" also starts with the same consonant sound /deɪli/. The only difference is in their respective vowels, where "idel" ends with a single-vowel ("-le") whereas "daily" contains two separate vowels ("-ai"). This makes them distinct yet share similar consonants. Justification
barstow, brust, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the words "barstow" and "brust" do indeed share similar or identical consonant sounds, specifically /r/, /s/, /t/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "/ar/" (short 'a' sound) for "barstow", versus no vowels (/b/r/s/t/) for "brust". This distinction meets the criteria of having distinct consonant sounds with varying vowel patterns between two words.<|eot_id|>
alcoa's, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "alcoa" has the consonants /l/, /c/, and /s", while the word "roseane" (I assume you meant to type "rosine") also contains those same consonants: /r/, /z*/, and /n/. However, their vowels differ in both sound and quality:* In "alcoa," there's no specific vowel; instead, we find a combination of diphthongs (/ælk
obryan, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "obrian" starts with the sound /b/, which means that both instances of this letter share the same consonantal phoneme.* Similarly, in the second part "-gen", we can see two occurrences of the letters 'g' and 'n', respectively. These also form identical pairs when considering their consonantal values (/ɡ/) or (ŋ)) within each syllable.* Lastly, comparing the vowels between these parts reveals
breth, broth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "breath" has the letter combination /θrɛð/, where "/θ/" represents the voiceless interdental fricative sound, which is often transcribed as th in English (like in "this"), and "/ɛ/" represents the open mid front unrounded vowel sound.On the other hand, the word "broth" has the letter combination /brɔθ/, where again "/θ/" represents the same voiceless interdental fr
billiter, balletto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "billiter" and "balletto" share the same initial consonants /bl/, which is their common feature among other letters in each word, including vowels like "/i/" or "/e/", respectively. However, they differ significantly with respect to their middle letter combinations ("ill", "al") and ending characters ("ter," "etto"). Nevertheless, despite some differences within those variations, both words exhibit distinct patterns that set them apart from one another while also
sued, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sued" ends with the /d/ sound, which is also present in the word "cannery". The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "u" vs. no vowel (silent 'e' at the end of "can-"). This justifies my affirmative response because both words share similar consonants (/d/) despite having distinct vocalic components ("u", none).<|eot_id|>
demeans, dominoes, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "demean" has the consonants /m/, /n/ (or sometimes /ŋ/) and /s/, whereas the word "dominoes" also contains those same consonants (/m/, /n/ or /ŋ/, and /s/). The only difference between them lies in their respective vowels: "ee" in "demean" versus various combinations of letters representing distinct vowel phonemes ("o", "i", etc.)
cod, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cod" has the /k/ sound, which is also present in the word "local". Additionally, both words contain no other distinct consonants that would affect their pronunciation differently from each other (e.g., there's only one 'l' or any other letter). Therefore, despite having different vowels ("o" vs. various combinations of letters), they share similar consonantal phonemes (/k/) when spoken aloud. This meets the criteria for identical consonant
atek, tokio, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "atek" and "Tokyo" share the same consonantal sound /t/, which is followed by distinct vocalic sounds in each word, respectively, "/e/" (in "atek") and "/o/" (in "Tokyo"). This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds between them.<|eot_id|>
dewinter, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "dew" has the same consonants (/dw/) as the word "kern", while they differ in their vowels ("e" vs. "er"). Therefore, according to phonological criteria, we can conclude that these two words share similar consonantal features (identical) with distinct vocalic components (different).<|eot_id|>
barstow, braced, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "barstow" has the consonants /br/, /s/, /t/, /w/. The word "braced" also contains similar consonants, namely /b/, /r**, /c**ed (which is pronounced as /tsd/) where ** represents voiceless stops. Since they share common consonantal phonemes (/b/, /r/, /t/, /s/, and /d/s), I conclude that yes, both words do contain identical conson
immel, mealy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification for this is that the word "immel" has two distinct letters with similar or identical consonant sound: /m/. The first letter 'M' in "immel" represents the voiced bilabial nasal stop, whereas the second letter 'M' also denotes the same phoneme (the voiceless labiodental fricative). On the other hand, both instances of 'e', followed by either '-a-' or '-ae-', exhibit varying vowel qualities (/�
hayton, huttner, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "t" in both "hayton" and "huttner" represent the same /t/ sound, which is a stop consonantal voiceless alveolar plosive (the tongue touches or approaches just behind the upper teeth). The vowels preceding this consonant differ: "a" in "hayton" versus "u" in "huttner". Since they share similar initial consonants (/t/) with distinct following vowels ("a"/
laborer, allbee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "laborer" has the sound /bərʊɹər/, while the word "all bee" is pronounced as "/ælbē/. Although they differ in their vowels, both contain the same consonantal sound sequence of /lab-/, which includes the letters L-B-R. This satisfies the condition that the two sets of words share identical consonants (L-B-R) with distinct vowel sounds (/u:/ vs./ae/) between
agner, eagen, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "agner" and "-eegen" share similar or identical consonant sounds, specifically /g/, /n/, and /r/. However, they differ in their corresponding vowel sounds: "/a/" vs. "/ee/") respectively. The presence of distinct vowels while maintaining similarity among consonants satisfies this condition.<|eot_id|>
sheely, shiloh, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "sh" in both "sheely" and "Shiloh" represent the same phoneme, which means they produce the same sound (/ʃ/) when pronounced by most English speakers. This makes them identical consonant sounds.On the other hand, the vowels /iː/, /ɪliənbaum/ (in "Sheely") vs. /oʊlōh/ (in "Shiloh") differ significantly
guertin, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "guertin" has the consonants /g/, /r/, /t**,and **n** (where * denotes distinct letters), while the word "brunner" also contains the same set of consonants: /b/, /r/, /n/. The difference lies in their respective vowels, where "guertin" starts with "/u/" followed by other vowels (/eɪ/r/) whereas "brunner" begins with "/b
garroz, gruis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The two-word pair "garroz" and "gruis" do indeed share the same consonantal sound /r/. However, they differ in their vocalic components (/ar/) vs./uɪz/). This meets one of the criteria for having distinct phonetic properties despite being written similarly (homophonic confusion is not guaranteed due to differing vowels).<|eot_id|>
zalay, zil, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zalay" has the sound /zl/, which is repeated in the second half of the phrase, spelled as "zil". Both instances share the same consonantal sound (/z/) followed by distinct vowels ("a" vs. none). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds between them.<|eot_id|>
cod, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cod" has the consonant sound /kɒd/, while "incase" has the same consonants, namely "/n/", "/", and "". However, they differ in their vowels; specifically, "" is replaced by "", which changes the overall pronunciation of each word. Therefore, I conclude that yes, both words share identical consonant sounds (/knse/) with distinct vowel patterns ("" vs "").<|eot_id|>
rotan, return, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "rotan" and "return" both contain the same set of consonants: /r/, /t*/, and /n/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds:* In "rotan", there's no vowel sound (/ə/ or schwa) after the initial consonantal cluster.* In contrast, "return" has two distinct vowels: /ɪˈrʌn/.Since only one word contains a full-fledged
highman, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "high" has the /hɪ/ sound, whereas the word "knack" has the /næk/ sound. Although they differ in their vowels (/i/ vs./æk/, respectively), both contain similar consonantal sounds of /h/ (in "high") and /k/ and/or /n/ (in "knack"). The distinction lies not only with phonemes like voiced/unvoiced stops or continuants versus liquids
sowder, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the letters "d" in both "sowder" and "nyx" represent the same sound /d/, which means they share the same consonant phoneme (the smallest unit of speech). However, the vowels preceding them differ: "o" in "sowder" versus no vowel at all ("y") in "nyx". This difference in vowel quality or absence leads to distinct pronunciations between the two words, despite their
eichner, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "eichner" has the consonants /ch/, /n/, and /r/. Meanwhile, the word "borneo" also contains the same consonants (/b/) followed by distinct vowels ("er"). This suggests that they share similar or identical consonant sounds while having varying vowel phonemes (the sound of letters A, E, I, O, U). Therefore, my response is affirmative in this case.<|eot_id|>
owned, indy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "owned" ends with the sound /nd/, which is also present in the word "indy". However, they differ in their initial vowels: "own-" starts with a diphthong (/aʊ/) while "-dy" begins with a single vowel phoneme (/ɪ/). This means that although both words share similar consonantal endings (-nd-), they exhibit distinct vocalic onsets (initial vowels) due to differences in pronunciation. Therefore, I conclude
haggart, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "haggard" has the consonants /g/, /r/, /d/. On the other hand, the word "enigma" also contains the same set of consonants (/n/, not considered in this case as it's part of another syllable) - /m-, g-. Although they differ by their vowels ("a", "e"), both share similar patterns with regards to consonantal phonemes. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, there exist
knicks', kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "knicks'" has the consonants /k/, /n*/, and/or */ks*/ (the exact sequence is unclear due to lack of context), while the word "kanne" also contains the same set of consonants (/k/, /n*, *an*). However, their vowels differ; in "knicks'", we find either /ɪ/ or possibly another sound depending on pronunciation, whereas in "kanne", there's likely a more
saudi, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "saudi" has the consonants /sd/, while the word "osler" also starts with the same consonants /sl/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/a/ vs. /o/) and ending letters, both share similar starting consonant phonemes (the combination of sound produced by two or more adjacent speech organs). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these words do exhibit identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
majeske, maruska, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "majeske" has the letter combination "-jes-" which contains the same consonants /j/, /s/. On the other hand, in the word "maruska", we find another set of letters with similar sound properties: "/r/", "/u/" (or sometimes pronounced as /ʊ/) followed by "-ska". Both sets contain distinct consonantal elements (/j/s vs./r/u) despite having varying vowels attached to them. Therefore
sidor, gummi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sidor" has the consonant sound /dɹ/ (the combination of the voiced dental fricative /ð/ and the liquid approximant /r/) in both positions, while the vowels differ: "/a/" vs. none (since there is no vowel after the first consonantal cluster). Similarly for the second pair of letters-"gumi", which also share similar consonants (/m/, /u/") with distinct vowels ("/i"/ vs. none
astra, storey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "str" in both "astra" and "storey" represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes, whereas the vowels differ: "astr-" has the sound /ɑːr/ (the long 'a' followed by the voiced postalveolar fricative), while "-ory" has the diphthongal sound /oʊri/. The similarity between their consonants outweighs any differences in pronunciation due to distinct vowel
imes, mae's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "imes" has the consonants /mz/ (the combination of the letters "m", "s") while the word "'mae"s has the consonants /meɪz/. Although they don't share exact matching consonant combinations, both sets contain similar sound patterns: "/ms/" in "imes" can be considered as having a similar sound to "/meiz/" or "/mayz/" in "'mae"s". This similarity is due to phonetic similarities between
casinos, axons, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "casinos" has the sound /sɪnəzōʊz/ (sin-o-zohz), whereas the word "axon"s has the sound /æksɒnz/ (ak-sonz). Although they share some similar letters, their consonantal patterns differ in that:* In "casinos", we find the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/, while in "axios", there is no such letter.
foth, fauth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "th" in both "foth" and "fath" (or more accurately, their phonetic pronunciations /ɒθ/ and /faʊð/) represent the same consonantal sound (/θ/, also known as interdental fricative), which remains unchanged between the two words. The difference lies solely in their respective vowels: "/o/" vs. "/aʊ/", respectively. This meets the criteria for having identical
coriander, craned, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "coriander" has the consonants /r/, /n*/, and */d*/ (where * denotes that the sound is not pronounced), while "craned" also contains the same set of consonants (/r/, /n*, and */d*/), differing only in their respective vowels ("o", "a"). This indicates that they share similar, yet distinct, consonantal properties despite having varying vocalic components. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the
marleene, marilyn, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the words "Marlene" and "Marilyn" both start with the same consonant sound /m/, followed by distinct vowel combinations: "/ɑr/" in Marlene vs. "/aɪ/" in Marilyn. Although they share similar spellings, their pronunciation differs due to varying vowels following the initial consonants.<|eot_id|>
sidi, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidi" has the same consonant sound /dɪdiː/ as in "high", which is pronounced with a voiceless alveolar stop followed by two i-vowels, whereas the rest of the letters ("h-man") do not share this feature. Therefore, only the initial consonants (/si/) match between both words, while their vowels differ (the first one being long 'i', and the second one being silent).
schuler, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schuler" has the consonants /ʃ/, /uːlər/. The word "jimmie" has the consonants /d͡ʒɪmɪ(). Although they don't share any exact letters, both contain similar consonantal features: in "schuler", we find the voiceless postalveolar fricative (/ʃ/) which is also present as [t͡ʃ] or [s̠
tokio, tek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "tok" and "teck" contain identical consonant sounds, which are /k/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "o" (in "tok") versus "e" (in "teck"). This meets the criteria for having distinct yet similar consonants with varying vowels.<|eot_id|>
laack, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "laack" has the consonants /lk/, while the word "germer" also contains the same sequence of consonants, namely /r/m/r/. Although they differ in their vowels (/a/ vs./e/) and possibly other aspects like prefix or suffixes, the consonant sound pattern is indeed identical between the two words ("laack" and "germer").<|eot_id|>
stalowa, astley, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the word "stalowa" has the consonants /stlwna/, while the word "Astley" has the consonants /s/t/l/i/. Although they differ in their vowels (/alowaa/ vs. /ɑːsti/), both possess similar consonantal patterns, specifically:* The initial sound "/st/" appears twice.* Both contain the lateral liquid consonant "/L/", followed by another consonant ("n", then "
seider, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seider" has the consonants /s/, /d/, and /r/. Similarly, the word "bran" also contains the same set of consonants (/b/, /r/, and /n). However, their vowels differ - "e", "i", "er" in "seider" versus "a" and no additional vowel sound ("ran") in "bran". Since only the vowel sounds vary while the consonantal parts remain
brethauer, broth, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "breath" (or its variant, "breathe") and "brother" share the same consonant sound /θr/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds - "/ɛ/" for "breadh/breath" versus "/oʊ/" or "/ə/" for "broth"-er". This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between two words.<|eot_id|>
kin, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kin" has a /kɪn/ sound, whereas the word "generer" (assuming you meant to type "generator") starts with "/dʒɛnjərətər/" which doesn't match exactly in terms of consonants ("j" vs. "k"). However, if we ignore the difference between voiced/unvoiced stops (/g/k/) and focus on the remaining letters (-rm), they share similar
lyke, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "lyke" and "smoken" do not exist in standard English language, they seem to be misspelled or altered forms of actual words. However, if we assume the correct spellings as "like" and "smoke", then:* In the word "like", there is no distinct consonant sound.* In the word "smoked", the repeated 'k' represents a single /ːɡʷən �
shiller, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "r" in both "shiller-" and "-rosten" represent identical /r/ sound, which is a consonantal phoneme (a single unit of distinct speech). The vowels preceding them differ: "i" in "shiller-" vs. "o" in "-rosten". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
treen, tyrone, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "treen" has the consonant sound /tr/, while the word "Tyrone" also starts with the same consonant sound /tr/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds - "e" vs. "y". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
aird, roadie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "aird" has the sound /rd/, which matches with the same consonant sound in the word "road", also pronounced as /rɒd/. The difference lies only in their vowels, where "aird" ends with the diphthong "ai" while "road" uses a single vowel "o". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /rd/) despite varying vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
retool, rattler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "retool" starts with the sound /r/, followed by the silent letter combination "t", then the vowel sound "/u/" (as in "boot"), and finally ends with the suffix "-ool". On the other hand, the word "rattler" also begins with the sound /r/, is followed by the single-letter consonant "t", has the same vowel sound as before ("a") like "cat", and concludes with the ending "-er".Although
dedeaux, dud, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the two pairs of letters "ded" in "dedeaux" and "dud" both contain the same consonants /d/, /d/. However, they differ in their respective vowels: "ed" has long "ee" sound (in American English) or silent "eh" followed by schwa ("ə") sound (in British English), while "u" in "du" makes a short close-mid back rounded vowel (/ʊ/)
tidy, todo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "t", "d" in both "tidy" and "todo" represent similar or identical consonantal phonemes (/t/), whereas their corresponding vowels "/i/" (in "tidy") and "/o/" (in "todo") differ, resulting in distinct pronunciations for each word despite sharing common initial consonants.<|eot_id|>
husky, hasek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "husky" has the consonants /sk/, while the word "hasek" also starts with the same sequence of consonants, namely "/hs/. However, they differ in their vowels: "us-" (in "husky") versus "a-" or no vowel sound at all (since Czech language's pronunciation is often transcribed without diacritical marks). This justifies my initial yes response that both words share identical consonant sounds (/s/) but not
summaries, semis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "s" in the two words ("summaries", "semis") share similar characteristics, being voiced alveolar fricatives /z/. This means they produce the same sound when pronounced by native English speakers. On the other hand, the vowels differ between the two words - "u" is present in "summaries," while there's no "u" (or any long-vowel combination) in "semis." Therefore, we can conclude that
boat's, butzer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "boat" has the sound /bɔt/, where "/b/" is a voiced bilabial stop, "/o/" is a close-mid back rounded vowel, and "/t/" is a voiceless alveolar stop.On the other hand, the German surname "Bützer" (pronounced [ˈbytsər]) has the sound /bʏt͡sɐ̯/, where "/b/" again represents a
egnor, agne, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "g", "n", and "r" in both "engnor" and "agnes" share similar or identical phonetic values, whereas their vowels differ: /ɛŋˈnɔr/ (en-GH-nor) vs. /eɪˈneɪʒəz/. The presence of distinct vowel patterns distinguishes these two word combinations despite having matching consonants.<|eot_id|>
acid, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "acid" ends with the sound /cid/, which has the same consonant sound as the suffix "-next", which also ends in the sound /nt/. The only difference between them is their respective vowels, where "acid" has a short 'i' (ɪ) while "next" has a long 'e'. This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
gamboa, gumbo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gambo" in "Gamboa" has the same consonants as "bumb" in "Gumbo", which are both /m/, /b/. The only difference between them lies in their vowels, where "a" appears before those consonants in "Gamboa", while "u" does so in "gumBO". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (the pair "/mb/") with different vowel sounds ("a"/
sacred, scored, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sacred" has the letter combination "/skrɛd/" while the word "scored" has the letters "/skoʊrd/'. Although they differ in their vowels, both words share similar consonant sound patterns (/k/, /r/) which makes them phonetically equivalent. This is known as homophony where two or more distinct sequences of speech sounds (phonemes) that correspond to different written forms can still evoke similar auditory experiences when
hermann, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The two sets of letters "her" in the word "Hermann" and "nec-" in the word "Nécaise" both contain the same consonant sound /hər/, which is pronounced similarly, if not identically. However, they differ significantly in their vowel sounds: the first set has a long-vowel combination (ɛː) while the second one has a nasalized open-mid front unrounded vowel (/ɛ̃/) followed by another
knocked, ancheta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "knocked" has the consonant sound /k/, while the word "anchorita" (not "ancheta", which is not a valid Spanish surname) also starts with the same consonant sound "/n"/, followed by the vowels "a". Although they differ in their starting letters ("K" vs. "N"), both words share similar consonantal phonemes (/k/ or /n/) that can be considered as having identical consonant sounds despite
geac, gekko, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "geak" has the letter combination /gæk/, which contains two distinct consonantal phonemes (/g/) and (/. On the other hand, in the word "gecko", we find another pair of letters with similar characteristics: /gtkō/. Both pairs share the same initial sound "/g/" as their common consonance, while differing significantly in terms of vocalic quality ("a" versus "o"). This difference is sufficient to conclude that they do
shirlee, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shirlee" has the sound /r/ (the letter combination 'er' in this case) as its consonant, which is also present in the word "boren". However, their vowels differ; "shirlee" ends with the long-vowel sound "/i/" while "boren" ends with the short-vowel sound '/ɔn/'. Despite having similar consonants (/r/,), they exhibit distinct vowel patterns, making them
lookers, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "looker" has the consonants /l/, /k/, and /r/. These same consonants appear in the word "enix". Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (/lk-r). However, their vowels differ; "/u/" appears in "looker", while there is no explicit vowel sound ("i") or any other vowel sound in "enix". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
hannes, hens, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hannes" has the sound /nns/, which is identical to the sound in the word "hens". The only difference between them is their vowel sounds, with "hannes" having two distinct vowels (/a/) while "hens" has one single vowel sound (/ɛ/). Therefore, I conclude that they share identical consonant sounds but differ in their vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
day's, owades, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The word "day" has the consonant sound /d/, while the word "owe" (in "owade") also starts with this same consonant sound (/w/ is often pronounced as /v/) followed by a distinct vowel sound "/oʊ/" in both cases, respectively). The main difference lies between their vowels: 'a' vs '/oʊ/' or '/uː/'. This meets the condition of having identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds.
cowen, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cowen" and "bruneY" do indeed share the same consonant sound, which is /n/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "owen" has the diphthong /oʊən/, while "BrunEy" (assuming you meant to type "Brunei") contains the monophthongs /uːi/. Since only one of them meets this specific criteria regarding vowel quality, I conclude
cod, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cod" has the consonant sound /kɒd/, while the word "chloro-" in "cholorofluorocarbons" starts with the same consonant sound /klərō/. The two sets of vowels, however, differ: "/ɔd/" versus "/ʊ/" (in "fluoro-") or "/uː/" (in "-carb-ons"). Despite having distinct meanings and pronunciations for each part
scholey, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholey" ends with the sound /ly/, which is also present in the word "next". Both words share this same consonantal ending, while having distinct vowels ("o-e" vs "-e-"). This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (in this case, "/l/" followed by "/y"/) but differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
interact, ancheta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "interact" has the consonants /n/, /t/, /r/, /c/ (or sometimes /k/) and/or other letters, whereas "Ancheta" also contains some of those same consonants (/nt/, /ct/, etc.). However, when comparing their consonant sounds alone, they appear to match or share similar patterns in terms of phonetics. On the contrary, their vowels differ; specifically:* In "interact",
lookers, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "looker" has the consonants /lkrs/, while the word "brawn-y" (note: not braw-ny) has the consonants /brn/. The initial consonantal sound in both words is similar, with a voiceless velar stop (/k/) followed by a liquid or fricative sound (/r/s). However, they differ in their vocalization due to distinct vowels following each of those consonants. In "
berber, baba, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "berber" has the consonants /b/, /r/, and /b/, while the word "babba" also contains those same consonants: /b/, /b/. The only difference is in their vowels, where "berber" ends with "/er/" (a diphthong) whereas "babba" has two consecutive instances of the vowel sound "/ɑ:/". Despite this variation, both pairs share similar consonantal phonemes (/br/)
hun, hany, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hun" has the same consonant sound /n/, while having a short vowel sound, whereas the word "Hony" (or more commonly spelled as "Honny") also starts with the same consonant sound /hn/. However, in this case, we see a difference between long and short vowels: the first one being pronounced shorter than the second one. This meets our criteria for matching consonants yet differing vowels.<|eot_id|>
sighed, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sighed" has the sound /dʒ/ (the combination of the voiced postalveolar affricate [z] + the voiceless dental fricative [θ]) in its consonants, whereas the word "elcoteL" does not contain this exact same sequence of sounds. However, they do share some commonalities:* Both start with the voiced palatal approximant /j/* They both end with a
sued, gemmer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the word "sued" has the sound /sdʒɛd/, where "/sd/" represents the same consonant phoneme, while the vowels are different (/eː/different from /əmər/) in comparison to the word "gemmer", which also contains the same consonant phonemes ("gm") with distinct vowel sounds (/i:/ vs /ɪr/. The difference lies solely on their respective vocalic components).<|eot_id|>
sowed, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sow" in "sowed" has the same /s/, /w/, and silent final letter as the root of the adjective "brawn", which is pronounced with the long 'o' sound, making both pairs share similar consonantal sounds (/swɔd/ vs./brən'i/) despite having distinct vowels (/ou̯/ vs./aʊ/). The justification for this response lies in phonological analysis where we compare not only individual
cernuda's, sounds, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cern" in "cernuda"sounds contain the same consonants /k/, /r/, and /n/. However, they differ in their vowels (/ɛrnˈduːdəs/) versus (no specific vowel sound mentioned). Since only the vowel sounds vary while maintaining similar consonantal patterns, I conclude that yes, indeed, both sets of words share identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
tay, utt, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "tay" has the same consonant sound /t/, while "utt" also shares the same consonant sound /tt/. The difference lies in their vowels, where "tay" ends with the vowel sound /ɛy/ (like in "play") whereas "utt" terminates with the diphthong /ʊə/ or simply the monophthalic vowel /uː/ (long 'oo' like in "boot"). Therefore,
bruner, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bruner" has the consonants /b/, /r/, /n/, /r/, while the word "Locatelli" has the same set of consonants, namely /l/, /k**,t*/, /l/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/b**u/** vs **lo**) and final syllables (/*ern*/ vs /*ell*i*/), both sets share similar consecutive consonantal patterns ("rn", "rt"), which suggests
schiller, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "sch" and "kn" represent distinct consonantal phonemes, which means they make similar yet not exactly alike sounds when pronounced in English. The sound /ʃ/ (as in "sh") differs from the sound /n/ (the nasal stop) even though both appear as single characters or digraphs respectively. Meanwhile, their accompanying vowels ("i", "e" for the first word; "a" in Ken) differ
ceder, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ceder" has the sound /s/, which is also present in the word "prem-o". The two words differ only in their vowels, with "ceder" having the diphthong "/iɪ/" (ee) while "prem-" has the single vowel "/e/. Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (/p/, /r/, /m/) but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
sheeler, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheeler" has the consonants /sh/, /l/, and /r/", whereas the word "health-y" (note that I assume you meant to type "healthy", not "heathly") also contains those same consonants (/h/, /l/, and /th/). However, their vowels differ - in "sheeler," there is no clear distinct vowel sound ("ee"), while in "healthy," we find two separate vowel sounds ("/
saad, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "saad" has the same consonant sound /d/, while "acona" also contains the same consonant sound /n/. The vowels, however, differ: in "saad", there is no distinct vowel (it's more of a silent letter), whereas in "acona", we see two distinct vowels (/a/ followed by /o/) with varying pitches or pronunciations depending on language context). Since both instances share similar consonants but disparate vowels,
cede, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cede" has the consonant sound /sɛd/ (the letter combination 'c' is silent), while the word "lockers" also contains the same consonant sound /kərz/. The difference lies in their respective vowels: "e" in "cede" vs. various vowel combinations ("o", "ck") in "lockers". Despite this, they share similar consonantal characteristics (/ks/) that remain consistent across both words.<|eot_id|>
moulin, milone, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "moulin" has the sound /nɛ̃l/, where "/n/" is a nasal consonant, followed by "/ɛ/" (a mid-central open unrounded front vowel), then "/l/" (alveolar lateral approximant) and finally "/n/" again.On the other hand, the word "milone" has the sound /miˈlo.ne/, where "/m/" is bilabial voiced stop, followed by "/
sheeler, contusion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheeler" has the consonants /sh/, /l/, and /r/. Meanwhile, the word "contusion" also contains the same set of consonants (/kɑnˈtjuʒən/) - namely, /c/t/n/j/sh/u/s/n. Although they differ in their respective vowels (e/i), both words share similar consonantal patterns. This similarity is what justifies my affirmative response to your query about
quito, ector, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "quito" has the letter combination "-q-t-" which is repeated in the second part of the compound word, "lector". This suggests that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/k/ /t/) despite having distinct vowels ("i", "e"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two parts of the compound word do indeed contain identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
tyrone, terrien, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The words "tyrone" and "Terien" (or Terrién) may not appear to share any similarities at first glance, but upon closer examination of their phonetic composition, we can identify the following:* Both words start with /t/, which is the same consonantal sound.* In both cases, there's no difference in the preceding or succeeding letters that would affect this initial consonant sound (/t/) differently between the two words.However, when
kain, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.Justification: The word "kain" has the sound /n/, which is also present in the word "brun". This indicates that they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/n/) despite having distinct vowels ("i" vs. "u"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two sets of letters do indeed possess identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
came, cam, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "came" has the same consonant sound /kæm/ as the word "cam", which is also pronounced with the same consonant sound /kɑːm/. The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "ame" (in "came") versus "a" (in "cam"). Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed share similar consonant sounds despite having distinct vowel pronunciations.<|eot_id|>
cane, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cane" has the consonant sound /n/, while the word "brun" also has the same consonant sound /n/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "can-e" (the two vowels) is pronounced differently from "b-r-u-n". This indicates that despite having similar consonants (/n/) between them, the overall pronunciation of each word differs due to distinct vowel combinations.<|eot_id|>
briner, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "r", "n" and "m" in both "briner" and "jimi" represent similar or identical consonant sounds, whereas the vowels ("i") differ between the two words. The presence of distinct vowel sounds distinguishes them phonetically despite sharing common consonants.<|eot_id|>
shaul, petrilli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "shaul" and "petrilli" do not contain the same set of letters, so we cannot directly compare their consonants or vowels. However, if we break down each word into its individual phonemes (smallest units of sound), we can analyze them separately:* In "shaul", there is no distinct consonant cluster; instead, you'll find:	+ /ʃ/ - voiceless postalveolar fricative
behalf, behof, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "behalf" and "behold" differ only in their vowels, with the former having /æf/ (the letter combination 'af' pronounced as one sound) and the latter having /oʊl/. However, they share similar consonantal sequences of /b/, /h/', and/or /lf', which can be considered equivalent or identical for phonological purposes. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, despite differing vocalic components, both words possess
grue, gore, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "r", "u" and "e" in the word "grue" form the same sound as the letter combination "-or-" in the word "gore". The /r/, /uː/ (long u) and /iː/ (long e) phonemes remain constant, while only the vowels change from "/ju/" to "/ɔər/", resulting in distinct yet homophonous words with respect to
knocked, nichter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "knocked" has the sound /n/, /k/, and /d/ as its consonants, whereas the word "nighter" also starts with the same set of consonants (/n/, /t/, and /r/) although in this case they appear differently due to their position within each word. The difference lies solely in the vowels: 'o' (in "knocked") vs. 'i', 'e' or possibly even '
hsieh, shurr, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "hsieh" (pronounced as /ʃiɛ/) and "shur-r" (/ˈʂuər/) both contain the same set of consonants, which is "/s", "/", and "-". However, they differ in their vowel sounds - "hsieh" has the diphthong sound /ei/, while "shur-r" contains the monophthongal vowels /u/. This satisfies the
cernuda's, sandos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cernuda" has the consonants /c/, /r/, /n/, /d/, /u**, and **a** in its spelling, while the word "sandos" has the consonants /s/, /n/, /d**, and **o***. Although they differ in their vowels (/u*/ vs *a* and */o*/), both retain similar sets of consonants (**crndUa** matches with **sndOs**)
can, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "can" has the consonants /k/ and/or/n/, while the word "bruney" also contains those same consonants (/b/r/u/n/e/y). However, their vowels differ; "can" ends with a single vowel sound ("a"), whereas "bruney" features multiple distinct vowel sounds (/"u"/and/"e"/). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
sued, oelkers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sued" has the consonants /sd/, while the word "oelkers" also contains those same consonants (/lksr/) with slightly modified pronunciation due to its German origin, making them phonetically similar in sound (identical). However, their vowels differ: "/u/" for "sued", versus various combinations of vowels ("oe" or "e") in "oelkers". The presence of distinct vowel patterns distinguishes between these two sets of
bonn's, bono's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "b", "n", and "'s" in both "bonn's" and "Bono's" represent the same phoneme (identical sound) as they appear at similar positions within each word, respectively. The only difference lies between their vowels: "o-n-" vs "-on-". Therefore, despite having distinct meanings, these two phrases share common consonants with differing vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
o'shell, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the letters "c" in both "o'clock" (pronounced as /əˈklɒk/) and "canoe" (/keɪnoʊ/) represent similar or identical consonant sounds, which are voiced postalveolar affricate stops ([t͡ʃ]). However, they differ significantly in their corresponding vowels: open-mid back rounded vowel [o] in "o'clock", versus close front unrounded
dover, davey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "v" in both "dover" and "davye" (or more commonly, spelled as "Davey") represent the same /v/ sound, which is a voiceless labiodental fricative consonant phoneme (/ʋ). This means they share the same consonantal quality or feature.However, their vowels differ: "o" in "dover" represents the open-mid back rounded vowel phoneme (/ɔ
sowed, schul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" has the sound /zɔːd/, where "/z/" is the voiced alveolar fricative, which represents the same phoneme as in the word "schul", with the sound /ʃuːl/. Although they differ by their vowels ("o" vs. "u"), both words share the same initial consonantal sound (/s/) followed by distinct vowel sounds (differentiated here). Therefore, we
storti, streett, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "r", "t" in the two words ("storti" and "street") represent identical consonant sounds, which is /tr/. However, their corresponding vowels differ - one has "o" while the other has "e". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (the pair "/tr/") with differing vowel sounds (/ɔː/ vs /i:/). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the words do share identical conson
zel, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zel" has the same consonant sound /z/ as in "lit". However, they differ in their vowel sounds: "el" (in "zel") vs. "i" (in "lit"). The other consonants (/l/, /t/) also match between both words, making them similar but not exactly alike due to this difference in vowels.<|eot_id|>
cally, kiehl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "cally" has the consonants /lly/, while the word "kiehl" also contains the same consonant sound "/ll/", which means they share similar or identical consonant sounds (/l/) despite having distinct vowels in each case ("a", "i"). This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds with varying vowel sounds, hence my affirmative response: YES!<|eot_id|>
seder, petralia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "s", "d", "t" in the word "seder" all represent distinct consonantal phonemes, which remain unchanged when compared to their counterparts in the word "petralia". However, the vowels differ between the two words ("e" vs. no corresponding vowel sound). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds (all three consonants) with differing vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
schuele, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schuel" (pronounced /ʃuːl/) in German, meaning "school", and "Khomeini" (/hɔməiˈni/, the name of Ayatollah Khomeini) both contain similar consonant sound patterns - specifically, the letters "ch" followed by other consonants or silent vowels. However, they differ significantly in their respective vowel sounds ("ue" vs. none). This meets the
sidi, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidi" has the consonants /d/, /i/ (which is actually silent), while the word "kain" also starts with the same consonant sound "/n". Although they differ in their first letter, both end up pronouncing similar consonant sounds (/d/ or /n/) when spoken aloud. Meanwhile, the vowels ("i", "a") vary between them. This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel
keene, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "keen" has the consonant sound /kɛn/ (the combination of the letters K, E, N), while the prefix "chloro-" in chlorofluorocarbons starts with the same consonant sound /klərō/. Although they share similar initial consonants (/K/ vs./KL/, respectively), their subsequent vowels differ: "e" versus no-vowel ("-oro"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two
guyette, gotta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "guyette" has the consonants /y/, /t/, and /t/. The word "got-ta" also contains similar consonant sound combinations: /g/, /t/, and /t/.Although they differ in their vowels (/iː/ vs./ɒ/) and overall meanings, both words share the same sequence of consonantal phonemes (sounds). This is what I mean by saying that they contain identical consonant sounds with differing vowel sounds
zele, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zele" has the consonant sound /z/, while "brion" also starts with the same consonant sound "/b/. Although they differ in their initial vowels ("e" vs. "r"), their starting consonants remain unchanged, making them share identical consonant sounds despite having distinct vowel patterns.<|eot_id|>
egerton, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "g", "r", "t" in both "egerton" and "brun" share similar phonetic values, which means they produce identical or very close sounds when pronounced aloud. This indicates that there are indeed identical consonant sounds between the two words ("egerton"-brun"). The difference lies only in their respective vowels: "e-g-e-r-t-o-n" vs. "-b-r-u-n".<|eot_id|>
lacaze, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lacaze" has the consonants /l/, /c/, and /z/. Meanwhile, the word "ken" also contains the same set of consonants (/k/, /n/) that resemble those in "lacaze". Although they differ slightly due to their respective positions within each word (e.g., /l/ is voiceless while /k/ is voiced), I consider them as having similar or identical consonant sounds for practical purposes. However,
kona, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kona" has the consonants /kn/, which is pronounced as a single sound, whereas in the word "boerner", there's no similar combination of consonants that would match this exact pronunciation pattern. Therefore, I can conclude that they do not share identical consonant sounds despite having distinct meanings. The justification lies in analyzing each individual letter within both words to identify their phonetic representations (sounds) before comparing them for similarity or difference.<|eot_id|>
viau, yves, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "viau" has the consonants /v/, /i/, and /w/. Meanwhile, the word "yves" also contains the same consonants /y/, which is pronounced as /j/ in this context (since Y can sometimes represent a semi-vowel), followed by the vowels "/e/" and "/s". Although they differ slightly due to phonetic variations between languages or accents, both sets of letters (/viaw/) and (/jevs
tyree, touro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tyree" has the same consonants ("t", "r") as the word "tourou". The difference lies in their vowels, with "ee" being present in "tyree" while "o" appears twice in "tourou". Despite this variation in vocalic quality, both sets of letters maintain similar stop-consonantal integrity (the sound produced by pressing down on the tongue to block airflow). This characteristic makes them phonetically equivalent within
boys', baez, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "boys'" ends with the sound /z/, which is also present in the word "baze". The vowels preceding this consonantal ending differ, being 'y' (a semivowel) followed by silent letters ('s') for "boys'", while having distinct letter combinations ("ae") for "baze".Justification: In phonetics, both instances of "bs" represent the voiceless alveolar fricative stop [bz] or its voiced counterpart [
guertin, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "guertin" has the sound /r/, /t/, and /n", while the word "roesner" also contains those same consonants: /r/, /s/, and /nr/. The only difference is in their corresponding vowels, which are /uɛrtɪn/ for "guertin" and /oʊzˈnər/ for "Roesner". Since both sets of consonants (including d
zoll, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zoll" has the consonant sound /ʒ/, which is also present in the word "ozele". However, their vowels differ - "o" in "zoll" versus "e" or possibly "ɛl" (depending on pronunciation) in "ozele". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds with different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
sundai, sandie, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sundae" has the consonants /nd/, /d/, and /y/. Similarly, the word "sandee" also contains the same set of consonants (/n/d/y). However, their vowels differ; "u" in "sundaE" is distinct from the "a" sound in "sandee". Therefore, they meet the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
lacaze, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lacaze" has the consonants 'c' and 'z', while the word "kain" also contains those same consonants, which means they share similar or identical consonant sounds (the sound of /k/, followed by the sound of /s/) despite having distinct vowels ('a' in "lacaze", versus 'i' in "kain"). Therefore, I conclude that yes, both words do indeed possess identical consonant sounds with differing
gomer, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "gomer" and "Rosene" do not share the same vowels, as "o" in "GOMER" is pronounced differently from the combination of letters forming the sound /ɔˈziːn/ (oh-ZEE-n) or possibly even /roʊzəniːn/ (ROH-zuh-neen), which could represent how one might pronounce Rosene depending on regional accents or individual pronunciation preferences.
gomer, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "m" in both words ("gomer-" and "-encase") represent the same sound, which is /m/. Similarly, the letter combination "r" appears at the end of each word and represents the same sound, which is /ɹ/. The only difference between the two words lies in their vowels: "o" vs. "e". Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (the voiced labiodental nasal stop /m/, followed
necaise, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "necase" has the same consonant sound /k/, whereas the word "brune" (or "brown") also shares this exact consonant sound (/b/) followed by two distinct vowels, namely "/r/" and "/u"/ in one case, or "/a/", "/w", and "/n". Therefore, despite having dissimilar meanings, they exhibit similar phonetic characteristics with respect to their consonants while differing substantially regarding their corresponding vocalic
lechler, locally, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lechler" has the consonants /l/, /k/, /r/, /l/, while the word "locally" has the consonants /l/, /s*/, /c**, /l**/. Despite having distinct vowels (/e/ vs. /o*/), they share similar consonant patterns, with all four letters being repeated in both words (L-L-R/L-S-C). This similarity suggests that the two sets of consonants may indeed sound
o'connor, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "o'Connor" has the consonants /k/, /n/, and /r/. The word "jama" also contains those same consonants (/m/ is not present in both, but I'll ignore that for this purpose). Therefore, they share similar or identical consonant sounds: /k/, /n/, and /r/.On the other hand, their vowels differ significantly:* In "O'Connor", there's one stressed syllable with the diphth
streeper, strip, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "streeper" has the consonant sound /r/, while the word "strip" also starts with the same consonant sound /r/. The only difference between them lies in their vowels: "ee" (in "streeper") versus no-vowel ("i", which is often silent, or none at all) in "strip". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (/r/) but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
schul, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schul" has the sound /ʃ/, which is the same as in the word "smol", while their vowels differ: "u" (in "schul") vs. "o" (in "smole"). The correct justification for this conclusion can be found by analyzing phonetically both words:1- In German, when we write 'ch' or 'kh', they represent a voiceless postalveolar fricative (/ʃ/) - like
keen, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "keen" has the sound /kɛn/, where the consonants "/k/" and "/n/" are identical, while the vowels are distinct (/e/) vs. (none). Similarly, in the word "jamb", we see that the consonants "/j/", "/m/', and '/b/' are all unique to their respective positions within each syllable. However, when considering only the initial consonantal clusters of both words ("kj-" for "ke
ashley, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ashley" has the sound /sh/ as its initial consonant, while "germer" also starts with the same sound "/sh". However, their vowels differ - "a" in "ashley" versus "e" or sometimes "er" (depending on pronunciation) in "germer". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (/sh/) but distinct vowel sounds ("a"/("e", "er")). Therefore, I conclude
geac, gokey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the letters "c" in both "geac" and "gokey" represent similar or identical consonantal sound /k/. However, their corresponding vowels differ: "a" (short) in "geac" versus "o" (long) in "gokey". This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between two sets of words.<|eot_id|>
baez, baz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "baez" and "baz" differ only in their vowels, with the first word having an "e" sound (as in "bee") and the second word having no vowel or a neutral vowel sound ("a"). However, they share the same consonantal sequence /b/, /ɑːʒ/. This indicates that despite differing vocalic components, both words exhibit identical consonant sounds (/b/ followed by /z/) while featuring distinct vowel
he, houy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "he" ends with the sound /h/, which is also present in the word "hou-y". However, they differ in their vowel sounds - "e" vs. "-oy", respectively. This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (both end with "/h/") but distinct vowel sounds (/ɛ/ vs./oʊiˈ/). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the words do share this characteristic.<|eot_id|>
sawed, aachener, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sawed" has the consonant sound /d/, while the word "aachen" (the city in Germany) also starts with the same consonant sound /kʃ/. The only difference is that they use distinct vowels: "/ɛ/" for "sawed" versus "/iː/" or "" for "Aachen". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (/d/) but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
schiller, zulu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schiller" has the sound /ʃɪlər/, where "/ʃ/" is a voiceless postalveolar fricative (a sharp hissing sound), "/" represents a short i-sound, and "/l/", "/ə", and "/r/" represent alveolar lateral approximant, central unrounded mid-pause, and voiced alveolar stop respectively.On the other hand, the word "zulu" has the sound /
koehn, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "koen" has the same consonant sound /k/, whereas "Jimmy" also starts with the same consonant sound /j/. However, they differ in their vowel sounds - "oen" is pronounced as [oʊɛn] (with a diphthong) while "i" in Jimmy is a single monophthongic vowel [aɪ]. Therefore, despite having similar starting letters, the two sequences of characters exhibit
tirey, terre, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tire" has the consonants /tr/, /r/, and /y/ (which can sometimes represent the sound of the letter 'j' or not at all), while the word "terrae" has the same set of consonants (/tr/, /r/) with no difference in their pronunciation, differing only by having distinct vowels: "/aɪ/" for "tire" versus "/erə/" for "terrae". The distinction
shula, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shula" starts with the /ʃ/ sound (a voiceless postalveolar fricative) which matches exactly to the start of the second word, "jammer", also starting with the same phoneme (/j/) in this case represented by the letter combination "jm". This indicates they share similar or identical consonant sounds at their beginning. However, since "shua" has distinct vowels ("u") while "jam-er"
keeny, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "keeny" has the consonants /k/, /n/, and /y/. The word "electoral" also contains those same consonants: /l/, /c/, /t**,o**r**al*. Although they differ in their vowels, both words share similar consonantal patterns (the sequence of letters starting with k/n/y or l/c/t/o/r). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two sets of words do contain identical consonant sounds despite
knicks', smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "knicks'" (pronounced as /nɪks/) and "Smollen" (/ˈsmlən/) both contain the same consonantal sound of 'k' followed by 'n', which is represented by the letter combination "/kn/'. However, they differ in their vowels; "knicks'" has the short vowel sound '/i/' whereas "Smollen" contains the long monophthonged vowel sound `/aʊ`
enix, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "enix" has the consonants /n/, /x/. The word "khanna" also has the same consonants, i.e., /k/, /h*/, which is pronounced as a soft /ch*/ in this context (in Hindi language). However, they differ in their vowels: "enix" ends with the sound "/ɪ/" while "khanna" ends with the diphthong "/aʊ/", making them distinct despite having similar
summor's, semis, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "summor" and "semis" do not share the same spelling, so we need to analyze their phonetic values:* "summor" is pronounced as /ˈsʌmər/, with the letter combination "mm" representing the voiced bilabial nasal sound (/m/) followed by the voiceless velar fricative sound (/ŋ/).* On the other hand, "semis" is pronounced as /si
barstow, abreast, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "barstow" has the consonant sound /r/, /s*/, /t*, and /w* whereas the word "abreast" also contains the same consonant sounds, specifically: /b/, /r*/,/*t**, /*est/. The only difference is in their respective vowels (/arstoʊ vs abriːst). This justifies my initial response of 'yes' because they share similar or even exact consonantal phonemes while
altay, alta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the two sets of letters "alt" in both "al-tay" and "alta" share the same consonant sound /lt/, which means they produce similar or identical auditory effects when pronounced together as part of each word's syllable structure. However, their respective vowels ("-tay-" vs "-a-) differ from one another, making them distinct phonetically despite sharing common consonants. This characteristic defines homographs with differing pronunciations (heteronyms
guertin, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "guertin" and "Locatelli" do not share the same vowels, as they differ in their vowel letters ("u", "i" vs. "o"). However, both words contain similar consonant clusters /g/, /r/, /t/, /n/. These consonants appear to be pronounced similarly (alveolar stop for /t/, nasalized labial approximant for /l/, etc.) despite being written differently due to
nex, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response is that the letters "x" in both "nex" and "brei-" represent /ks/, which is an instance of identical consonant sound, whereas the vowels following them differ: "e" (in "nex") vs. "ei" or possibly "ee" (depending on pronunciation) in "brei-". This meets the criteria specified by your question.<|eot_id|>
cede, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cede" has the consonant sound /sɛd/, while "Jimmy" has the consonant sound /ʤəmɪ/. Although they differ in their starting letters, both end with the same consonantal sequence "/m/" which is pronounced similarly (as /m/) despite being written differently (/c/ vs./j/). On the other hand, the vowels preceding those consonants ("e", "i") do not share similar pron
hannam, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hannam" has two consecutive 'n' letters, which indicate the presence of /nː/ sound (a nasalized alveolar stop). Similarly, in the word "caen", we also see double-'c', indicating the existence of another instance of this same phoneme (/kʰ/) or its voiced counterpart /ɡ/. This similarity suggests they share similar consonantal properties despite having distinct vowels ("an" vs. "
scour, screw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "scour" and "screw" share the same consonantal sound /skr/, which includes the letters 'c', 'u' and 'w'. However, they differ in their vowels: "ou" for "scour", and "ew" or "oo" (depending on pronunciation) for "screw". The presence of distinct vowel phonemes distinguishes these two words despite sharing similar consonants.<|eot_id|>
seder, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "seder" has the sound /dər/ (the letter combination "ed" making a distinct sound), whereas the word "bran" has the sound /rɑn/. Although they differ in their vowels (/e/ vs./a/, respectively), both contain the same consonantal phoneme /r/. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words share similar consonant sounds despite having distinctive vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
heisler, houseal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "heiser" has the consonants /s/, /l/, and /r/", whereas the word "houseful" also contains those same consonants: "/h", "/", "", "". The difference lies in their vowels, with "heiser" having the sound of short 'e' (/i/) followed by long 'a', while "houseful" features the diphthong ("au"). Despite sharing similar consonantal patterns, they exhibit distinct vocalic characteristics justifying
hyman, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || YES.The two words "hyman" and "boerner" do not share the same vowels, as they respectively contain the letters 'a' and 'e'. However, their initial consonants ("h", "b") are identical in both words, which justifies my affirmative response. The difference lies solely in the vowel sound that follows each of those consonants.<|eot_id|>
ozelle, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ozelle" has the consonants /z/, /l/, and /lell/ (which can be considered as one sound), while the word "bruneY". The only common consonantal phoneme in both words is /b/. However, their vowel patterns differ: "ozelle" ends with /ɛllei/ whereas "BrunEy" concludes with /uːni/. Since they share no matching consonant clusters or
soady, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "soad" (or rather, the correct spelling is likely meant to be "soda") and "he-man" contain the same consonant sound /d/, which appears in both words. However, their vowels differ - "o-a-d" vs "-e-m". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between them.<|eot_id|>
atek, tek, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "atek" and "tek" differ only in their initial letter ("a-" vs "-"). In both cases, the consonants /t/, /k/ appear with no intervening vowels or other consonants that would change their pronunciation. Therefore, they can be considered to share identical consonant sounds (/tk/) despite having different starting letters. However, since the first word starts with a distinct sound (the voiced phoneme /æ/), while the second does
contusion, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "contusion" has the consonants /nt/, /n/',, and '/s/'. The word "o'Connor" also contains the same consonants: /k', nt/, nd //'. Although they differ in their vowels (/u/' vs./ɒr/), both possess similar consonantal components making them share alike consonant sounds despite having distinct vocalic features. Justification is based on phonetic analysis of individual letters within each term to determine shared consonance.
reisenauer, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "reisenauer" has the consonants /r/, /s*/, and /n*/ whereas the word "brawnY". The consonantal sound of both words matches, i.e., /rn/. However, their vocalic parts differ: in "reisenauer", we find the vowels /eɪ/, while in "BRAWNY," there's only one monophthongal vowel /aʊ/. Since they share similar conson
nex, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nex" has the same consonant sound /ks/, whereas "easily" does not contain this exact combination of letters, so they do share similar consonants in terms of their phonetic value (the actual pronunciation). On the other hand, both words differ significantly with regards to vowels; "nix" ends with a silent 'x' followed by no vowel ("ex"), while "eas-ily" consists entirely of distinct vocalic segments ('ea
zalay, osler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zalay" has the consonants /zl/, which can also appear as /sl/. The same combination of consonants appears in the second part, "-osler", with the letters "s-l". Although they differ slightly due to their positions within each word (the first one is voiced while the latter is voiceless), both instances share similar phonetic properties, making them functionally equivalent for this analysis.On the other hand, the vowels do change between the two
scholl, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "scholl" has the consonants /s/, /h/, and /l/, while the word "zelia" has the same consonants, namely /z/, /e/, and /l/. The only difference is in their vowels: "o" vs. "e". Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds (the triplet "/sh/l") with differing vowel sounds ("o" and "e").<|eot_id|>
tsuda, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tsud" in "Tsuda" has a /tʃ/ sound, while the word "bar" in "Barrineau" also has a /bær/ or /br/ combination of consonants which can be approximated as similar to /t/. Although they differ slightly due to the presence of other phonemes (/d/, /r/) respectively, their overall effect on pronunciation is close enough to consider them having identical consonant
linus, linsay, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "n" in both "linus" and "linsay" represent the same /n/ sound, which is a constant or stop consonantal phoneme (a type of speech sound). This means they share the same consonant quality despite being pronounced differently due to their respective vowels ("u" vs."i"). The difference lies solely with the distinct vowel qualities (/ʊ/ versus /ɪ/) rather than any variation within the conson
luther, aletha, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "th" in both "luther" and "Alethea" represent the same /θ/ sound, which is a voiceless interdental fricative (similar to the 'th' sound in "this"). This means they share similar or identical consonant sounds.However, the vowels differ between the two words: "u" in "Luther" versus "e", "t", and silent "h" in "Ale
sewed, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sewed" has the consonants /s/, /w/, and /d/. Similarly, the word "bran" also contains the same set of consonants (/b/, /r/, and /n). Although they differ in their initial letters (both being vowels), when ignoring the starting letter and focusing on the remaining consonantal sound pattern within each word ("ewed"/"ran"), we can observe that both possess similar phonetic qualities despite having distinct vowel
crowden, cardoni, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "crowden" has the consonant sound /r/, followed by the consonant sound /d/, while in the word "cardoni", we find the same sequence of consonants, namely "/c/", then "/d/', and finally '/n/'. Although their vowels differ ("o" vs. "a"), they share common consecutive consonantal phonemes (/rd/) that match each other exactly. Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed, both words feature identical
pilz, ploys, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "pilz" has a /lz/ sound, which matches with the corresponding part of speech in the second word "ploy"s (the plural form). The only difference between them lies within their vowels: both contain distinct vowel sounds (/ɪlˈz/ vs./oʊˈloiz/, respectively) despite having similar consonants. Therefore, they share identical consonant sounds but differ in their respective vowel pronunciations.<|eot_id|>
sawdey, hehman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "sawday" (or more commonly spelled as "Sweeday") and "heh-man" refer to the same person, specifically Howard Hughes' nickname for his business partner Jean Paul Getty Jr., who was also known as Jimmy Hayes or Heisman.In this case, both words share similar consonantal sound patterns /sw/, /d/, /m/, and /n/. However, they differ in their vowel phonemes: "/eɪ/" versus "/i
schley, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sch" is the same in both "schele-yzill", indicating that they share similar or identical consonant sound(s). However, their vowels differ: "e-le-" (in Schele) vs. "-i-l-". This justifies my affirmative response to your question about whether these two words possess distinct consonant sounds with varying vowel phonemes.<|eot_id|>
ebright, bret, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ebright" has the consonants /b/, /r*/, and *t*, while the word "bret" also contains the same consonants, namely /b/, /r*/*, and */t*. The difference lies in their vowels: "e" vs. no vowel (silent or absent) respectively. This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
guertin, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guertin" has the sound /tɪŋk/ (ting) in its suffix, whereas the word "knack"s has the sound /næk/. Although they differ in their vowels (/uːr/ vs. /æ/, respectively), both possess distinct consonantal qualities ("g", "q"/ or "c", "ch") that set them apart from each other despite sharing similar overall phonetic patterns within specific linguistic contexts
schul, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schul" has the consonant sound /ʃ/, which is also present in the word "annex". However, they differ in their vowel sounds; "schul" ends with the diphthong /uːl/ while "annex" ends with the monophthong /ɛ/. Despite this difference, both words share the same initial consonant sound /skrəŋk/ (or its phonetic transcription
sidi, scholer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidi" has the consonants /s/, /d/, and /i/. In contrast, the word "scholar" starts with the consonants /skh/, which is pronounced similarly to /s/, followed by /löhr/. Although they differ in their initial vowels (/i/ vs./öh/), both sets of consonants share similar phonetic properties (stops/sibilant/lateral approximant). Therefore, I conclude that "
coone, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "coone" has the letter combination /kn/, which represents the same consonant sound as in the word "jemmie", where we also find the letters "/jm/" representing another instance of this particular consonant sound (/k/ or /j/) is not present here). On the other hand, both words differ in their respective vowels ("o" vs. "e"). Therefore, according to our linguistic criteria for identifying similar yet distinct phonetic patterns within language
alleva, oliver, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the word "alleva" ends with the sound /v/, which matches the same consonantal ending as the word "Oliver", also spelled "-ver". However, they differ in their vowels: "alleva" has two consecutive 'A' letters followed by an additional silent letter (double L), while "Olivér" features the long-vowel combination of '-i-' and then '-er'. The difference lies solely within their respective vowel
highman, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "high" and "many" both contain the same consonant sound /h/, followed by distinct vowels "/i/" in "high" and "/a/" in "many". This meets the criteria of having identical consonant sounds (in this case, /h/) with differing vowel sounds (/i/ vs./a/). Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do share identical consonant sounds despite their differences in vowel pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
herminie, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "hermine" has the same consonant sound /r/, /m*/, /n/*, /k*s*/ as in "noakes". The difference lies only in their vowels: "er", "i" (in "hermine") versus "o", "a" (in "noakes"). This meets the criteria for having identical consonant sounds but different vowel sounds.<|eot_id|>
depaolo, deeply, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "depaolo" has the letters 'p', 'l' which make up its consonant sound, whereas in the word "deeply", we find the same consonants ('d', 'e') making similar sounding patterns. However, their vowels differ as one ends with '-o-' (in paolo) while another concludes with '-y'- ending (-ely). This distinction confirms they share matching consonantal qualities despite distinct vocalic differences between them.
strnad, standre, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || YES.The justification is that the letters "str" in both words ("strnad-" and "-stand") represent the same consonantal sound, which is /str/. The vowels preceding this consonant cluster differ: "a" in "strnad-" versus "an" or "" (shortened to "") in "-stand". This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds but distinct vowel sounds between two words.<|eot_id|>
zulu, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zulu" ends with the sound /lʊ/, which has no consonants, just a voiced alveolar lateral approximant (the letter 'u' is pronounced like in "put") followed by a close back rounded vowel (/ʊ/) that's similar to the English pronunciation of "oo".On the other hand, the suffix "-byan" appears at the end of the name "Obryan", where we can identify two distinct parts: "ob
flay, fallaw, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The letters "l" in both the word pair ("flay"-fallow") share similar or identical consonant sounds, which is /ɫ/. However, their vowel sounds differ; "f-l-a-y" has the sound of long A (/eɪ/) whereas "fa-ll-o-w" contains two instances of short vowels (short 'a' followed by silent 'w'). Despite this difference, they do not affect each other's pronunciation due to being
gaetano, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "gaetano" has the consonants /g/, /t/, /n/. The word "rasner" also has similar consonants, namely /r/, /s/, /n/.Although they differ in their initial letters (/g"/ vs "/r"), when we ignore the vowels (the 'a' sound) and focus on the remaining consonantal parts of each syllable ("tno", "srnr"), both pairs share common phonetic
iacono, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "iacono" has the letter combination "-cn-" which represents a /kɛn/ sound, while in the word "brawny", there's also the same sequence of letters representing another instance of this exact phoneme (the voiced velar plosive followed by nasal). The only difference lies within their vowels: "i-a-con-o" versus "r-aw-n-y". This suggests they share similar consonantal patterns despite having distinct
tsuda, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tsu" in the Japanese name "Tsuda" has a /tʃ/ sound, which is a voiceless postalveolar affricate (a type of consonantal sound). On the other hand, the letter combination "zzr" in the Italian surname "Zarroli" also represents this same sound (/tʃ/) when pronounced correctly. Since both possess the same consonant phoneme despite having distinct vowels ("u" vs
rahn, raine, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this is that the letters "n" in both "rahn" and "raine" share the same sound, which is /n/. The vowels preceding them also differ: "a" (in "rahn") vs. "ai" (in "raine"). This satisfies the condition of having identical consonant sounds ("n") with different vowel sounds ("a"/"i").<|eot_id|>
