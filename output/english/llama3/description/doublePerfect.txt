daryl, caryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "dary"l and "cary'l both end with the sound /arl/, which meets the criteria for rhyming, as they share similar vowels ("a") and ending consonantal sounds (/r/l). This is in line with linguistic rules regarding perfect rhymes in English language poetry and music.<|eot_id|>
francesmary, frary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "frances" ends with the sound /s/.2. The second word "marry" also ends with the same sound /r/. However, in phonetics, when two similar but not exactly matching letters appear together (in this case, 'y' being sometimes pronounced like 'i'), we consider them to share the same sound.3. Both words end with -ary which contains the identical vowels (-ar) that follow
wante, constanta, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "wante" ends with the sound /te/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and consonant (t) as the suffix "-ntana". Therefore, according to the rules of rhyming in English poetry, where two words end with different consonants but share similar or identical vowels preceding those consonants, we can conclude that indeed, the words "want-" and "-constant-a" do rhyme.<|eot_id|>
game, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The last syllables of the two words "game" and "next" both end with the same sound /ɛt/. This is because they share the same ending, which includes the vowels "/e/" and the final consonantal cluster "/t". Since their endings match in terms of vowel-consonant combination (different consonants preceded by identical vowel), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to phonological criteria for rhyming.<|eot_id|>
cona, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cona" has the same ending sound as the rest of the phrase, which is "-arsen-" with the same final vowel ("e") and following consonantal sound (the nasalized /n/) in all three parts. This meets the criteria for rhyming. In linguistics terms, this would be referred to as perfect or exact rhymes. Note that some linguistic theories might consider imperfect or near-rhyme if there's slight difference between phonetic
obsolescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two-word pair "obsolescence" and "fluorescence" meet the criteria for rhyming:1. Different consonants: The first word has "-s-" (soft s) while the second word starts with "-f-".2. Identical vowels: Both words end in the sound /əns/.3. Consonant sounds after the shared vowels: Although not exact, both words share similar terminal consonantal sequences (-nce).Considering these
interference, reappearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "interference" and "reappearance" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with "-ence". Although their meanings differ significantly, the final syllables of each word share similar sound patterns (identical vowels and consonants), which is one way to define perfect or exact rhymes in English language poetry and music. Specifically:* Interference ends with /əns/* Reappearance also ends with /əns/The presence of this
pucciarelli, cardarelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "pucciarelli" and "cardarelli" end with the suffix "-elli", which indicates they share similar sound patterns in their final syllables. The vowels preceding this suffix, namely "i" (in "puc-") and "a" (in "car-"), do not change when pronouncing them together ("u" or "e" would also fit). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded by
popularization, aspiration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "popularization" ends with the sound "-ation", which has the same ending sound pattern (-ion) that appears in many English words.2. Similarly, the word "aspiration" also ends with the sound "-tion".3. Both of them end with vowels ("a") before their final consonantal endings ("-n").4. This means they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case,
estimations, radiation's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "estimations" and "radiation"s both end with the suffix "-tion", which means they share similar ending patterns, including vowels ("i") and consonants (the double letter combination of "t"). This similarity in sound makes them rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes. Additionally, no other distinct consonant or diphthong appears before this shared pattern that would differentiate their pronunciation significantly enough to break the rhyme relationship between the two
shelly, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shelly" ends with the sound /iːl/, which consists of a long "e", a voiced alveolar lateral approximant ("ll"), and finally, another voiceless velar stop ("y"). On the other hand, the word "guy-ton" also follows this pattern: it has a diphthong (/aɪ/) consisting of two vowels (long "u" and short "i") before ending in
canney, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "canney" ends with the sound /ē/, which is pronounced as the letter combination "-ey". Similarly, the word "premo" also has this same ending sound "/ō/" (pronounced like "o"). Since they both end in vowels that make similar sounds (/ē/ ≈ /ō/) despite having distinct final consonantal sounds ("nny", "mo"), I conclude that yes, they do indeed rhyme according to standard rhyming criteria involving
herminie, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:1. "hermine" (or actually, I assume you meant to write "Hermenie") ends with the sound /iːnɪ/.2. "rasner" ends with the sound /ərznr/.Both of them end with distinct consonantal sequences (/nd/, /nzr/) followed by identical vowels ("e", no other vowel). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English.However, please note that this is just
rumination, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that both "rumination" and "graduation" end with the same sound /ation/. The vowels in this case ("i" and "a") may differ, but they still produce similar phonetic outcomes when combined with their respective following consonants (/m/, /d/) respectively). This meets one of the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded by identical or very similar vowel and consonant sounds (in this case, the final "/tion/" sound
olokuei's, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the two sets of letters "olokuei" and "germer" do not meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires having:1. Different consonants (not present in this case)2. Identical vowels3. Consonant(s) after those identical vowels (also absent here)In contrast to perfect rhymes like "cat" and "hat", where both pairs share similar ending sounds (/at/) with distinct initial parts ("
ratification, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justifying my response:1. The word "ratification" ends with the sound /-teɪʃən/.2. The word "meditation" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /-deɪʃən/.As you can see, both words end with the combination "-tion", which is where they share their rhyming quality. They meet the criteria for perfect rhymes because they have the same final vowels (/e�
schley, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schley" ends with the sound /iː/ (a long, open 'e' or 'ee') while the word "priam" also ends with this same sound (/piːɑm). Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequence ("sh-" vs. "pr-"), both end with the identical combination of vowels and final consonants (-iy-, -iam), which is one way to define rhyming according to
citation, authentication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "citation" and "authentication" meet the criteria for rhyming:* They both end with the same sound, which in this case is "-ation".* The preceding vowels ("i" and "au") are not exactly alike (they differ slightly), but they do share similar phonetic qualities.* Although there may seem to be slight differences between their ending consonantal sounds (/tɪˈseɪʃən/ vs
legalization, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "legalization" ends with the sound /izayshun/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and final consonant combination (-n) as the word "ablation", which also ends in the sound /eyshan/. Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but sharing the same ending vowels and following consonents (or lack thereof).<|eot_id|>
sighed, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a consonant, preceded by the vowels /iː/ (long 'e' or long 'ee') and no subsequent consonant sounds. On the other hand, the word "Hergert" also has similar ending patterns - /t/. Both of them end in distinct consonantal sounds (/d/ & /t/) but share common identical vowel sounds ('ied'). This meets the
nyx, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "nyx" ends with the sound /ks/, which has no vowels, while the suffix "-smellen" (part of the whole word "smullen") also does not end with any specific vowel-consonant combination but rather a soft -n ending (/mɛnlən/) in English pronunciation. The key to determining if two words rhyme lies mainly on their final phonemes or syllable pairs where they share similar patterns: - In
alamillo, casillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "alamillo" and "casillo" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The last two syllables of each word ("milo" in both cases) share similar phonetic patterns:	+ Identical vowels: Both end with "-i"	+ Consonant sound identity: Both conclude with "/l/"This satisfies the criteria for rhyming words, as they meet the condition that differing consonants precede identical vowel-consonant combinations. Therefore,
popularization, estimation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "popularization" ends with the sound /izn/.2. The word "estimation" also ends with the same sound /izn/.Since both words end with the same vowel-consonant combination, they do indeed rhyme according to linguistic rules for rhyming in English. Rhymes typically require that two or more words share similar final syllable sounds (in this case, -zn). Therefore, I conclude that yes,
peary, seery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "peary" ends with the sound /ēri/, which has the same vowel ("e") and ending consonant (/r/) as the word "seery", also pronounced as /sīri/. The difference lies in their starting consonants, where "p-" appears before "/ēri/" in "peary", while "s-" precedes "/īri/" in "seery". This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different
pucciarelli, passarelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of letters "pucci" and "passa" in both names share similar characteristics:* They end with distinct consonantal sounds (/ri/ for "puci-" and /rəli/" pass-").* The preceding vowels ("u", "i") also match, as they represent the same phonetic sound (the diphthong "/ui"/).Accordingly, considering only the final syllables (-relli) where the rhym
souder, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "souder" ends with the sound /r/.* The word "kanne" also ends with the same sound /n/.Since they both end with different consonantal phonemes (/r/ vs /n/) but share similar vocalic qualities (the long 'a' or open back unrounded vowel), we can conclude that indeed, the two words ("souder" and "kanne") do not perfectly rhyme in terms of their
cheery, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cheery" and "thiery" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they share the same ending sound /ēri/. This is despite having different initial consonants (/ch/ vs. /θ/) since their final syllables (-ry) follow with similar vocalic (the 'e' in both cases) and consonantal patterns.<|eot_id|>
ozelle, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ozelle" ends with the sound /əl/, which has the same vowel (/ɛ/) and following consonant (L) as in the word "kern". The difference lies only in their starting letters, but not in the ending phonemes, making them rhyming words according to the definition of perfect rhyme you provided.<|eot_id|>
sader, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sader" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of a silent letter (the 'd'), then the vowel sound /ɛːr/. The word "jam" also has this same ending, with the vowel sound /æm/.Since both words end with distinct vowels (/ɛ:/ vs./æ/) and no more following consonants, they do not exactly match in terms of their final phonemes. However, considering that English is often len
solder, hehman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "solder" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced as eh-ruh, whereas "hehman" does not seem to exist (I assume you meant "Herman"). If we replace "Hehman" with its correct spelling ("Herman"), then both end with the same vowel-consonant combination (-an). In phonetics, this satisfies the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed share similar
zarroli, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zarroli" ends with the sound /iːlɪ/ (zee-lee), while the word "bran" ends with the sound /ræn/. Although they don't share exact matching letters, their final phonemes (/il/ in both) meet the criteria for rhyming as per English pronunciation rules. Additionally, despite having distinct initial consonantal sounds ("z-" vs. "b-", respectively), this does not dis
shaul, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "shaul" and "hergert" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. The word "shaul" ends with the combination of letters "-ul", which represents the phonetic sequence /ʊl/. On the other hand, the word "hergert" also has multiple syllables (Her-gert), but its final part is pronounced as /tɝrt/, where "/r/" is the preceding conson
kilimanjaro, cafaro, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kilimanjaro" ends with the sound /oʊrɒ/, while the word "cafaro" also ends with the same diphthongal sound (/aʊro/). Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequence, both end with the identical combination of vowels (the long "o", represented as ˈoʊ) and final consonant ("R"). This meets the criteria for rhyming words to
cod, gahm, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cod" and "gahn" (or more accurately, "gam") do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with distinct consonantal sounds: /d/ in "cod", and /n/ or /ŋʰɑːn/ in "gahn".* The vowels preceding those consonants differ as well:	+ In "cod", there's no specific vowel sound (/oʊ/, perhaps), while	+ In
keeney, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "keeney" ends with the sound /iːnɪ/, which has the same vowels ("ee") as well as similar consonantal ending (/ni/) compared to the word "castings", which also ends with the sound /ɪŋz/. Although they differ in their initial letters, this similarity is sufficient for them to be considered rhyming according to linguistic standards of phonetic matching. In linguistics, perfect rhymes require
petralia, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petralia" ends with the sound /ˈpɛtrəliːə/, which has the same ending as the word "zeal", which is pronounced as /ziːl/. Both end in -il, making them rhyming words according to the criteria of having different consonants (P/Z) but sharing the same following vowel-consonant combination (-i). Therefore, they can be considered rhyming.<|eot_id|>
zell, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "zell" ends with the sound /əl/, which consists of two distinct parts: the schwa (/ə/) as the vowel, and the letter "L" (the consonant). Similarly, the word "baran" also has this structure - ending in the combination /n/. Since both combinations share the same vowels but differ in their final consonantal sounds ("L"/"N"), they do not meet the criteria for perfect rhyming according
bacino, victorino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "bacino" (i-no) and "victori(no)" share similar ending patterns, with both having distinct consonantal sounds ("n", "r") preceded by matching vowels ("o"). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry: differing consonants paired with identical vowel-consonant combinations at their ends. Therefore, I conclude that "bacino" and "victori/no" do indeed exhibit rhyming
agglomeration, arbitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The final syllables of both "agglomeration" and "arbitration" end with the same sound /ation/. This indicates that they share similar vowels.* Furthermore, in each word:	+ In "agglomeration", we see -l- (consonant) + o-m-e-r-a-tion	+ In "arbitration", we see -b-i-tr-a-tionAs you can observe
o'shell, petrilla, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "o' shell" ends with the sound /ell/, which has the same ending as the word "petrill-a", where "-a" is pronounced like the letter "ah". The final consonantal sound in both cases is "/l/", while the preceding vowels ("e" in "shell" and "i" in "pitril") follow similar patterns of pronunciation, making them rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes (different consonants followed
o'leary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "o'leary" has the sound /eriy/* The second word "geary" also has the same ending "-ery"* Since they share similar suffixes (-ery) with distinct preceding consonants (/l/ in "oleary", /g/ in "Geary"), we can conclude that they indeed follow the pattern of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, which defines rhyming
gummi, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gummi" ends with the sound /i:/ (long 'i' or 'ee') while "hohman" also ends with the same sound /ɑːmən/. They share the same final vowel-consonant combination, which is one of the criteria for rhyming in English poetry. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to this definition.<|eot_id|>
beary, leery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "beary" ends with the sound /ry/, which is followed by a distinct set of vowels (the letter combination 'ay'). Meanwhile, the word "leery" also ends with the same sound /ry/. Additionally, both words follow this pattern - having different consonants ('b' vs. no-consonant in leery) preceded by the same vowel/consonant sequence ("er"). This meets the criteria for rhyming as per linguistic standards
schaal, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "Schaal" ends with the sound /ɑːl/.2. "Kanne" also ends with the same sound, which is /nə/.Since both words end with the identical vowel-consonant combination of `/ɑːl` or `/-nə`, they do indeed rhyme according to this criteria for rhyming in English (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
confection, reinspection, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "confection" ends with the sound /shn/, which can be broken down into:* Consonants: n, sh* Vowel: o* Final consonant: nOn the other hand, the word "re-inspection" (note that there is no single word "reinspections", so I assume you meant to type "reinspection") also has similar breakdown as follows:* Re- means nothing in this context; let's ignore
stary, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "st" in both words ("stary", "mccary") share the same sound, which counts towards having similar consonant sounds.* The vowels "a" appear at the end of each word with no difference in their pronunciation (i.e., they're pronounced similarly).* Since there's only one distinct pair of letters that differs between the two words - specifically, the first letter being either "s" or "m" - we can
guyton, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guyton" ends with the sound /ɛnɪks/, where "e" is pronounced as in "pet", "i" is silent, and "/ks/" represents two distinct consonantal sounds (k-s). On the other hand, the suffix "-enix" also follows this pattern of having differing consonants (/-n-, -x/) preceded by identically sounded vowels ("e"). Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rh
scary, omary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scary" ends with the sound /ry/, which is composed of two distinct phonemes (/r/ being one, and /y/ being another). On the other hand, the suffix "-mary" also has a double phoneme structure, where "/m/" represents a single consonantal phoneme and "/ar/" constitutes another pair (the second part consisting of vowels "/a/" and consonental "/r/", but still considered as a unit).The crucial
connor, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "connor" ends with the sound /r/* The word "bawny" (not "brawny", please note that) also ends with the same sound /nɔːri/As per your request, I analyzed whether they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and ending in similar or identical sounds (/r/) and both being pronounced similarly at the end. Since
millers, killers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "millers" ends with the sound /rzərz/, while the word "killers" also ends with the same sound /lzərs/. Since they share the same ending vowels (/er/) and similar but not exactly matching final consonantal sounds (both end in -l-s, which can be considered as having identical or very close phonetic values), we conclude that "millers" and "killers" do indeed rhyme according to linguistic standards
unofficial, initial, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "unofficial" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant.* The next part "-ficial", also has the same ending, namely "/l/", which means that this section of both words share the same final consonant and vowel combination (the double 'L' at the end).* Therefore, according to the definition provided in your question ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds"), we can conclude that "
talty, faulty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "talty" ends with the sound /ti/* "faulty" also ends with the same sound /ti/Both words end with the letter combination "-ly", which indicates that they share the same ending phonemes, specifically the vowels "/i/" and the following consonantal cluster "/l+y". This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry and linguistics: having the same final syllable's vowel quality (in this case,
alcoa's, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word phrase "alcoa's" and "Geiger" (note the correct spelling of Geithner) can be analyzed as follows:* In both words, we find distinct consonantal clusters:	+ For "alcoa's", there is no specific consonant cluster mentioned; however, considering's' at the end makes up for any potential confusion.	+ For "Geither", we see the combination of letters "G-e-i".
sorrenti, venti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sorrenti" and "venti" both end with the "-enti" suffix, which means they share similar vowel and consonant sounds at their ends (the same vowels /eɪ/, and the consonant cluster "/nt/" or "/ndt"). This is one of the key characteristics that defines rhyming in English language poetry. Additionally, despite having slightly differing starting letters ("S-" vs "V-", respectively), this shared ending sound makes
koehn, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**The reason is that the last syllables of both "koen" (pronounced as /kɛn/) and "prom" end with distinct vowels (/eʊ/) but share similar preceding consonantal sound patterns, which satisfies the criteria for rhyming in English.In more detail:* Both "koen" and "rom" contain the same final vowel phoneme /oʊ/, also known as diphthongized [ə] or schwa
subordination, cremation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "subordination" ends with the sound /nətʃɪˈneɪʃn/.	+ It has the following sequence of phonemes: -ntch-I-n* The word "cremation" also ends with the same sound /teɪʒən/.     + It has the following sequence of phonemes: -tn-tsh-E-yen (Note that although there's
recalculation, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "recalculation" and "graduation" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming:* They both end with the same sound: -ation* The vowels preceding this ending (-cal-, -adu-) differ, but not in their quality (e.g., /ɪ/ vs. /aʊ/)* The following consonants (/l/, /t/) also differ, which means they don't share any identical phonemes.
stimulation, dissemination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Stimulation: stim-u-la-tion2. Dissemination: dis-sem-i-na-tionBoth words end with the same sound "-tion", which makes them rhyming words. The initial consonantal sounds "stim-" and "dis-", respectively, do not affect their ability to rhyme since they come before the shared vowels and final consonantal sounds ("-u-lation" vs. "-sem-ination"). Therefore, based on this
sterilizations, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sterilizations" ends with the sound /zən/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" (not pronounced) and "/a/", followed by the consonantal ending "/nz/. On the other hand, the word "lookers" also has this same pattern, where it is ended by the diphthongal sound /ʊkɚs/, consisting of the vowels "/u/" and "/o", accompanied by the final consonantal
lookers, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "looker" ends with the sound /r/.* The suffix "-sne-" in "rose-ne" can be broken down into two parts: "/sn/" (the consonantal part) and "-e" (the vocalic part).* Since both "looker"s and -"/sn/" end with the same sequence of phonemes (/r/, which corresponds to the identity of vowels), they meet the criteria for rhyming
meryll, beryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "merry" and "berry" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (-ryl) which is composed of the letter combination "-er-" (different consonants), plus the repeated vowels ("y") that follow them. This shared phonetic pattern satisfies the definition of rhyming in English language poetry and music.<|eot_id|>
koehn, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "koen" in "Koehn" has the same sound as the syllable "-reign-" or "brei-" in "Breighner". The final consonantal /n/ of Koehn matches with the ending -r-/-gh-r of Breighner, which makes them rhyming according to phonetic rules. This means they share similar sounds for both vowels (-e-) and following consonants (both 'n
florance, torrance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "florance" and "torrance" both end with the "-ence" sound, which is considered a rhyming ending in English language poetry and music. Additionally, they share similar phonetic patterns, where the final consonantal sounds /nʃ/ (in "flor-") match exactly to those of "/rəns/" (in "torn-"), as well as having distinct but matching vowel sounds (/ɔː/)
o'leary, sneary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "o'Leary" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" (the single quote indicates a silent 'e') and the consonant(s) "/r". The word "sneary", on the other hand, also ends with the same combination: the vowels "/ea/" (again, note the double quotes indicating no emphasis or stress), plus the consonant(s) "/ry".As both end-sequences share
murjani, trani, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "murjani" and "trani" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they share similar ending phonemes (/i/) which is considered to be their final vowels in combination with any following consonantal sound(s). This similarity of vowel-consonant combinations at the end makes them technically rhyme according to linguistic standards.<|eot_id|>
schueler, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "schuler" ends with the sound /ər/, which has the same vowel (/ɛ/) and final consonant (R) sound.* The word "germ" also ends with the sound /ərm/, which again has the same vowel (/ɝ/) and final consonant combination (-RM).Since both words end with similar vowel-consonant combinations, they technically rhyme according to linguistic definitions of rhyming in English
scary, canary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last two syllables of "scary" (ry) end with the same sound as the first three letters ("can-a-") in "canary". The vowels (-y, -a-) also match exactly. This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "scary" and "canary" do rhyme!<|eot_id|>
zaley, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "zalei" in "Zaley" has the sound /ei/, which matches with the same sound /en/ in "smulen", making them rhyming words according to the criteria of having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and ending with similar consonantal sounds (/l/) in both cases.<|eot_id|>
soeder, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "soeder" ends with "-er", which has a distinct sound, while the word "easel" also ends with "-el". The final vowels ("-r") in both words differ from each other, but they share similar preceding consonantal sounds (/s/, /z/) before those vowels. Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that "soeder"
shelly, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "shelly" and "breon" both end with the sound "-ly". This is considered to be a rhyming pattern, as they share similar phonetic characteristics at their ending points. Specifically:* Both words contain the same vowels ("e") in that position.* They also feature distinct but matching consonantal sounds (the final letters "l-y").According to this definition of rhything criteria, we can conclude that indeed, "shelly
zelia, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "zelia" ends with "-lia", which has the same vowels ("i") and distinct consonants ("-l"). The word "baran" also ends with "-ran", which again features the same vowel ("a") but unique consonants ("-r").In both cases, we can identify matching vowel phonemes (the letters "i" in " zel ia" and "a" in "bara n"), accompanied by distinctive consonantal endings (-li-
nex, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nex" ends with the sound /ks/, which is made up of two distinct consonants, while the suffix "-reaser" has a silent final letter 'r' that doesn't affect its pronunciation. When we ignore this silent 'r', both parts end with the same vowel-consonant combination (-ex). Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming (different initial consonants + similar ending vowels & consonants), I conclude that indeed they
suder, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "suder" ends with the sound /r/, which is not present in the last two letters of the word "en-case". The second-to-last letter, or the preceding consonant, in both cases is also distinct: 'd' for "suder", and 'c' for "en-case".To determine if they truly rhyme, we should look at their ending vowels as well (if there's more than one syllable). In this case
prevented, consented, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "prevented" ends with the sound /nted/, which has the same vowels (e) as well as similar consonantal ending (/t/) compared to the word "consented", which also ends with the sound /nted/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share the same final phonemes in terms of both their vowel and consonant patterns. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "prevented" and "
tsuda, schley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tsuda" ends with the sound /duːdə/, which has the same ending as the word "schley", which also ends in /li/. The vowels (/u:/) are not exactly identical, but they share similar qualities (front unrounded close-mid rounded), making them functionally equivalent for rhyming purposes. Additionally, both endings feature distinct consonantal sequences: "/t+s+ɯ/" vs "./ʃ+l
replication, rejuvenation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "replication" and "rejuvenation" do indeed share the same ending sound /-ate/. This is because they both end with the suffix "-tion", which has the effect of making their final syllables rhyming in terms of vowel-consonant combination (V-C). Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhymes, we can conclude that "replication" and "rejuvenation" technically rhyme. However, please note that this
clarence, terence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "clarence" and "Terrence" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The ending sound of both words is "-ance", which indicates that they share similar phonetic characteristics.2. In linguistics terms, this means that both words end with a diphthong (a combination of two vowels) /erəns/, where "/r/" represents the same voiceless alveolar trill stop in each word.3. Furthermore, the preceding consonantal
abhorrence, lorance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "abhorrence" ends with the sound /ns/, which consists of two distinct consonants (n-s) following a single, identical vowel (/o/) and another consonant (/rce). The suffix "-lorance", on the other hand, also has this structure: three consecutive letters ("l-o-r") form one unit representing a unique combination of vowels and consonants.Given their similar ending patterns (-nce in both cases), they can indeed be
saudi, gitano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**, the words "saudi" and "gitano" do not exactly rhyme.Here's why:* The last syllable of both words has distinct consonantal endings: "-di" in "saudi", which consists only of one letter ("d"), versus "-no" in "gitano".	+ In rhyming, we typically look for matching ending patterns with multiple letters (consonance) or similar phonetic sequences.	+ Since they don't share this characteristic
laurence, torrance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "laurence" ends with the sound /ns/, which is a combination of two distinct consonants (n and s). On the other hand, the word "torrance" also ends with the same combination of consonants (/ncs/) that produce similar phonetic effects when spoken aloud. This satisfies one criterion for rhyming - having different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds in their final syllables. Therefore, I conclude that "La
replication, amalgamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "replication" and "amalgamation" do indeed share the same ending sound /ation/, which consists of the vowels 'i' and 'a', respectively, along with similar consonantal endings (-tion). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming in English poetry, where phonetic similarity is often used to create musicality or clever wordplay.<|eot_id|>
schuller, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuller" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced like "ur". Meanwhile, the word "health" also has this same ending sound "/t/" (which can sometimes blend into a soft pronunciation of "/l/", but in general, it's still considered to end with "/t"). As they both share similar final vowels ("u") and consonant sounds ("/t"/ or "/l"/), we consider them rhyming pairs according
invalidation, confederation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "invalidation" ends with the sound /-tion/.* The word "confederation" also ends with the same sound /-tion/.Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination, which includes the identical vowels (/i/) and consonants (/t/, /n*/), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to linguistic criteria for rhyming words in English language poetry or music.<|eot_id|>
heeling, teeling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "heiling" and "teeling" meet the criteria for rhyming because they both end with the "-eing" sound, which is considered to be their final syllable's phonetic value (identical vowels and consonants). In linguistics, this type of ending is known as a perfect or exact rhyme. This means that not only do the two words share similar letters in sequence but also convey equivalent pronunciation when spoken out loud. Therefore, I conclude
conn, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "conn" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, while the suffix "-castings" has the same ending as well, namely "/sɪŋz/" (the plural form of "-casting"), which also includes two consonants (/ng/) followed by a single vowel sound ("i") and another consonantal group ("/z"). Therefore, they do meet the criteria for rhyming in English: having different consonants preceded
multiprocessor, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "multiprocessor" and "khanna" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "multiprocessor" ends with the sound /r/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.* On the other hand, the name "Khanna" typically has its own unique pronunciation in various languages (e.g., Punjabi or Hindi), but if we assume a common English approximation as /ˈkænə/, it would end with the diphthong
aside, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "aside" ends with the sound /ide/, which has the vowels "i" and "e", both of them being pronounced as distinct phonemes in English (the first one is often silent). The word "healthy" also ends with the diphthongal sound "/ēli/" or simply "/li/", where the second part ("l") represents a separate consonantal segment.In this case, we can observe that:1. Different consonants: Both words end
koehne, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word phrase "koehne" and "breignher" can be broken down into their individual phonetic components:* Koehne: /kɔˈni/	+ k (consonant) + o (vowel) + e (identical vowel sound)	+ n (different consonant after the vowels)* Breighner: /briˈnər	+ b (consonant) +
chery, unwary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cherry" and "unawarely" (not exactly "unwary", but I assume that's what you meant) do not rhyme.Justification: The word "cherry" ends with the sound /ry/, which is made up of distinct consonants ("r") and vowels ("e"). On the other hand, the suffix "-ware-" in "unawarely" has its own unique set of consonantal and vocalic components (/wɛr
o'conner, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "o'Connor" ends with the sound /ɑnər/, which consists of:* The letter combination "on", representing the same consonantal sound (/n/)* The vowel sound "/a/" (the 'ah' in father)On the other hand, the word "Orson" also ends with the sound /sɔnsən/, consisting of:* The letters "sn", representing two distinct consonantal sounds* No
olokuei's, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The two sets of letters "oloku" in the first word, and "earn" in the second word, both end with distinct consonantal sound.2. In each case, this unique combination ends with a single vocalic (vowel) sound: "-u-" for "olkouei", and "-a-" for "earn".3. This fulfills one condition to determine if two words can potentially rhyme - having similar final syll
circumventing, tenting, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "circumventing" and "tenting" do indeed share the same ending sound /-ting/, which is formed from a combination of the vowels "-i-" (identical) and the final consonantal sequence "/nt/" (different). This meets the criteria for rhyming, as both words follow this pattern of having different initial consonants but sharing similar vowel-consonant endings. Therefore, I conclude that they can be considered to rhyme.<|eot_id|>
cleary, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "cleary" and "biery" meet the criteria for rhyming:1. They both end with distinct consonant sound(s) ("ry").2. The preceding vowels in each word match, being /eɪ/ (long 'a' or 'ay') in both cases.3. Although their meanings differ, they share similar phonetic patterns at the ending (-ly), which makes them rhyme according to linguistic standards of perfect rhymes
flicker, snicker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "flicker" and "snicker" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the sound /ər/, which is composed of:	+ The letter combination "-ck-" (different consonants)	+ The vowel sound "/ɛ/" (identical in both cases)Since they share this characteristic (-ck- + /ɛ/) at their ending points, we can conclude that "flicker" and "snicker" exhibit rh
prima, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the ending vowels "a" in "prima" and "elcot-" (which doesn't exist, I assume you meant to type "telco") don't match exactly.In rhyming words, the final consonantal sound(s) and following vowel phoneme should be identical or very similar for them to technically rhyme. In this case:* The word "prima" ends with /ma/* There's no existing English word "elcot
russification, pronunciation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justifying my answer:* The word "russification" ends with the sound /fɪˈkeɪʃən/.* The word "pronunciation" ends with the sound /njʊsɪˈeɪʃn/.Although they do not share exact letters, their final syllables exhibit similar phonetic characteristics:	+ Both end in -ation (-š- vs -jn-) which indicates that both follow the same pattern of
schueler, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the final syllables "-eler" in "schüler" (a German word) and "eas-ily" do not share identical vowels, which is one of the key characteristics required for rhyming.In linguistics, perfect rhymes require matching phonemes at corresponding positions within two or more words. In this case:* The last three letters (-ler) in both words differ: "r", "l", "r" vs. no similar
o'shell, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o' shell" has the sound /ɔʃəl/, where "/ɔ/" is the diphthong representing two distinct vowels, not just one. Similarly, in the word "Keene", we can break down its pronunciation as /kiːn/. Both words end with the same phoneme sequence "-el". This satisfies the condition for rhyming, which requires that they share similar ending patterns (consonant-vowel
leake, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "leake" and "smullen" do rhyme.Justification:The word "leake" ends with the sound /ke/, which is made up of two parts: the vowel sound "/e/" (which remains constant) and the consonantal sound "/k/".Similarly, the word "smullen" also ends with the same combination of phonemes - the vowel sound "/u/", followed by the consonantal sound "/ln"/ or more specifically, the cluster "/
adelanto, delsanto, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "adelanto" ends with the sound /toh/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: /tʰo/. The second syllable, "delsanto", also has a similar ending "/toh/", comprising again two separate phoneme combinations: /sɑnto/.Since both endings share this same pattern (different consonants + identical vowels), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry or music. This
leery, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "leery" and "dreary" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The ending sound of both words is "-ry", which indicates that they share similar phonetic characteristics.2. In terms of rhyming criteria, we look for differences in initial consonantal sounds (in this case, /l/ vs. /d/) but identical vowel-consonant combinations (-ey). Since "/r/" follows each vowel in both cases ("e-y"), they meet
schuele, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare the final syllables of each word. In this case, "schuele" and "herronimo".The last three letters in "schuele" are "-ule", which contain the same vowels ("u") but differ in their consonantal sound (the first letter is "L" whereas there's no equivalent consonant in "Herronimo").On the other hand, "Herronimo
passions, manasion's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two syllables of "passions" ("sion"s) share similar sounds with those in "manaison'". The 'i' sound in both cases can be considered as having identical vowel and consonant sounds, despite being slightly pronounced differently due to their context within each word. Additionally, there aren't any distinct differences between the preceding consonantal sounds ('ss', 'n') which further supports this conclusion. Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rh
souder, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "souder" ends with the sound /r/2. "kian" also ends with the same sound /n/Although they do not exactly share their final letters (one has 'R' while another has 'N'), in phonetics, when considering rhyming criteria for English language, we consider the preceding syllable's ending to match, which includes both vowels and following consonants or no-consonants (vowel combinations).
litigating, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "litigating" ends with the sound /ting/, which has the same vowel (i) and final consonent (/g/) as the suffix "-ing".* The word "jammer" also ends with the sound /r/.* Since both ending sounds ("-ging"/"-er") meet the criteria of having distinct initial consonants, but share the same vowels and terminal consonents, they can be considered rhyming according to
hamner, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "hamner" and "nyx" do not perfectly match in terms of their ending syllables, but they can still be considered as rhyming to some extent due to the similarity between their final vowels ("er" vs."ix"). However, if we strictly adhere to the definition that requires identical vowel-consonant combinations at the end (e.g., -ar-r), then I would argue that this is more of an approximate or near-perfect rhyme
schuele, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuel" has the sound /ʃuːl/, which consists of the letter combination "shue". This is compared to the name "Jimmy", where the final syllable "-y" can be broken down into its individual phonemes as /jɪm/. Since both sequences end with distinct vowels (/u:/ vs. /i/) and no shared consonantal sounds, they technically do not share rhyming characteristics according to linguistic criteria
severino, tomatino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "severino" and "tomatino" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with "-ino", which means that they share the same ending sound (the combination of vowels and consonants). This is despite having some differences in their initial letters ("s-" vs. "t-") and preceding syllables. In linguistics, this type of matching between two or more words based on similar sounds at the ends is known as perfect
cedar, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cedar" ends with the sound /r/, which is not present in the suffix "-eo" of "borneo". Therefore, they do not share similar final consonant-vowel-consonant patterns (CVC) that define rhyming pairs. However, both words end with vowels ("-a" for "cedar", "-"oe" for "bornéo"), making them partially match on this criterion. Nonetheless, I conclude that "cedar
scary, unwary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "scary" ends with the sound /ry/.* The second word "unwary" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely "/n/" (consonant) + "a"r(y)" (/ar/) which can be considered equivalent to having identical vowel and consonant sounds.* Therefore, based on this criterion, we conclude that the two words do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
hergert, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "hergert" and "bran" do not share the same ending sound, which is one of the key characteristics of rhyming words in English poetry. In order to qualify as rhymes, they would need to end with similar or identical vowels (in this case, both ends contain distinct letters) and/or consonantal combinations that produce matching phonetic effects when spoken aloud. Since their endings differ significantly ("-rt-" vs "-n"), we
healthy, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "healthy" ends with the sound /ly/, which is formed by the letters L-Y, where both 'L' and 'Y' share similar characteristics (consonantal). Similarly, in the word "branner", we can identify that -ER at the end forms a distinct phonetic unit (/rən/) having same vowels (-E) following consecutive consonants ('R', 'N'). Hence, they exhibit rhyming properties according to linguistic standards
sidey, szalay, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sidey" and "szalay" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sounds ("dy" in "sidey", and "lay" or "zy" in "szalay") followed by identical vowel sounds (/iː/) in each word. This similarity between their ending phonemes makes them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
khomeini, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "khomeini" and "Kissingly/Kissling" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "khomeini" ends with "-i", which is pronounced as /ɪ/.* In contrast, both "Kissingly" (pronounced as /ˈsɪzəŋli/) and "Kissling" end with either "/l/" or "/ng/", but neither has the exact same sound combination.	+
sewed, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sewed" ends with the sound /d/, which is not present in the second part of the comparison, "-zel-" or "-ele". However, both parts end with the same vowels "/e/" and "/el/", respectively. This meets one condition for rhyming, namely having similar terminal phonemes (vowel-consonant combinations). Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed share some degree of similarity in their ending sounds, making them somewhat rh
chalet, petrelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: To determine if "chalet" and "petrel-li" (assuming that's the correct spelling) rhyme, we need to analyze their ending sound patterns.* The last two letters of "chalet" are "-et", which contain distinct consonant sounds /t/.* In contrast, the suffix "-li" in "petrell-i" has no additional consonant following its single vowel sound (/ɪ/) before the silent letter combination ("ll").Although both
heman, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "heman" and "rosin" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "heman" ends with the sound /man/, which has the vowels /e/ and/or silent letters (/m/) following distinct consonantal sounds.On the other hand, the word "rosin" ends with the sound /zin/, having no shared similar vowel-consonant combination between them. The differing final syllables (/-an/ vs./ -zin/) prevent them from
camilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "camila" ends with the sound /aɪlə/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) followed by distinct consonantal sounds (/m/ and /l/)* Similarly, the word "costilla" also ends with the sound /sɪˈtɪleh/, which again features the same vowel sound (/i/) preceded by unique consonatal sequences (/kstil/)* Since both pairs of
saudi, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /di/, which is pronounced as a diphthong (a combination of two vowels). This sound consists of the vowel sounds "/u/" and "/i/", both preceding the same consonantal ending "/d/. On the other hand, the word "heman" also has the final syllable "-man", where the last letter "n" precedes another silent or voiceless alveolar nasal stop "/m/.
sidi, shelor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sidi" and "sheler" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "sidi" ends with the sound /iːdi/, which has distinct vowels (/i/) and consonants (d).* On the other hand, the word "sheler" ends with the sound /ʃɛlər/, which also contains distinct vowels (/e/) and consonants (l-r).Although both words end in -er suffixes
gumm, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gum" has the sound /mʊm/, where "/u/" is the identical vowel sound, and "/m/" is the same consonant sound as in "roast". Similarly, "rosten" can be broken down into two parts - "ros-" having the sound /rɒs-, and "-ten" with the sound /tən/. Although not exact matches, they share similar phonetic patterns that could lead to rh
bourne, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bourne" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, followed by the diphthong "our", where both vowels ("o" and "u") make distinct phonetic changes when pronounced together (a gliding transition from one to another). On the other hand, the name "Jimi" also has two parts - "ji-" ending in a stop consonantal sound (/t/) and "-mi" following that same vowel-conson
schlee, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schlee" and "kain" can be analyzed as follows:* In the word "schlee", we see that the final sequence of phonemes is /iː/. This consists of two parts:	+ A single, identical vowel sound (/ɪ/) represented by the letter combination 'ee'.	+ No following consonant.* Similarly, in the word "kain", we find that its last part has no distinct consonantal ending
mary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "mary" ends with the sound /ry/, which consists of two distinct letters ("r" and "y") following one vowel letter ("a"). The word "derry", on the other hand, also ends with the same combination of phonemes: /rr/. In both cases, we see similar consonantal sequences (RR) preceded by a single vowel (/i/) in each case. This meets the criteria for rhyming as described above.<|eot_id|>
romances, advances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The last syllables of the two words "romances" and "advances" both end with "-ces".	+ In "romances", the final sequence is /sɛz/, where "/s/" represents the same voiceless alveolar fricative sound, and "ez" represent the identical vowel-consonant combination.	+ Similarly, in "advances", the final sequence is also /sɛz/.*
nonessential, providential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "nonessential" and "providential" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. The last three letters of each word ("nal", "-tional") share similar phonetic characteristics:1. Both end with the sound /nəl/, which is pronounced as "nell".2. They both contain vowels (o) that follow the same pattern.3. Although they differ in initial consonantal sounds (/n/) vs./p
zil, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "zil" ends with the sound /l/, which matches with the ending of the second part, "-obry-" (where the last two letters form the digraph "/r/" or single letter "R"), as both share similar vowel-consonant combinations (/i-l/ vs./o-byr-). The rhyming criteria you mentioned ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds") holds true in this case: although there
sudd, szalay, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sudd" ends with the sound /d/, which is then followed by the same vowels "/u/" as in the word "szul", not "sal". Therefore, they do meet the criteria of having different consonants (/d/ vs none) followed by identical vowel ("u") and consonant (none). The correct comparison should be made between "sud-" and "-lay".Justification:In English rhyming rules, two words can only be considered
shirlee, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shirlee" ends with the sound /iːli/, which has the same vowel sound (/ee/) as well as similar consonantal endings (-le) compared to the word "zeal", which also ends with the diphthong "/ziəl/", having the same vowel sound (/eɪ/) but not exactly matching in terms of final consonants (/-el vs -l). However, since both words share the same ending
souder, keeny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "souder" ends with the sound /r/.2. The second word "keen-y" also has two parts: "-een-" (identical vowels) and "-y" (different consonant).Since they both end in similar sounding patterns, specifically having identical vowel sounds ("ee") and one ending differently (/r vs -y), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to phonological criteria for rhyming
devaluations, inaugurations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "devaluations", ends with the sound /tɪzən/	+ It has two distinct consonants: 'l' (voiceless alveolar lateral approximant) and's'	+ The final vowels are both pronounced similarly (/iː/) in this context* The second word, "inaugurations", also ends with the sound /teɪʃənz/
schlee, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of syllables "schlee" and "-chlorofluoro-car-bons" both end with the same sound /ee/. This is considered as having identical vowel and consonant sounds, which makes them rhyming in this context. Additionally, there's no difference between their following consonants (none or all), so they meet the criteria for perfect rhyme according to phonetics rules.<|eot_id|>
uhlich, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "uhlich" and "chlorofluorocarbons" do not perfectly match in terms of rhyming, but they share similar ending sounds /ihlɪtʃ/ and /kərəfliˈkjʊəroʊbærz/, respectively. While the vowels preceding the shared sound differ (u vs k), the final consonantal sequence (-ich) is preserved across both words. This similarity
stary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "starry" ends with the sound /ry/, which has the same vowel ("y") as well as the consonant (/r/) in the second syllable of the word "contrary". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming words having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
gahm, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gahm" ends with the sound /ɑːm/, which is pronounced as "arm". Similarly, the word "health" also ends with the same phoneme sequence of /lʰeɪθ/. Both end in the long 'a' (ɑ) sound, making them rhyming words according to their shared final syllable's pronunciation pattern.<|eot_id|>
drusilla, cancilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "drusilla" ends with the sound /əl/ (the letter combination "-ill-a"), while the word "cancilla" also ends with the same sound /əl/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, which requires having different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds (/dru-ˈsɪlə/ vs. /kæn-ˈsɪlə/, where "/ə
highman, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "highman" and "litigating" do not perfectly rhyme, but they share similar ending sounds (-an in both). However, the vowels preceding those -ans differ (i/i vs e/e), which is one of the criteria for rhyming. Nevertheless, some linguists might consider them to have a near-rhyme or imperfect rhyme due to their shared sound pattern at the end. I'm inclined to say yes because while there's no exact
cedar, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cedar" ends with the sound /r/ (a consonant) followed by the diphthong "ea" (identical vowels). Meanwhile, the word "annex" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes - /x/ (consonant) + "eɪks" (differing in quality but not quantity).In both cases:1. Consonants differ:	* Cedar's final consonant is
visitations, collaborations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "visitations" ends with the sound /tɪʃənˈzeɪʃnz/, which has the same vowels ("i", "a") but different consonants (/s, z/) compared to the ending of the second word "collaborations".	+ In "visitation"s: t-i-sh- (identical vowel/consonant pattern)	+ In "col-lab-or-a-t
graduation, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Here's why:1. The first word is "graduation", which ends with the sound /ation/.2. The second word is "panelization", which also ends with the same sound /ation/.As you mentioned, rhyming requires having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (VCC pattern). In this case,* Both words end with the VCC sound "/-tion".* They share similar vowels ("a" in both cases).*
saudi, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "saudi" and "sterilizations" do not perfectly rhyme in the classical sense, as they don't share exactly the same ending sound (e.g., -di vs. -liz). However, when we examine their phonetic structure more closely:* "Saud-i-" ends with /iː/* "-ter-il-i-z-a-tions" also ends with /ɪz/Although there's no exact match between the final
benedetti, magneti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beneditti" and "magnetii" (assuming you meant to write "magenti") do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share the same ending sound that includes both vowels and consonants. In this case, while the last syllables of each word (-iti in "beneditti" and -eti or "-ati" depending on how one pronounces "magnet-i", which is more likely
transformations, syndications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of words "transformations" and "syndications" meet the criteria for rhyming:1. They both end with different consonants: -tions (in 'transformations') vs. -cations (in'syndications').2. The vowels preceding those consonants sound alike, being /iːʌn/. In phonetics notation, this would represent [ɪ] or long close front unrounded vowel in
annexation, creation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "annexation" ends with the sound /tion/, which has a distinct sequence of consonants (n, x) followed by vowels (i, o). Similarly, the word "creation" also ends with the same sound pattern (/tion/) having unique sequences of consonants (r, c) followed by identical vowels (o).Since both words share this specific phonetic ending (-tion), they can be considered as rhyming or exhibiting end-r
mcnary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "mcnary" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: /r/ (a voiceless alveolar trill) and /i/ (the long, close front unrounded vowel). The word "dery", on the other hand, also ends with the same combination of phonemes (/r/) and (/i/).In linguistics, rhyming requires not only matching vowels but also similar or identical
weary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "weary" and "geary" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. Both words end with the "-ry" suffix.2. The vowels preceding this suffix in both words ("e" and "g") form pairs that share similar phonetic values (i.e., /ɛːrʌ/) when pronounced together with their respective following consonantal elements (/ri/, /raɪ/). This similarity is crucial for determining rhyming relationships between
shula, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "shula" and "nix" (not exactly the word provided, but I assume you meant that) do not perfectly match in terms of rhyming as they don't share the same ending sound or phoneme sequence. However, if we consider only the vowels ("u", "e") at their ends, which is one way to define perfect rhymes according to linguistic rules on syllable division and phonological similarity, then yes, both end with
ornamentation, liberation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* In the word "ornamentation", the last three letters ("ntion") form a rhyming sound.* Similarly, in the word "liberation",the last four letters("tion") also form a rhyming sound.* Since both ending parts of each word contain the same vowels ("i"), they can be considered to share similar phonetic properties (different consonants + identical vowel/consonant combinations).Therefore, based on this
schuler, keeny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" ends with the sound /er/, which is a combination of a vowel (/e/) and two consonants (the final letters "/r"). Similarly, the word "keen-y" also has this same pattern - ending in /y/. Since they both share the same sequence of vowels and consonants at their end ("ee"), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the phonological criteria you mentioned.<|eot_id|>
arseneau, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "arseneau" ends with the sound /oʊ/, which has a distinct vowel sound.* The suffix "-jammer" also ends with the same sound /rəmɛ(ː)r/. Although there's some variation in pronunciation, both end with roughly similar consonantal sounds (/r/) following that identical vowel sound (/eɪ) or its variant (in this case, /oʊ/.Given their
lack, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "lack" ends with the sound /k/, which is not present in the word "germ", but both end with the same vowel sound (/æ/) and no other following consonant, making them rhyming words according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
impairing, chairing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "impair" ends with the sound /ɪŋ/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" (short "i") and the nasalized ng-consonant pair "/nʰg/", whereas the suffix "-chair-" in "chairing" also has the same ending, namely "/aɾɪŋ/", consisting again of the short-vowel "/a/" followed by the voiced alveolar stop consonant "/r/"
luk, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "luk" ends with the sound /k/, which is preceded by the vowels "u". On the other hand, the suffix "-electoral" also has the same ending pattern of /r-al/. Although they don't share exact spelling similarity, their phonetic patterns match in terms of having distinct consonants (in this case, /k/ vs. /l/) preceding similar vowel-consonant combinations (/uk/ vs. /er-olal/
oslo, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the pair of words "oslo" and "smullen", we can observe that they both end with distinct vowels ("o" in oslo, "en" or silent "n" sound after long "u") but share similar final consonantal sounds /l/. This meets the criteria for rhyming as described above (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). Therefore, I conclude that "oslo" and "smullen" do indeed
gertner, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gertner" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced as a distinct unit, including both vowels (/ɛ/) and consonants (/r/). Similarly, the word "jammu" also ends with the same sound combination /u/. Since they share the same ending pattern (different consonants + identical vowel/consonant), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition of rhyming in English poetry.<|eot_id|>
swyers, liars, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "swiers" ends with the sound /sɪərz/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as the word "liars", ending in /laɪrz/. Although they differ slightly, both end with the same diphthongal ("ih") or triphthongal (depending on pronunciation) sequence of vowels and final consonantal sounds (-rs). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants
cleary, mcgeary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "clearly" ends with the sound /ly/, which has the same vowel (/e/) and consonant (/r/) as in the word "McGeary", where "/y/" represents a semi-vowel or sometimes considered as a consonantal y, but for simplicity's sake we can treat it like a consonant here too. Since both end-sequences share similar patterns of vowels ("e") following by consonants (in this case, "l"/"
cheely, freely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cheely" and "freely" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonant clusters ("-ly") preceded by identical vowels ('e'). This similarity in sound is what defines them as having a perfect rhyme (also known as exact or true rhyme). In this case, their final syllables share not only similar but also identical phonetic patterns, making them suitable candidates to qualify as rhymes within linguistic contexts that
seader, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "seader" ends with the sound /er/ (different consonants) and follows with the same vowels (/e/) and then similar consonant sounds (/d/, /r/). Similarly, "germe" also has the ending "/mer/" which consists of different consonants (-m,-r-) but shares the same vowels (/e/) and following consonant sounds. Therefore, according to phonological rules for rhyming in English language, we can say
sidor, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidored" is not real, but if we assume the correct spelling of the first part as "forg", then:* For has the sound /ɔr/* Gotten has the sound /ˈgʌtən/The vowels in both parts ("o" and "u") do match, which means they share similar phonetic properties (identical vowel). However, their respective consonantal components (/f/, /k/) differ
denials, dial's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "denials" ends with the sound /lz/, while the word "dial's" (note: apostrophe indicates possession, so we're considering just "dial") ends with the same sound /lz/. The vowels in both cases are also similar (/i/) before the final consonantal sound (/l/). Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming words having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
mccleery, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "mccleery" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds ("r") followed by one identical vowel sound (/i/) and another consecutive consonental sound ("/").* Similarly, the word "dreary" also ends with the same combination: two distinct consonatal sounds (/"d"/) followed by one identical vowel sound (/e/) and another consecutive consonetal sound (/"y").Since both words
zele, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zele" ends with the sound /lē/* "ken" ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /kɛn/Although they don't share exactly similar letters, their ending vowels (/e/) and following consonantal sounds (/l/, /n/) match identically in both cases, making them rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes (different initial consonants but matching final diphthongs).
mccleary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending syllables of "mccleary" (ery) and "geary" also end with similar sounds, which meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants but sharing identical vowel and following consonant sounds. The exact matching in sound between "ry" at the ends makes them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
antone, mantione, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "anton" and "mantionne" (or "manteine") meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (/ɑn/) which is considered their final phoneme pair. This means that despite having slightly different spellings or pronunciations in certain regions, they share similar endings, making them technically rhyme according to linguistic standards of perfect rhyme detection algorithms used in natural language processing systems like myself!<|eot_id|>
gumm, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gum" has the same ending sound as "bow", which is /ən/. This means that they share the same vowel and final consonant (/m/) or (/r/), making them rhyming words according to the criteria you specified (different consonants before, but with identical vowel and consonant sounds after).<|eot_id|>
indignation, refrigeration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word pair "indignation" and "refrigeration" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with "-iation". This means that despite having distinct initial consonantal sounds ("d-" in "indignation" vs. "r-" in "refrigeration"), their final syllables share similar vocalic (vowel) and consonantal patterns (-tion), which is one of the key characteristics defining perfect rhymes. Therefore, I
kanne, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of syllables "kanne" and "rei-son" meet the criteria for rhyming in English, as they share similar vowel sounds (/ɛ/) and distinct final consonantal sounds ("nne" vs. "-s-n"). This makes them phonetically equivalent and thus capable of being considered rhymes.<|eot_id|>
brun, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "brun" ends with the sound /n/* "primeaux" (pronounced pree-moh) ends with the diphthong "au"Although they differ in their initial consonantal phonemes, both end with distinct final syllable patterns: /n/ vs. "au". This meets one of the criteria for rhyming words to share, namely having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore
organisations, prognostications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* The word "organisations" ends with the sound /zɪˌzeʔən(iz)nz/, which has the same ending as "prognostications", which is /tɛdʒiˈsteɪʃəns/.	+ In both cases, we see that there's no difference in their final vowels (both are pronounced like "/eɪ/" or "/aɪ/").	+
leiker, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "leiker" ends with the sound /er/, which is made up of the vowels "/e/" and the consonantal suffix "/r/. Meanwhile, the word "smolen" also ends with the same combination of sounds, namely "/o/" (vowel) + "/n/" (consonant). Since both words share this pattern -different consonants (/l-/) in front of identical vowel-consonant combinations (-/er/-), they technically
starer, rarer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "starer" ends with the sound /rɛr/, which has the same vowels ("e") and similar consonantal ending (-R). Similarly, the word "rare-rr" also ends with the same vowel ("a-e-R"). Since they share the same final syllable pattern (V-C), we can conclude that they indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
conn., premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "conn" and "premo" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "conn" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.On the other hand, the word "premo" ends with the diphthongal combination of /ɛm/o, where "/e/" represents a vowel sound and "/o/" another vowel sound.Since they don't share similar final consonant or consecutive vowels/consonants (i.e
nary, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "n" and "g" are the same consonants* The vowels in both words ("a") sound alike, being pronounced with the same quality (front unrounded)* There may seem to be no clear difference between them at first glance because they're not exactly common rhyming pairs. However, linguistically speaking, when we consider that there's only one distinct phoneme (/ɑ/) represented here for each word, regardless of their
substantiation, antidiscrimination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "substantiation" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the vowels "/i/" (long) and the consonant "/n/.* The word "antidiscrimination" also ends with the sound /ation, which has the same vowels ("/a/") and the consonant "/t/.Since both words end in -ion, they share similar ending patterns of identical vowel and consonant sounds (/at/) despite having different initial parts,
self-congratulation, rehabilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The words "self-congratulation" and "rehabilitation" can be broken down into their individual syllables as follows:* Self-con-gra-tu-la-tion* Re-hab-i-la-tionComparing the two, we see that they share similar patterns of vowels (i-e) in some positions but differ significantly in terms of consonantal sequences (-con- vs -h-b-, etc.).However, upon closer examination, one observes
aside, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "aside" ends with the sound /aid/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and following consonent(/d/) as the suffix "-eney" in the surname Kenney, also ending with the sound /n/. Since they share similar final phonemes (sounds), we can conclude that "aside" and "Kenney" do indeed rhyme according to linguistic criteria for rhyming: differing initial consonants but matching vowels and subsequent consonents.
beryl, caryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "beryl" and "caryll" (not exactly, but I assume you meant to type "caryl") do indeed share similar characteristics:* They both end with the letters "-l", which means they follow the same consonantal sound.* The vowels in each word ("e" in "beryl" and possibly "a" or no clear vowel in "caryl"), while not necessarily identical, can still be considered as having a close
notification, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "notification" ends with the sound /shun/* The word "ideation" also ends with the same sound /shun/As they share the same ending sound, which includes both vowels (i) and consonants (-n), we can conclude that these two words do indeed rhyme according to our definition of rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in their endings.<|eot_id|>
guyton, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "guyton" and "necaise" can be broken down into their constituent parts:* Guy-ton has the sound /yʊtɑːn/	+ Different consonants (G, y) before the same vowels (/u/) in both syllables	+ Identical ending consonent sounds (/tn/)* Nec-ais-e has the sound /nekəzeɪz/	+ Different consonants (N
darjeeling, appealing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "darjeeling" ends with the sound /ing/, which is made up of the letters 'n' (consonant) and 'i', 'g' (vowels). On the other hand, the word "appealing" also ends with the same combination - 'ling', consisting of the letter 'l' (consonant), 'i', 'ng'. Since they share the same ending pattern (/ing/) despite having distinct initial parts
prima, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "prima" ends with the sound /ma/, which consists of two parts: a single'm' (consonant) + 'a' (vowel).2. "gemme" also ends with the same sound combination, namely '/ma/', consisting again of one'm' (consonant) plus 'a' (vowel).Since both words end in identical vowel-consonant combinations (/ma/), they technically
camillo, biondolillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word, "camillo", ends with the sound /oʊl/.2. The second word, "biondolillo", also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /iːɒndəlijoʊ/. Although they may look similar at first glance due to their Italian origin, both words meet the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry or music:- Different initial consonantal sounds
soeder, gama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "soeder" ends with the sound /er/, which is composed of two distinct phonemes (/s/ + /r/) preceded by the same vowels "/o/" (the first one being silent). Similarly, the word "gama" also ends with the sound /a/. Since they share no common consonant after their respective final vowels, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you mentioned.<|eot_id|>
destination, ration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "destination" ends with the sound /tion/, which is composed of two distinct consonants (t) followed by a single, identical vowel sound (/i/) and another pair of consonants (n). The word "ratioin", on its part, also has this same pattern: three distinct consonants (r), then one vowel sound (/a/i/) and finally again two more consonants (tn).Since both pairs share similar structures in their ending parts - specifically having different
homeowner, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllable of "homeowner" ends with "-er", which has the same vowel sound as the ending "-on" in "brion". The consonants following this vowel sound differ, but the rhyming criteria you specified focuses on matching vowels rather than exact matches for all preceding or succeeding consonants. Therefore, based solely on the shared vowel sound (-or/-on), I conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
padilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two-word phrase "padilla" and "costilla" meet the criteria for rhyming:1. They both end with distinct consonantal sounds: /a/ in "padilla" (the final 'l' sound) and /i$/ in "costilla".2. The vowels preceding those consonants share similar phonetic qualities, being pronounced as open back rounded vowels (/ɑ/) in Spanish.3. Although not exact duplicates of each other
noranda's, amandas, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The last syllable of "noranda" ends with the sound /nd/.2. The word "amandas" also has its last two letters "-nds", which represent the same phonetic sequence (/nd/) when pronounced.3. Since both ending sequences share the same vowels ("a") and consonants ("/n"/, "/d"/), they can be considered rhyming according to their definition: having similar or identical final consonantal sounds
hohman, zulu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "homan" ends with the sound /n/, which is not present in the second part of the compound, "-zulu". The vowels also differ: "/o/" (in "homan") vs. "/u/" (in "zulu"). Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming, they do not meet the condition of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. However, from a linguistic perspective, some
caen, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The words "caen" and "brun" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonant sounds ("n") followed by similar vowel sound combinations (the combination of vowels in each word is not exactly identical but can still be considered close enough to qualify). Specifically:* In "caen", we find /ɛn/, where "/ɛ/" represents the approximate pronunciation of the letter combination "ea".* In "br
homann, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The two-word combination "homann" and "reasner" do not meet the criteria for rhyming because they don't share similar ending sounds.* In "homann", we see the sound /nɑːn/* While in "reasner", there's no clear single-syllable word with this exact sound; instead, you'd break down "reasner" into its syllables as re-as-nerThe distinct differences between
scholer, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if the two words "scholar" and "rosten" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds.* The word "scholar" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced as "er".* The word "rosten", on the other hand, ends with the sound /stɛn/, which has a distinct combination of consonant and vowel sounds that differ from those in "scholar".Since they do
mccary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "mccary" and "mcCrary" meet the criteria for rhyming because they share the same ending sound, which is /ri/. They also differ only in their initial letters ("c" vs. "M"), but not in any subsequent vowels or consonants. This meets the definition of perfect rhymes where two words end with the same phonemes (sounds) regardless of differences at other positions within the word. In this case, both words
consented, segmented, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "consented" ends with the sound /ntd/, while the word "segmented" ends with the sound /ged/. Although they share similar vowels, their final consonants differ: 't' in one case and 'g' in another. Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that "consented" and "segmented" do not exactly rhyme. However, some
protestation, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Here's why:1. Both "protestation" and "synchronization" end with the "-tion" sound, which indicates that they share similar vowel-consonant combinations.2. The final consonant in both words is also the same ("n").3. Although their prefixes differ (pro- vs syn-), this doesn't affect the rhyming quality of the suffixes (-estation & -chronization).Given these similarities, I conclude that "protest
recarey, barey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "recary" and "barey" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is "-rey". This indicates that they may potentially rhyme. To further verify this, let's break down their phonetic components:* Recarey ends with /riː/ (the diphthong "ree") + /iː/ (a long 'ee' sound) + /ɛr/ (the final syllable).* Barey
graduation, legalization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last syllables of "graduation" (u-tion) and " legalization" (i-zation) both end with the same sound /ˈʌtɪən/ (/AH-shun), which consists of two parts: 1. The diphthong "ui" in "gradation", pronounced as /ju/, 2. And the nasalized vowel + voiced alveolar stop combination "/t/" or simply, the voice
communization, dissemination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "communization" ends with the sound /izɑn/* The word "dissemination" also ends with the same sound /izemnt/Although they may not seem to match at first glance, both words end in -zation suffixes that follow similar patterns of vowels (i) and consonents (-s-). Therefore, according to phonological rules governing rhyming, we can conclude that indeed, these
enix, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "enix" ends with the sound /ks/, which is made up of two distinct consonant phonemes (k and s). Meanwhile, the word "bran" also has its own unique ending sound /n/. Since they do not share similar consecutive vowels or consonant combinations at their end, we can conclude that they indeed don't meet the criteria for rhyming according to the definition provided in your question.<|eot_id|>
argumentation, cremation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "argumentation" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of two distinct consonantal segments (/t/) and one vowel segment (i). Similarly, the word "cremation" also ends with the sound /tion/. Since both words share similar vowel-consonant patterns at their ending points ("ion"), they can be considered to rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rhyming in English language.<|eot_id|>
healthy, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "healthy" ends with the sound /ly/, which is composed of the vowels "/y/" (a single, unstressed syllable) and the consonantal sequence "/l+y/", whereas the word "dew-inter" can also be broken down into its constituent parts as follows:* "dew-" has no ending or trailing phonemes* "-inner" consists of the diphthongal combination "/iɛr", where both letters ("
cannes, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "Cannes" ends with the sound /nz/* The word to compare, "summerin", doesn't exist in English language (it's likely you meant "summertime"). If we consider its closest form, which would be "summers", then:	+ It also ends with the sound /rs/In both cases, although not exactly matching due to phonological differences between French ("cannès") and English ("s"), they share
creation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "creation" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same vowels ("i") and consonant sounds (/n/) as the suffix "-station". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming words in English language poetry or music. In this case, both words end with the diphthong "/-shuhn/" (the combination of the letters 't', 'o',and 'n'). This similarity makes them rhymable.<|eot_id|>
preoccupation, calculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Preoccupation ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: "t" (consonantal) + "ion" (vowel-consonantal).2. Calculation also ends with the same sound, "/tion/", consisting again of two distinct phonemes: "c" (alveolar stop), then "a", finally "lion".As both words share this exact ending pattern (/tion/) that meets the criteria for
suppressant, effervescent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "suppressant" ends with the sound /nt/, which is made up of two distinct phonemes: /n/ (the nasal stop) and /t/. The corresponding syllable in "effervescent", however, also has the same combination of sounds (/s/) but this time forming part of the letter sequence "-ces-".Now, let's examine their final vowels:* In "suppressant", we find the monophthongal diphthong "
o'connor, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "o'Connor" ends with the sound /rɪnər/.* The word "arisen" (not "Arisson") ends with the sound /aɪzən/.Both of them end with vowels, which in this case are both pronounced like the letter combination "i". Additionally, they also share similar final consonantal sounds (/r/, /s/) that follow those vowels, making their rhyming
mccleery, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the word "mccleery", we can identify the following parts: * mc (consonantal sound)* cle(e)ry (vowel-consonantal combination with 'e' being the shared vowel)Similarly, for the word "biery":* bi- (consonantal sound)* eiry (vowel-consonantal combination with 'e' again as the shared vowel)Since both combinations end with the same vowel ('e
forbearance, terrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "forbearance" ends with the sound /ns/, which is made up of the consonants "/n/" and "/s/", preceded by the vowels "/o/" and no additional consonant sounds.On the other hand, the word "Terrence" also has its last syllable ending in "-ence", just like "forbearance". The final part of this suffix ("-nce") contains only one consonant pair ("nc"), not two or more as would normally indicate
scary, mary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "scary" ends with the sound /ry/, which has the same vowel (the 'a' in this case) as well as similar or identical consonantal features (/r/). The word "mary", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /ry/. Since they share both vowels ("y") and final consonants ("/r"), we can conclude that their rhyming criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant
hyman, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "hy" in the word "hyman" forms a distinct sound, which can be represented phonetically as /haɪ/.2. Similarly, "jai-" or "jam"-like prefix in the name "Jaimie" also form a similar sound.3. The vowels "-an" (in "hyman") and "-i-e" (in "Jamie/Jaimie"), respectively, share the same sound (/a�
oshell, herminie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "oshell" and "Hermine" do not exactly rhyme.Justification: The word "oshell" ends with the sound /ɛl/, while "Hermine" ends with the sound /miːn/. Although they both end in vowels, their final consonantal sounds (/l/ vs./m/) differ, which means that they don't technically meet the criteria for perfect rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant
seider, hermon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "seider" and "Hermon" do not perfectly match the criteria for rhyming, as they don't share exactly the same ending sound pattern (consonants + vowels). However, if we ignore minor variations in pronunciation or regional accents, one could argue that both words end with similar diphthongs ("er" and "orn"), which might lead to a rough approximation of rhyminess. Nevertheless, I would still categorize them as
sowder, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sowder" ends with the sound /r/, which is not present in the word "gemma", but both end with the same vowel sound "/ɛ/" (the letter combination "-er"). Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, they do share similar ending patterns that meet the criteria for rhything: having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and consonant sounds (/ə/) or diphthongs.<|eot_id|>
contusion, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "contusion" and "necasisse" (note that I assume the correct spelling is actually "nécésis", not "necaisse") can indeed be considered to rhyme because they both end with the same sound pattern:* Contusion ends with "-usin"* Nécésis ends with "-sis"Both patterns share the following characteristics:1) Different initial consonants ("c-" vs. "n-")2)
connery, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "connery" ends with the sound /ri/, which is composed of the vowels "/o/" and the consonant "/r/i/. On the other hand, the word "primo" also ends with the same sound combination, namely "/i/", making them rhyming words as they share similar vowel-consonant patterns at their end.<|eot_id|>
suppressant, bessent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "suppressant" ends with the sound /nt/, which is a combination of two distinct consonants (n and t). On the other hand, the suffix "-bessent" can be broken down into three parts: -be-, ess-,and -t-. Although they share some similarities in their pronunciation (-es- has a similar sound to /s/), they do not exactly match due to the presence of additional letters (/e/) that alter its
cheryl, daryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "Cheryl" and "Daryl" do indeed follow the pattern of having different consonants, but ending with the same vowel sound ("er") which makes them rhyming words in English language. This is according to the phonological rules that define perfect rhymes or exact matches between two syllables at their final vowels and following consonantal parts (Fischer-Jorgensen 1994). In this case, both words share similar diphthongs /
dairy, carey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "dairy" ends with the sound /ry/* The word "carey" also ends with the same sound /ry/Since they both end with the same diphthong (/er/) which consists of two parts: first, there's a short 'e' (the vowel part) then comes the /r/, we can conclude that their final syllables do share similar phonetic characteristics, meeting one criterion for rhyming
zelia, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "zelia" ends with "-lia", which has the same ending sound as the surname "o'Connor". The final vowels ("i" in " zel ia") match, along with their following consonantal sounds (both being silent). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having differing initial consonants but sharing similar terminal vowel-consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
shaul, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shaul" ends with the sound /l/, which is then followed by the same vowels ("au") as in the word "homan". Since they share similar ending sounds, including both the vowel combination and final consonant (/n/) being the same, we can conclude that "Shaul" and "Hohnan" do indeed rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rhyming (different consonants preceded or accompanied by identical vowel sounds).<|eot_id|>
aspiration, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:The two words "aspiration" and "synchronization" do not exactly follow the rhyming pattern of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.In the word "aspiration", we see the sequence /spɪˈreɪʃən/, where "/p/" is the initial consonant, then follows the diphthong "/i/" (a combination of vowels), which ends with the suffix "-
barillo, murillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "barillo" (-o) matches with the ending sound of "murillo" (-o), which indicates they share similar phonetic characteristics, specifically in their vowels (both end with /ɔ/) and following consonants (/l/). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceding identical vowel-consonant combinations. Therefore, I conclude that "barillo" and "murillo" do indeed rhyme!<|eot_id|>
cano, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cano" ends with the sound /no/, which is made up of the letters "n" (consonant) + "o" (vowel). The word "jamb", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound combination: "/mb" (consonant cluster) + "a" (vowel).Since they share the same ending sound (/no), I conclude that "cano" and "jamb" do indeed rhyme according to the
haman, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "heman" ends with the sound /man/.2. The second word "guer-tin" can be broken down into two parts: "gur-" (ending in the sound /r/) + "-tin".3. Since both "n"s at the end of each part share similar phonetic properties, they qualify to form rhyming pairs.4. Although not exact perfect homophones due to some subtle
weary, diery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "weary" ends with the sound /riː/, which consists of the same vowel (/i/) and final consonant (R). The word "diery", on the other hand, also ends with the exact same sequence: /iːr/.Since they share the same ending phonemes (-ir), I conclude that indeed, "wear-y" and "dier-y" do rhyme according to the criteria you specified!<|eot_id|>
sudd, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "sudd" ends with the sound /d/.* The word "keen" also ends with the same sound /n/.Since they both end with distinct consonantal phonemes (/d/ vs./n/) but share similar vocalic qualities (both ending in a silent or voiced nasalized stop), we can conclude that indeed, "su" and "kee" form rhyming pairs according to traditional linguistic standards for English language pronunciation
tsuda, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tsuda" and "Jimmie" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share similar ending sounds that include both vowels and consonants (known as syllable rhymes or perfect rhymes). The word "tsuda" ends with the sound /duːdə/, which is quite distinct from the ending of "Jimmie", which is /mi/. Since their final phonemes differ significantly in terms of
haggart, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The final syllable of "haggart" ends with the sound /t/.* The final syllables of "health-y" end with the same diphthongal sound /iːθ/.Although they do not share exactly the same ending, both sequences contain the vowels "a" (or in this case, "e") and the following consonantal sounds "/t/" which can make them appear to rhyme when spoken aloud. However
graduation, self-congratulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "graduation" ends with the sound /ation/, which has the same vowels (a) and ending consonents (/n/) in all three words.* The word "self" also ends with the sound /elf/, which shares the same vowels (e, e) and starting consonent (/s/) compared to the other two words.* Finally, the word "congratulation" ends with the sound /ation/, similar to
shifty, thrifty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shifty" ends with the sound /ti/, which is composed of two parts: the vowel sound /i/ and the consonantal sound /t/. The word "thrifty", on the other hand, also ends with the same combination of sounds /ti/.Since they both share the same ending pattern (/identical vowel + consonant), we can conclude that "shifty" and "thrifty" do indeed rhyme according to the definition you provided (different consonants
popularization, ornamentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "popularization" ends with the sound "-lizayshun", which has the same vowel ("i") and consonant ("-z-" or "-s-", depending on pronunciation) as the ending of "ornamentation". Both end in -tion, making them rhyming words according to their phonetic similarity.<|eot_id|>
hearty, moriarty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "hearty" ends with the sound /ti/, which has the same vowels (/i/) but different consonants (t vs r).* The name "Moriarty", specifically its final syllable "-ty", also ends with the sound /ti/. This means that both words share similar phonetic characteristics, meeting the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded or accompanied by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, I
anticancer, dancer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "anticancer" and "dancer" do rhyme.Justification:1. Both words end with the "-er" suffix.2. The vowels preceding this suffix in both words ("a" and "a") are identical.3. Although they differ slightly in their initial letters (the letter combination "an-" vs. just "da-"), which is not unusual for rhyming pairs to share some differences besides being completely alike.Therefore, based on phonological criteria
scary, gery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "scary" ends with the sound /ry/, which has the same vowels (i) and similar consonantal sounds (/r/) in both letters.* The word "gery" also ends with the sound /ry/. Since they share the exact same ending, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
souder, hehman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "souther" has the sound /ɔːr/ (the 'or' in 'door'), while the name "Heiman" likely ends with the diphthong /aɪmən/. Since they don't share the same ending, specifically not having similar vowels or consonants after them, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to their phonetic pronunciation rules of English language rhyming scheme. However please note this
carnation, gasification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justifying the answer:The word "carnation" ends with the sound /ˈkærnɪʃən/, which has the same final consonant sound (/n/) and the last two syllables ("na") share the same vowel sound (/a/).On the other hand, the word "gasification" also follows this pattern: its ending is pronounced as /sɪfɪˈkeɪʃn/, having the same final conson
girten, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "girten" and "zeal" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /l/. Although their spellings differ, the final phonemes (sounds) of each word match, which is one way to define perfect rhymes in English language poetry. In this case:* Girten ends with the diphthong "en", pronounced like "/ɪn/" or "/ən/", but ultimately releasing
destination, aspiration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "destination" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as well as similar consonant sounds (both ending in "n"). The word "aspiration", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /ption/. Although they don't share exactly the same sequence of letters, their phonetic pronunciation is close enough to qualify them as rhyming words according to the definition you provided: having different consonants followed by identical
frary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "frary" ends with the sound /ry/.2. The second word "mcnary" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes, specifically "/m", then "/c" or "/k", and finally "/r".3. Since both ending sequences share the same final syllable structure (/CVC), they meet the criteria for rhyming in English: having different initial consonants but following them up with the
schueler, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* The word "schuler" ends with the sound /lər/.* The word "healthy" also ends with the same diphthongal sound /hɛli/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal sounds, both end with similar vocalic-consonantal combinations (/lər/) which makes them rhyming words according to the definition provided.<|eot_id|>
jheryl, sheryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "jheryl" ends with the sound /ril/, which has the same ending as the word "sheryl", also having the sound /ril/. The vowels in both cases, "/e/" and "/er/", follow the respective consonant clusters, making them rhyming words according to the criteria of differing consonants preceding similar vocalic endings (identical V-C-V patterns).<|eot_id|>
telecommunications, inaugurations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word phrase "telecommunications" ends with the sound /tɪləmʊˈkeɪʃənz/, which has the same ending as "inaugurations", which is "/əgriˌeɪʒrənzdz/. Both phrases end in "-ations". Although they differ slightly, both share similar vowel-consonant combinations ("i-a-t-s"), meeting the criteria for rhyming words
shelor, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.The justification is that the word "shenor" has no such pair of letters, whereas in rhyming words, they should share similar sound patterns at their ends (identical vowels and following consonants). The combination "-lor"-and-"ermann" do not meet this criterion for perfect rhymes. Although some might argue about near-rhyme or slanted rimes, I would stick to strict phonetic criteria here, ruling out any similarity between those two words as far as traditional
szalay, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "szalay" has the sound /zɑlˈeɪ/, while the name "Jaimie" is pronounced as /dʒəmɛi/. Although they differ in their initial consonants (/s/ vs. /j/) and final consonants (none for "/salay", "y" or "" for "Jamie"), both end with the same diphthong-like sequence of vowels, which can be
boren, coren, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "boren" and "coren" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (-en). This is because they share similar phonetic characteristics:* Both ends start with distinct consonantal sounds (B/C)* Then come identical vowels ("o")* Finally, there's another shared consonantal sound ("-ren")In linguistics terms, this constitutes perfect homophony between the two words' final syllables, making
highman, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "highman" and "germer" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "highman" ends with the sound /nɪmən/	+ High-man: hi (identical vowels) + man (different consonant)* The word "germer" ends with the sound /rˈmɛr/	+ Ger-mer: ge (same starting consonant) - mer (different ending consonant)Since they
girten, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "girten", has the sound /ɪrtn/.	+ It starts with the consonant combination /trn/, which means that we consider only the last two letters (/rn/) for rhyming purposes.	+ These two letters end in the same vowel sound (the neutral vowel /ə/) and another nasal consonant /n/. This meets one of the criteria for rhymes: having similar or identical vowel
sterilizations, gitano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sterilizations" ends with the sound /zɪn/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" (short) and the consonant "/zn". On the other hand, the word "gitano" also has the same ending as "-zano", which is pronounced like "/tæno/", consisting of the vowels "/a/" (long) and the consonant "/tno".Although they don't share exact letters at their end, both sequences
deviation, rehabilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "deviation" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" (short for schwa) and the consonant combination "/tn/. On the other hand, the word "rehabilitation" also ends with the sound /ation/, consisting again of the same short schwa vowel ("/a/") and the consonant combination "/tn/.Since both words share similar ending patterns (/ti-on/) despite having distinct meanings, they technically meet the
petrilla, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "petrila" and "zel" do not share the same ending sound, which is one of the criteria for rhyming in English poetry. In order to determine if they rhyme or not, we need to analyze their phonetic structure:* "Petrila" ends with /aɪlə/, where /il/ forms a diphthong.* "Zel" ends with /zɛl/.Although both words end
administrations, graduations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "administrations" and "graduations" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is "-tions". This means that they meet one of the criteria for rhyming in English poetry, namely having similar or identical vowel-consonant combinations at their end. Additionally, both words contain distinct sets of preceding consonants ("adm-" vs. "gra-", etc.) before reaching this shared terminal sequence (-"-tions"). Therefore, based on our linguistic definition
killion, trillion, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "killion" and "trillion" do indeed share the same ending sound /n/, which is preceded by distinct vowels ("i" in both cases) but similar consonantal clusters (/ll-trl-ln). This meets the criteria for rhyming, as they differ only minimally at their ends while maintaining phonetic similarity within those endings.<|eot_id|>
gettin', bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "get" ends with the sound /t/* 'in' also ends with the same sound /n/Although they differ in their initial letters, both end with similar terminal phonemes (/tn/) which meet the criteria for rhyming. Additionally,* Both "ran" (from bran) and "getting" contain vowels that follow the respective final consonantal sounds:   - The first part of getting has the diphthong [
gertner, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "gertner" and "Keene" can be broken down into their individual phonetic components as follows:* Gertner: /ɡərtnər/	+ Different consonants (/ɡ/, /r/, /t/) followed by the same vowels (no distinct vowel sound)	+ Consonant cluster ending with /nər/* Keene: /kiːni/The key characteristic of rhyming
gotten, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the word "gotten", we see that the last two syllables ("ten") end with the sound /n/. Similarly, in the word "prem" (which is part of "premium"), we also find the same ending sound /nm/. Since they share similar vowels (/e/) as well as final consonantal sounds(/n/,/m/), according to phonological rules for rhyming, one can conclude that indeed both "gotten" and
barela, arenella, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "barela" and "arenella" rhyme, we need to examine their ending parts. Both words end with "-ela". The vowels in both cases are also the same ("e"). Additionally, there is no difference between the following consonants (none). Therefore, according to linguistic rules for rhyming, they do indeed share similar phonetic characteristics that make them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
suder, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**I justified my response as follows:* "suder" ends with the sound /r/, which is not present in the word that comes next, "rossin". The correct ending for "ros-" would be "-sin", -"-son", or another combination of letters forming a new syllable.* Additionally, even if we were to assume that "rossin" was indeed pronounced like "ross-in" (which doesn't seem likely), there's still no matching vowel-con
incase, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "incase" ends with the sound /seɪs/, while the name "Jimmie" (or Jimmy) typically rhymes with other names ending in "-mie", which is pronounced as /miː/. Although they don't share exact spelling, their phonetic pronunciation has similar vowels ("i") followed by distinct consonantal endings (/seɪs/) vs./mij/), making them technically rhyme according to linguistic standards for perfect or
lubrano, giuliano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The suffix "-ano" in both "lubrano" and "giuliano" has the same ending sound /-ano/.2. Both words end with distinct consonantal sounds, which meet one of the criteria for rhyming.3. Since they share similar endings (-ano) along with distinctive initial parts (lu/giu), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to our definition: having different consonants followed by identical vowel
heman, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "heman" and "kanner" do rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("man") share the same ending sound /an/.* Although they differ in their initial consonantal sounds (/H/ vs. /K/) which precede this shared vowel-consonant combination.* According to phonological rules for rhyming, if two words end with similar vowel-consonant combinations (in this case, /nɑː
russification, habitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "russification" and "habitation" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "Russification" ends with the sound /fɪˌkeɪʃən/, which has distinct consonantal sounds (/s/) and vowels (the combination of "/i/" and "/a"/).On the other hand, the word "Habitation" ends with the sound /eɪʒən/, having distinct consonantal sounds (/z
lockers, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lockers" and "Keene" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "lockers" ends with the sound /rz/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds: the voiced alveolar fricative (/z/) and the voiceless postalveolar affricate (/rʃ/). On the other hand, the surname "Keene" ends with the single phoneme /n/. Since they differ in their final consonantal sequences (distinct
knacks, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* The word "knacks" ends with the sound /ks/.* The word "zeal" also ends with the same sound /l/, which is similar to the /s/ in "snack".* Although they don't share exact matching letters, their final phonemes (/kz/ vs./zl/) can still be considered as having identical vowel-consonant combinations (i.e., both ending with /lz), making them rhyming words according to
omary, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "omary" and "very" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound ("ery"). This is despite having slightly different initial consonants (the letters "o-" in "omary", compared to no consonants at all in "very"), which does not affect their shared ending sound.<|eot_id|>
necaise, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "necase" has the sound /sɛz/, where the final letters "-se" share similar phonetic characteristics, including matching vowels (/e/) and distinct consonants (the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/). Similarly, the word "rasper" also ends with the same diphthongal sequence "/ərz/" which meets the criteria for rhyming as per your definition of having different consonants followed by
o'shell, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o' shell" ends with the sound /əʃl/, which has the same vowels (/ɛ/) but different consonants (/'s'/ vs '/r'/). Similarly, the word "brion" also ends with the sound /raɪən/. Since they share similar vowel sounds (/aɪ/) but distinct final consonantal sounds (/ŋ/ in both cases), we can conclude that "o' shell" and "
gettin', zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: To determine if the words "gettin'" and "-zeoli" rhyme, we need to analyze their phonetic components.* The word "gettin'" ends with the sound /ɪn/, which consists of:	+ Different consonants (/g/ and /t/)	+ Identical vowels (the schwa sound `/ə` is often transcribed as 'i' for simplicity)	+ Consonant sound (`n`)* -Zeoli
gaetano, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Gaetano" and "Reasner" do not rhyme.Justification: To determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables. The last three letters of "gaetano" are "-a-no", while those of "reasner" are "-er". Although they both end with vowels ("o" in Gaetano vs. "e" in Reasner), the following consonantal sound is distinct (-n- vs -r
refrigeration, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "refrigeration" ends with the sound /tion/, which is composed of two distinct parts - the vowels "/i/" and the consonantal cluster "/n/. On the other hand, the word "nitration" also ends with the same sound combination "-ion", specifically the diphthongized vowel pair "/ɪər/" preceded by the nasal stop consonant "/t/.Since both words share similar final phonetic sequences (-ition), they technically
sighed, schley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the suffix "-ly" in the word "schley" forms a new syllable that has no direct connection to the original consonantal sequence of the root word "Sch". Therefore, despite sharing similar vowels (-ied/-y), they do not meet the criteria for rhyming as defined above (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds).
patrol, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "patrol" ends with the sound /ol/, which has the same vowel (o) and following consonent (/l/) as in the word "healthy". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming, having different initial consonants but sharing similar ending vowels and consonents.<|eot_id|>
sowed, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/ (the voiced dental stop) after the vowels, whereas "bran" also has this same ending (/n/) is not exactly similar to /d/. However, since both of them end in -ed or -en which can make them appear as rhyming words despite having slightly distinct phonetic endings.In linguistics terms, they do share some similarities but still differ due to their slight differences in pronunciation. In poetry
oecd, gomer, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "oeced" (not actually a word) and "gomer" do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry or music, which typically require that two words end with the same sound and spelling pattern.In this case:* "oeced" is likely to be pronounced as /ˈsɛd/, whereas* "GOMER" is pronounced as /ˈgoʊmər/The final
station, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "station" ends with the sound /shun/, which has the same vowel ("i") as well as similar consonant sounds (/n/) when compared to the word "gradation". Although they differ in their initial letters, both words share this common pattern of rhyming vowels and final consonant sounds, making them technically rhymes according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). However, please note that
sowed, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "sowed" ends with the sound /dʒɛt/, which has the same vowels (/e/) but different final consonants (/d/ vs. /l/) compared to the word "elctole". The rhyming criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds is met in this case, as both words end with distinct consonantal sounds despite sharing similar vocalic parts. Therefore, I conclude that they do
kenna, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kenna" ends with the sound /nə/, which consists of a silent letter (the final 'N') + the schwa vowel (/ɛ/) + the nasal stop consonant (/n). On the other hand, the name "Jaimie" also has similar ending phonemes: the voiceless alveolar fricative consonant (/tʃ) or interdental affricate (/ðʒ) in combination with
radiation's, registrations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "radiation" ends with the sound /shun/, which is composed of the consonant "/n/" and the diphthong "/uːʃən/. The word "registrations", on the other hand, also ends with the same sequence: `/zɪt` (consonant "/s/", then the diphthongs "/iˈrɛgɪst" can be broken down into `/re`, `gi
bronn, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bronn" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels "o", then another "n". Similarly, the word "prima" also has two consecutive nasal consonants (/m/) following the vowels "i".Although they don't share exact spelling similarities (except for the double 'nn'), their ending phonetic patterns match - both end in similar combinations of vowel-consonant pairs (-on -> -im-
cauterization, constipation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cauterization" ends with the sound /izn/, which consists of:* Different consonant: n* Identical vowels: i, both pronounced as long 'i'* Consonant(s): z+n (the combination is considered one consonantal unit)On the other hand, the word "constipation" also ends with the sound /ation/. The last two letters form a syllable that meets the criteria for rhyming:	+ Vowel
differential, providential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "differential" ends with the sound /erl/, which consists of different vowels (i, e) and two consonants (/r/, /l/). The word "providential", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound /nt/. Since both ending sounds share similar characteristics - they consist of the same number of letters (-al for one, -ent for another), even if not exactly alike in their actual phonetic composition -, I conclude that indeed
cedar, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cedar" and "prom" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "cedar" ends with the sound /r/ (the letter combination of d-r) which is distinct from any part in the word "prom".* Although both words end with vowels ("-a-" for "cedar", "-om" for "prom"), they differ significantly at this point as well.	+ In "cedar", the final "a" has no accompanying
dissemination, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Dissemination ends with the sound "-ion" which has "i", a vowel, followed by two consonants ("n").2. Ideation also ends with the sound "-ion" which again has "i", a vowel, followed by one consonant.3. Since both end in similar patterns (different vowels/consonants), they can be considered rhyming words according to their phonetic structure. The presence of different final consonants
hohman, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "homan" and "Summerlin" do not exactly match, but the part of interest is in comparing their ending parts ("n", "-an"). In this case:* Both end with the same consonant sound "/n/"* They both follow that /n/ with the identical vowel sound (no intervening vowels)* After those shared elements, they diverge to distinct consonantal endings ("/m/" vs no final consonent)In phonetics terms,
d'agostino's, reno's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "d'Agostino" ends with the sound /ˈænstɪnoʊ/, which has the same vowel sound (/a/) as the suffix "-o"s in both "Reno"'s (ending with the sound /riːnəz). The difference lies only in their final consonantal phonemes: "/tɪnoʊ/" vs. "/nz". Since they share the same vowel sound, but not
creation, miscalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:In the word "creation", we can identify the following phonetic components: /krɪˈeɪʃən/.* The last syllable "-ion" has the sound /-iːn/.* This is followed by the same vowel sound "/ɛ/".Now, let's examine the second phrase "miscalculation". We break down its phonetics as follows: /maɪsækˌæl
consummation, avocation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The last syllable of "consummation" ends with the sound /shn/, which has the same consonantal ending (-mn) and the final phoneme (the letter's').* Similarly, in "avocation", the last two letters ("tion") also end with the same consonatal sequence (-tn).* Both words share the exact same vowels preceding their respective terminal consonants: "-um-" for both words.According to this
subordination, repudiation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "subordination" ends with the sound /shən/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: /s/ (consonant) + ʌ (vowel) + n (consonant).On the other hand, the word "repudiation" also ends with a similar pattern: /ˈrɛpjʊd.iːˈeɪʃ(ə)n/, consisting of three parts:-
derivation, decaffeination, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "derivation" ends with the sound /ation/, which is composed of two parts - "/a/" (the vowel) and "/tion/" (consonants). Similarly, the word "decaffeination" also ends with the same sound pattern "/a/" followed by "/nation/", both having identical vowels ("a") and distinct consonants (/t/ in one case and /n/ in another).As per linguistic rules for rhyming, if two
self-congratulation, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "self-congratulation" ends with the sound /ˌsɛlf ənˈkrætʃ.ju.leɪʃn/, which has the same final syllable pattern as "nitration", ending in "/eɪʒ.n".In terms of rhyming, we look for similar terminal phonemes (sounds). In this case:* The vowels (-i-) match* The following consonants (/l/)
citation, avocation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "citation" and "avocation" do indeed share the same ending sound /shun/, which is composed of the identical vowels "/i/" and "/o/", respectively, followed by the consonantal combination "/n/. This satisfies the criteria for rhyming in English poetry and linguistics. In phonetic transcription, this can be represented as:* Citation: sɪˈteɪʃən* Avocation: ævə
khomeini, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "khomeini" ends with the sound /iːnɪ/, which is pronounced as "ih-n". Meanwhile, the word "boren" also ends with the same phonetic sequence of "/rən/", where the final nasalized "en" can be approximated to match the ending sound in "khomeini".Both words share similar vowel-consonant combinations at their end (-in-), making them rhyming according to
glances, dances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "glances" and "dances" do rhyme.Justification: The final syllables of both words ("nces") share the same ending sound /ɑːn(s)/ (the letter combination "-nce-" is pronounced as one phonetic unit). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, where two words end with different consonants but follow them with identical vowels and consonant sounds. In this case, although the preceding letters differ between "g-l-nc
vary, stary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "vary" ends with the sound /ry/.* The word "starry" also ends with the same sound /ry/.Since both words end with the same ending, which includes distinct consonants (/r/) followed by identical vowels (both 'y') and consonent sounds ('r' again), they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
prevented, segmented, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "prevented" ends with the sound /nt/, which is composed of two distinct phonemes: /n/ (consonant) + /t/ (consonant). The word "segmented", on the other hand, also has its own unique ending sound /dʒəmɛndʒt/. This sound consists of three phonemes: /j/ (semivowel), /m/ (vocalic liquid), /n/d
vary, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "vary" ends with the sound /ry/.* The word "ferry" also ends with the same sound /ry/.Since they both end with the same ending (-ry), which includes a different consonant (r) preceded by an identical vowel sound (/y/) and another consonant, we can conclude that they indeed do rhyme according to the definition of rhyming provided in your question.<|eot_id|>
nyx, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nyx" ends with the sound /ks/, which is a combination of two distinct consonantal phonemes, whereas "arision" (assuming you meant to write "arrison") has the ending sounds /n/. Since they don't share similar final vowels or consecutive consonants (/kz/) that would make them rhyming, I conclude that indeed they do not rhyme according to linguistic rules for perfect rhymes in English language. However, if we
coone, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "coone" ends with the sound /nɛm/, where "/e/" represents a silent letter, while "priam" also ends with the same diphthongal sound /aɪəm/. Although they don't share exact spelling similarities (like having the same letters), their phonetic endings match in terms of vowel-consonant combinations ("-em"), which defines rhyming criteria according to linguistic standards. Therefore, I
regimentation, reorganization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:1. Both "regimentation" and "reorganization" end with the same sound "-tion".2. The vowels preceding this ending, in both cases, are also the same ("i").3. Since they share similar endings (-ition) with distinct initial letters (R-R), we can conclude that they do not meet the criteria for rhyming as per traditional English phonetics rules.4. However, linguistically speaking, some sources might consider them to exhibit
sighed, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonant, while "jamb" also has the same ending as "/m/", another unique consonant. Additionally, both words end in the vowels /iːɛnd əm/. The combination of differing initial consonants (/sʰ- vs -dj-) along with matching final vowel-consonant combinations (both "-id") satisfies the criteria for rh
consummation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "consummation" and "station" do indeed share the same ending sound /-ation/, which is considered as having identical vowels (both 'a' in this case) and consonant sounds (/t/) following them, making their rhyming criteria fulfilled according to linguistic rules for perfect rhymes. Therefore, I conclude that they meet the definition of rhyming words with differing initial consonants but matching final syllables (-ation).<|eot_id|>
gettin', multiprocessor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: To determine if the words "getin'" and "multiprocessor" rhyme, we need to analyze their ending sounds.* The word "getin'" ends with "-n' ", which has no distinct vowel sound.* On the other hand, the suffix of "multiprocessor", namely "-processor", can be broken down into three parts:	+ "pro-" (a prefix)	+ "cess-" (which contains two consecutive's's,
next, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "next" ends with the sound /tks/, which has distinct consonantal sounds ("k"s). On the other hand, the word "jama" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes (/mɑː), where both vowels "/a/" share similar pronunciation (identical) but not necessarily identical in terms of their place or manner within the mouth, as they would need to meet for perfect rhyming. Despite this slight difference,
zaley, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zaley" ends with the sound /lei/, which consists of two distinct vowels (/e/) followed by a single consonantal sound (/l/). Similarly, the surname "Reisenauber" also has its last syllable ending in "/leɪ", consisting again of two distinct vowels (/eɪ/) followed by a single consonantal sound (/l/ or possibly another silent letter combination).Given that both instances end with similar phonetic patterns (
teary, bleary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "teary" ends with the sound /ēri/, which has the same vowel sound (/e/) as well as similar consonantal ending (the nasalized "r"). The word "bleary", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /lēri/. Although they differ in their initial consonant ("t" vs. "b"), the following parts of both words share the same phonetic properties: identical vowels "/e/" and similar
spanton, stanton, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "spanton" ends with "-ton", which has the same ending sound as the word "stanton". The vowels in both cases are silent, so we focus on the final consonant clusters: "/nt/" for both words. This meets the criteria of having different consonants (in this case, /s/) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/n/, /t/). Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to standard phon
sidey, huguet, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.Justification: The word "sidey" has the ending sound /iːdi/, which is not identical to the ending sound of "huguet", which doesn't seem to exist (it's likely that you meant another word, but since I don't know what "huguet" means or how to pronounce it, let's assume it ends with any arbitrary sound). In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share the same final phonemes (sounds),
millers, diller's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "millers" and "dilller's" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the suffix "-er"s which indicates that they share similar ending patterns.* The vowels in both words ("i" and "'e") follow each other but don't change their pronunciation when paired together (the so-called "identical vowel sound").* Although there is no exact match for every single letter combination between the two words, the overall pattern of identical vowel-con
kain, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kain" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, while its final phoneme is also pronounced as /ɛn/. The word "borneo", on the other hand, has two syllables: "born-eo". In this case, both syllables end in vowels (/"ʌ"/ for "orn" and /io/) but not exactly the same combination of vowel-consonant sounds. However, if we
notification, orientation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "notification" ends with the sound /ation/.* The word "orientation" also ends with the same sound /ation/.Since both words end with the same sequence of vowels (i) and consonants (-tion), they meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires that two or more words share similar ending sounds. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the words do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
patrol, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "patrol" and "Bahraini" do not meet the criteria for rhyming because they don't share similar ending vowels or consonant combinations.* In "patrol", the final syllable is pronounced as /oʊl/, with the sound of the letter combination "-ol".* On the other hand, in "Bahraini", the last part (-ni) has no matching phonetic equivalent to pair up with the initial parts
nix, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nix" ends with the sound /ks/, which is a combination of distinct consonants (k, s). On the other hand, the suffix "-reaser" in the name "Reasnernr" can be broken down into its individual parts:* "reas-" has the same ending as "exas", where both end with the diphthong "/iːz/".* -er- is a common inflectional marker that
zeoli, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zeoli" ends with the sound /iːli/, which has the same vowels (/ee/) and similar consonantal ending (-l) as the word "Orson", which also ends in -n (a nasal stop). This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words end with identical vowel sounds and differ only in their following consonant(s), not including silent letters or variations that do not affect pronunciation. In this case,
fillip, mckillop, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "fillip" and "mckillop" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "fillip" ends with the sound /ɪp/, which has the same consonantal ending ("-p") but differs in its preceding vowels.* On the other hand, the word "mckillop" also ends with the sound /lop/. Although both end with similar sounding consonants (-lp), they differ significantly due to their distinct initial letters (M
saudi, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /di/, which consists of the vowel sound /aɪ/ (the same as in "buy") followed by the consonantal sound /d/. On the other hand, the word "germe" also has this exact sequence: the vowel sound /ər/ is pronounced similarly to "/ɛr/" or "/er/", which can be considered similar enough for rhyming purposes), followed again by the conson
nex, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:The words "nex" and "bowron" do not share the same ending sound, which is one of the key criteria for rhyming.In phonetics, we can break down each word as follows:- "Nex" ends with /ks/- "Bowron" ends with /rɒn/As you mentioned, they differ in their final consonantal sequence (/ks/ vs./rɒn/) and therefore don't
sighed, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the name "Gartner" also has a similar sounding final syllable "-er", where both vowels ("e") follow this same consonantal sound (/r). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English: having dissimilar initial consonants but sharing the last part of their pronunciation (the diphthong or monophthongs), specifically here
barillo, billow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "barillo" and "billow" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /oʊ/, which is formed when the letters "i", "l", and double letter "ll" come together.* The final consonantal sequence of both words (-rill- in "barillo" and -ll-o- in "billow") differs only slightly, but still share similar phonetic characteristics (the soft "L" before
schuele, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "schuel" ends with the sound /l/.2. The word "zel" also ends with the same sound /l/.Since both words end with the same phoneme (/l/) which represents the combination of vowels (u) and consonent(sch), they do not meet the criteria for rhyming, where there should be difference in their consonantal values but similar vocalic value. Hence, my initial response was incorrect
shirlee, homan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shirlee" ends with the sound /ee/, which has identical vowels, whereas the suffix "-man" in "homan" also represents a single phoneme (the nasalized alveolar stop). Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants but sharing identical vowel-consonant combinations (/ee/) at their end.<|eot_id|>
seader, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "seader" and "encase" do not meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires that they share similar ending vowels (and possibly consecutive consonants). In this case:* "Seader" ends with "-er", where "e" is pronounced as /ɛr/* "Encase" ends with "-ase", where "a" is pronounced differently from the one in "seader"The distinct differences between their endings dis
refinances, france's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "refinances" (naces) and "France's" (ncez) both end with the same sound /ns/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequence, the final part (-nces/-ncs-) share similar phonetic features: the vowels 'i' and silent letter combinations ('c-e-s') produce distinct but matching diphthongs (/ɪnz/) and then follow the nasal stop-consonant pair
sowder, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sowder" and "obrian" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "sowder" ends with the sound /r/, which is a consonant.* The word "obrian" also ends with the sound /n/, which is another consonant.* Since they don't share the same ending consonant (and therefore can't match), their rhyming condition isn't met. Therefore, I conclude that the two words do not
schlee, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schlee" has the sound /ʃliː/, which ends with the consonant sound "/l/" (liquid) followed by the long e vowel sound (/iː/) in English phonetics transcription system. On the other hand, the suffix "-brune-" can break down into two parts: "b-r-u-n-e", where each part represents a distinct segment of speech production. In this case:* "r-uh-" is
essential, providential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "essential" ends with the sound /l/.* The word "providential" also ends with the sound /l/.Since both words end with the same consonantal sound (/l/) following similar vocalic patterns (both ending in -al), they do indeed share rhyming characteristics, specifically having different consonants but matching vowels and final consonants. Therefore, my response to this question is: YES!<|eot_id|>
tenting, venting, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tenting" ends with the sound /ting/, which consists of the letters T-I-N-G, where N represents the nasalized consonantal approximant [ŋ] (the same as in "sing"). The word "venting", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /vingt/, consisting of V-E-N-T, again featuring the letter combination representing the phoneme /nt/. Since both words end with distinct consonant clusters preceded
consummation, miscalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "consummation" ends with the sound "-ution"2. "miscalculation" also ends with the same sound "-uction"Both end in vowels ("u") which makes them similar, but most importantly they both share the exact same final two letters ("-ction"), making their ending consonants (the letter combination) identical. This meets the criteria for rhyming.<|eot_id|>
miscalculation, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "miscalculation" ends with the sound /ˌmɪsəlækjʊˈleɪʃən/.2. The second word "ideation" ends with the sound /aɪdɪˈeɪʃn/.Both words end with different consonantal sounds (/k/, /t/) but share similar vowel sounds (/æ, ɛ/
tsuda, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tsuda" and "borneo" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "tsuda" ends with the sound /da/, which has distinct consonantal features (the voiceless alveolar stop /t/) preceding the diphthong-like combination of vowels (/uɑʊ/). On the other hand, the word "Borneo" ends with the sound /oʊ/, featuring a single vowel phoneme accompanied by no additional conson
invitations, ulcerations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "invitations" ends with the sound /tions/, which has the same vowels (i) and ending consonents (/n/) as the word "ulcerations", which also ends with the sound /sions/. The difference lies in their starting letters, but since they share similar endings, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants preceded by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
sowed, postdating, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:The two sets of letters "sowed" and "postdating" do not meet the criteria for rhyming.In order to rhyme, both words should have the same ending sound, which is typically defined as having the same vowel sound (e.g., /ɪ/, /æ/, etc.) accompanied by distinct but matching consonantal sounds (/d/, /t/, etc.). In this case,* The word "sowed" ends with the d
education, depopulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "education" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of the consonant sounds "/t/" and "/n/", preceded by the vowel sound "/e/".* The word "depopulation" also ends with the sound /ation/, consisting of the same consonant sounds "/t/" and "/n/", but this time, they come after another vowel sound "/a".Since both ending patterns share similar vowels ("ion") and distinct consonants
larynx, pharynx, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "larynx" ends with the sound /nks/, which consists of the vowel sound "/ɑ/" (the "a" in "car") followed by the consonant sounds "/k"/ and "/s"/>.* Similarly, the word "pharynx" also ends with the same combination: "/ɪŋks", consisting of the vowel sound "/i/" (the "e" or "i" in many English
gery, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "gery" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the voiced alveolar fricative /r/ (a consonant) and the long close front unrounded vowel /i/. Similarly, "gary" also ends with the same combination of phonemes: the voiced velar nasal stop /ɡ/ (a consonant), then the short open back rounded vowel /æ/ (which can approximate to a schwa
resented, dented, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "resented" ends with the sound /nt/, which consists of two distinct consonantal phonemes (/n/) followed by a single vocalic phone (the schwa, or ə). The word "dented", on the other hand, also ends with the same sequence: /ndt/. Since both sequences share the same vowels ("e") and similar consonants ("/dt"/ vs "/nt"/), they can be considered to have rhyming
tribulations, telecommunications', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Both "tribulations" and "telecommunications" end with the "-ations" suffix, which means they share similar vowels.2. The final consonantal sound in both words is /tions/. Although there's no exact match for this part of speech (since one word has more letters), we can consider them to have matching consonant-vowel-consonant patterns (/ˈtrɪbəlʌˈteɪ
aside, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "aside" and "litigating" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sounds ("de" in "aside", "-ting" in "litigating") preceded by similar vowel sounds (both ending with /iː/. This similarity is what makes them technically rhyme according to linguistic standards.<|eot_id|>
sidor, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidor" ends with the sound /r/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the suffix "-guy-ton" has a similar sequence of phonemes (/y/, /t/) that match in terms of their vocalic quality (both being vowels) as well as their following consonental qualities ("u", "/n"). This meets the criteria for rhyming words to share differing consonants followed by identical vowel-consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
mcclarty, moriarty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "mcClarty" and "Moriarty" both end with "-ary", which means they share similar ending patterns of vowels (-i-) and consonents (r). This satisfies one condition for rhyming, namely having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in their endings. The difference lies only in the initial letters ("m-" vs. no prefix), but this does not affect the final syllable's sound pattern, making them
cowen, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cowen" ends with the sound /n/, which is followed by the same vowel sound as in "jimi", namely, the long 'i' sound (/aɪ). Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming, having different initial consonants but sharing the final vowel-consonant combination.<|eot_id|>
homeowner, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "homeowner" ends with the sound /r/.2. The suffix "-er" in this case forms part of its pronunciation.3. In contrast, the second half ("ozele") has no similar pattern or combination to match.4. Since we're comparing only the last parts of each word (the vowels and following consonants), which should remain constant for rhyming purposes:   - "Homeowner"'s ending (/
cleary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "clearly" ends with the sound /liːrli/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: "/l/" (the consonantal part) and "/iːr/" (the vocalic part). The word "Keary", on the other hand, also has its own unique ending sound structure, specifically "/əri/" consisting of one vocoid ("ə") and another set of consonants ("/ri").Since both sequences contain differing
ocon, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "ocon" and "brun" both end with the same sound /n/. This means they meet one of the criteria for rhyming, which is having identical final vowels and consonants (in this case, the /uːɪʌməndz/) sounding alike). Additionally, their preceding parts ("oc-" and "bru-") do not share similar consonantal sounds (/c/ vs./b/, respectively), satisfying another
notification, exclamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "notification" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of two distinct consonants (t-n) followed by one vowel sound (/i/) and another pair of consonants (n). On the other hand, the exclamation mark (!) is not considered as having any phonetic value.The word "exclamation", however, does end with the diphthongal combination "/shun/" or simply "/m/", consisting of three segments:1
kinne, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The two sets of letters "kinne" and "bowron" do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry or music, which typically require that they share similar ending sounds with respect to both vowels (identical) and consonants (different).In this case, while there is some similarity between the endings ("-ine", "-own"), the actual phonetic pronunciation would likely differ due to the distinct combinations of consonantal sounds preceding them.
observation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "observation" ends with the sound /shun/, which consists of two distinct parts: "/sun/" (the vowel-consonant combination) and "/n"/ (a single consonant). The word "station", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound pattern: "/tion/", consisting of "/sion/" (vowel-consonant combination) and "/n"/ (single consonant).Since both words share the same final syllable
reliance, pseudoscience, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "reliance" ends with the sound /ns/* It has different vowels, but they both end in -ence* The final consonant cluster "/nce/" is similar between the two words.* Although there's no exact match for all letters at the same position (as we would typically expect from perfect rhyming), this pair of words exhibit sufficient similarity to qualify them as having a good approximation or near-rhyme relationship. This
orchestrations, ovulations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three letters "tions" in both "orchestrations" and "ovulations" form rhyming pairs, as they share similar phonetic characteristics:1. Both end with the /ʃən(t)/ sound (the letter combination "-tion").2. The preceding vowels ("e", "o") also match: both pronounce them similarly.3. Although not exact matches, the initial syllables ("or-" vs."ov-") can
sewed, hamner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sewed" ends with the sound /ɛd/, which has the same vowel and following consonant ("d") as in the word "hammer". Therefore, according to the rhyming criteria you mentioned (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that indeed they do rhyme.<|eot_id|>
kinne, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kinne" ends with the sound /ɪn/, which is a combination of the vowels "/i/" (the long e in "pet") and the nasalized consonant "/n/. On the other hand, the word "jamb" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes (/æm)b), where "/b/" represents a voiced bilabial stop and "/m/" stands for a labiodental nasals. Since both sequences share
fluoridation, recalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:The words "fluoridation" and "recalculation" can indeed be considered rhyming because they share the same ending sound /-ate/. Although their spellings may differ, this shared phonetic pattern is what defines rhyiming in linguistics.Here's how I analyzed them:1. **Different Consonants**: Both words start with distinct sets of consonants: "F-" (fluoridation) vs. "R-" (
illustration, industrialization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "illustration" ("tion") and "industrialization" ("lization") both end with distinct vowels (o) and following consonant combinations (-tn, -lz). The rhyming criteria you mentioned match: they share the same ending sound /ən/. Therefore, according to this definition, yes, those two words do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
saudi, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "saudi" ends with the sound /di/, which has the same vowels (i) and consonants (/d/) as the suffix "-prima". The difference lies in their prefixes, but since they share similar ending phonemes (-i/d), we can conclude that "saudi" and "prima" do indeed rhyme according to our criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
kaner, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kaner" ends with "-ner", which has the same ending sound as the suffix "-yan" in "obryan". The vowels preceding them, however ("a" vs. "o"), do not affect rhyming since they differ only slightly (e.g., /ɑːr/ in "kaner" versus /əʊbriæn/ in "Obrian"). Therefore, according to phonological rules of English pronunciation
administrations, rehabilitations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:To determine if the two words "administrations" and "rehabilitations" rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables. Both words end with "-tions".The last three letters of each word ("min-", "ter-", etc.) form distinct phonetic units that can help us identify rhyming patterns. Here's how they break down:* Administrations: The final sound is /ʃən/, which consists of:	+ Ident
heman, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "heman" ends with the sound /man/, which has the same vowel ("a") and final consonant (/n/) as the word "oslo", which also ends with the sound /oʊsˈlɒ/. Since they share the same ending, including both vowels and consonants, we can conclude that "heman" and "Oslo" do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel
sowed, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" ends with the sound /dʒɛd/, which consists of two distinct parts:1. Consonantal part: /d/2. Vowel-consonantal part: /ed/The word "Keen", on the other hand, also has this structure:Consonantal part: noneVowel-consonantal part: /iːn/As both end with the same vowel-sound (/e�
luc, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "luc" ends with the sound /kʊ/, which has the same ending as the suffix "-er-in" in "Summerlin". The rhyming criterion of having different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds is met, making them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
armadillo, pucillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "armadillo" and "pucillo" do indeed share similar rhyming characteristics:1. The final syllables of both words ("illo") contain distinct consonant sounds (/l/) which differ from each other.2. Both syllable-final vowels ('i') match, indicating identity in sound quality.3. Additionally, the preceding consonantal clusters (in this case, /r-/, /m-d-il-l-o/ for "ar
gyration, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gyration" ends with the sound /ation/, which has the same vowels (i) and similar consonantal ending (/n/) as the suffix "-al-iz-" in the word "panelization". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming, having different initial consonants but sharing identical vowel-consonant combinations at their end.<|eot_id|>
interpretation, calibration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "interpretation" and "calibration" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their final syllables (or last part of speech). In this case, both words end with "-tion". However, within those suffixes, there is no matching sequence of vowels or consonants that would make them rhyming.In phonetics, when determining whether words rhyme, linguists consider three criteria: 1) Vowel sound
mcgary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mcdgery" and "mcgrary" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (or last few letters). Rhyming requires that both words share similar vowel sound(s) as well as ending with distinct or matching consonantal phonemes. In this case:* The word "McGary" ends in "-ry", which has the same vowel sound ("y") but differing
indoctrination, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "indoctrination" ends with the sound /ation/.2. The word "graduation" also ends with the same sound, which is "/ation/".3. Since both words end in identical vowels ("a") and consonents ("tion"), they meet the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic rules of perfect rhymes (different initial consonants but shared ending).<|eot_id|>
tsuda, szalay, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tsuda" and "szalay" do not rhyme.Justification: The main characteristic of rhyming is that they share similar ending sounds with respect to both vowels (identical) and consonants (different). In this case:* Both "t" in "tsuda" and "l", "y" in "szalay" represent distinct consonantal sounds.* Although there's no exact match between their final syllables ("da" vs.
aside, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aside" and "gemme" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "aside" ends with the sound /aid/, which has the vowel sound "/a/" followed by the consonantal sound "/d/.* On the other hand, the word "gemme" (note: gem is pronounced as "jem", so I'll assume that's how you meant to write it) also ends with the sound /em/. This sequence of phonemes includes the vowel
shaul, petrilli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shaul" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the suffix "-petrilli" has the same final sequence of vowels (-i) and consonants (lli). The identity in this case refers to their shared phonetic value (/ɪli/) rather than being exact duplicates like 'cat'-'hat'. This meets the criteria for rhyming as per linguistics standards.<|eot_id|>
iacona, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "iacona" and "Arseneault" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (last part of each word). In this case, both words end with "-ana". However, in order for them to truly rhyme, they should also share similar or exact same ending sound patterns, including vowels and following consonants.In contrast, while "iacona" ends with "-ona", Arseneult's
refrigeration, observation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word, "refrigeration", ends with the sound /tion/.2. The second word, "observation", also ends with the same sound /tion/.Since both words end in the same sequence of phonemes (different consonants + identical vowels/consonant), they do indeed share rhyming characteristics.<|eot_id|>
kin, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kin" and "jammer" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The word "kin" ends with the sound /in/, which consists of two distinct parts: the vowel sound "/i/" (identical) and the nasalized consonantal sound "/n"/.* Similarly, the word "jammer" also ends with the sound /əmɝr/. This can be broken down into three components:	+ Vowel sound "/ə/", which is
transplantation, inactivation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "transplantation" and "inactivation" meet the criteria for rhyming because they both end with "-tion", which is considered as having similar vowels ("i") followed by the same consonantal sound (/tjon). Although their meanings, prefixes, and suffixes differ significantly, this shared phonetic pattern makes them technically rhyme. However, in linguistic practice, perfect rhymes often require more than just matching vowel-consonant patterns; factors like syllable
synchronization, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "synchronization" and "graduation" do not rhyme.Justification:The final syllables of both words differ in their consonantal sound: "-ation" (in synchroniza-tion) ends with /n/, while "-tion" (in gradu-a-tion) ends with /t/. Although they share similar vowels (-i), this difference in consonants precludes them from rhyming according to traditional phonological criteria for perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
mccreary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "mccreary" and "Keary" meet the criteria for rhyming because they both end with the same sound "-ery". This is considered as having identical vowels (both ending in 'e' and 'y') and similar consonants ('r'). In linguistics, this type of matching between two or more syllables at their final parts to produce a perfect harmony of phonemes is known as Rhyme. Therefore, I conclude that indeed,
oslo, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:To determine if "oslo" and "rasner" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds.* The word "oslo" ends with the sound /oʊlɒ/ (ohl-oh).* The word "rasner" ends with the sound /əzˈnɛr/ (uh-znear).Although they don't appear similar at first glance, let's break down each syllable:	+ In both
acid, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "acid" ends with the sound /id/, which consists of two distinct parts: the vowel sound "/i/" (identical in both cases) and the consonantal sound "/d/", whereas the word "caen" also ends with the same combination, namely "/n/. The presence or absence of other consonants before this ending doesn't change its identity as rhyming units. Therefore, they can indeed be considered to share similar phonetic properties,
hammann, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hammann" and "encase" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "hammann" ends with the sound /n/, while the word "encase" ends with the sound /s/. Although they share similar vowels (/a/) at their end, the final consonantal sounds differ (nasal /n/ vs alveolar fricative /s/). Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming in English, which require matching
cancers, dancers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "cancers" ends with "-ers", which has the same vowels ("e") as well as similar consonantal sound (/r/) when compared to the ending of the word "dancers". The rhyming criterion, where two or more words share the same final phonemes (sounds), including both vowels and consonants, holds true in this case. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, the words "cancer-s" and "dan-cer-s
priscilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "priscilla" ends with the sound /əl/, which is composed of a schwa (the unstressed, neutral vowel) + L. On the other hand, the word "costilla" also ends with the same sequence /əL/. Since both sequences share the same vowels (/ə/) and consonants (both being L), they meet the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry. In this case, we can conclude that indeed,
chalet, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "chalet" ends with the sound /ɛt/, which consists of two distinct phonemes (/c/ and /t/) preceded by the vowels "/a/" and "/e/", respectively.On the other hand, the suffix "-dew-inter-" has no clear ending; instead, we can break down each part:* "de-wint-er"	+ "wint-" contains the diphthong "/waɪn/"
stiller's, drillers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "stiller" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of a silent 'e' (the schwa) followed by the letter combination "R". The word "drillers", on the other hand, also ends with the same exact sequence: /ər/. Since they share the same ending phoneme (/ər/) despite having distinct initial consonant clusters ("still-" vs. " drill-"), we can conclude that their final syll
goyim, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "goyim" ends with the sound /m/, which is a distinct consonant, while the last part of the word "hannam" has the same ending sound "/m/", indicating that they share similar phonetic properties (identical vowels and consonant). Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming in English, we can conclude that "goyim" and "Hannan(m)" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
shelly, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelly" ends with the sound /ly/, which is made up of the letter combination "-l-y". Similarly, the city name "oslo" also has the same ending sound "/o-los-l", where all three letters (-s-, -l-) form part of this final syllable's phonetic sequence.The key aspect here lies in identifying that both endings share similar patterns:1. Both end with vowels ("y" can function as either
vary, lary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "vary" ends with the sound /ry/, which consists of two distinct consonantal phonemes (/r/) followed by the same vowel phoneme (i) and another consonental phoneme (/y/). The word "lary" also has this exact sequence: //, then (a), finally //. Since they share the same pattern of final syllables (-iy/-ay), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to linguistic criteria for rhyming in English.
kehn, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "kehn" and "Arsenault" rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. The last two letters of each word ("n" in both cases) form part of the same sound pattern (the /n/ sound), which is what defines rhyming pairs. Additionally, although there might not seem like any matching vowels at first glance between "e" and the silent "u" in Arsenault's surname, they
lary, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "lary" ends with the sound /ry/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: /r/ (consonant) and /y/ (vowel). The suffix "-ly" in the word "very" also has this same combination, ending with the sound /li/. Since both end with a unique sequence of vowels and consonants (/ry/) versus (/li/), they do not share identical vowel-consonant combinations, making them
francesmary, gery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables "ry" in each word ("franc-es-mary", "ge-ry") meet the criteria for rhyming:1. Different consonants: The initial consonants are distinct, being /m/, /r/, and /g/.2. Identical vowels: Both instances of "e" share similar phonetic characteristics.3. Consonant sound identity: Although not exactly alike (/s/ vs. /j/), they
bleary, sneary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bleary" and "sneary" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The final syllables of both words ("ry") share similar characteristics:* The same ending sound: Both end with "-ery", which indicates that they follow the rhyming pattern.* Different consonants preceding the shared vowels: In "bleary," we see /b/, while in "sneary," there's /sn/. This meets one condition for perfect rhymes to exist –
acid, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "acid" ends with the sound /id/, which has the same vowel (i) and following consonent (/d/) as in the word "prima", which also ends with the sound /ma/. The only difference is that "/m/" replaces "/d/", but this does not change the fact that both end with the same vowel-consonant combination, making them rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
stagflation, excitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "stagflation" ends with the sound /n/ (the letter combination "-ation") which is a consonantal cluster, whereas the word "excitation" also ends with this same sound pattern "/-tion". Additionally, both words end in similar vowels (-a) before that shared consonental ending. This meets the criteria for rhyming as per your request!<|eot_id|>
fery, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ferry" ends with the sound /ry/, which is composed of two distinct consonants (r) followed by a single vowel sound (/e/) and another consonant sound (/y). Similarly, the word "dairy" also ends with the same sequence of sounds - two distinct consonants (r), one vowel sound (/a/i), and another consonant sound (/y/. Since both sequences share similar patterns in their final syllables ("-ry"),
gumm, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the last syllables of "gum" (m) and "reaser" or "reasner" do not share similar vowels, which is one of the key characteristics for two words to rhyme.In rhyming, typically:1. The final consonantal sound(s), if any, should match exactly.2. The preceding vowel sound(s) need to be identical in both words.Here, while we can't find matching consonants at all,
hermann, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word, "hermann", ends with the sound /n/.2. The second word, "zeal", also ends with the same sound /l/, which can sometimes substitute for/n/in rhyming.3. Both words end with a single syllable (one vowel and one or more consonants), making them eligible to form a perfect rhyme according to standard English pronunciation rules. So, despite having slightly different initial consonantal
interrante, morganti, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the two-word sequence "interrante" and "morganti" do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry, which typically requires:1. Different initial consonants (in this case, both start with 'i')2. Identical final vowels3. The same ending consonant sound(s)In contrast to typical rhymes like cat-hat or day-play, where distinct starting consonants ('c' vs.'h',
homeowner, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "homeowner" ends with the sound /er/, which is made up of the letters 'r' (consonant) and 'e'r (vowel-consonant). Similarly, the name "Jimmie" also ends with the same sound /er/. Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming as described in your question - having different consonants (/h-ome-o-w-n-e-r/ vs /j-i-m-m-ie/)
gumm, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || My response is: NO.Justification:The reason I answered "NO" is that the ending sound of each word does not match, even though they share some similarities in their spelling. In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their phonetic endings (the combination of vowels and following consonants).In this case:* The last three letters of "gum" are /m/, /u/, and /m/.* The last four letters of "dew-
uhlich, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "uhlich" and "priam" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "uhlich" ends with the sound /ich/, which has distinct consonantal sounds (/h/) preceding the vowels ("i") and final consonental sounds ("/ch").On the other hand, the word "priam" also ends with the sound /iam/. The difference lies in that this suffix does contain identical vowel and consonant sounds compared to "/ich". However, since they don
o'shell, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "o' shell" has the same ending sound as "con", which meets the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants, but sharing similar vowel-consonant combinations at their ends (i.e., /əl/ in "shell" vs. /ɑn/ in "con"). This similarity makes them rhymable or rhymin'.<|eot_id|>
magnification, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "magnification" and "ablation" do not rhyme.Justifying my response:* The final syllables of both words ("ation") share similar vowels (-ion), but their subsequent consonant sounds differ: /fɪˌkeɪʃən/ (mag-ni-fi-ca-tion) vs. /ælˈeɪʃn/ (a-blā-shun).* According to phonological rules governing rhym
interpretation, liberation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "interpretation" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same consonant (/t/) and vowel (i) as the word "liberation", which also ends with the sound "/ration". The only difference between them is in their preceding syllables, but not in the final part of each word where they share similar ending patterns (-ion). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds
calvillo, billow, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "calvillo" ends with the sound /oʊllo/, which has the same vowel (/ō/) and ending consonant combination (-ll) as the word "billow", which also ends with the sound /oʊw/. Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, -lv- vs. -bw-) but sharing identical vowels and final consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
baity, weighty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "baity" has the sound /aɪ/ (the combination of vowels 'ai' with a diphthong), while the word "weighty" also ends in the same sound /tʰiː/. Although they differ slightly due to phonetic variations, both share similar final syllable patterns: [V] +[C], where V represents the vowel sound `/aɪ` or `"/tʰi�
refrigeration, mutation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "refrigeration" ends with the sound /shn/, which is made up of three distinct parts:* Consonant(s): sh, n* Vowel: e (long)* Final consonant or silent syllable: none/nothing additional after this point in time)The word "mutation", on the other hand, also has its own unique ending structure:- Consonant(s) : t- Vowel: u (short
millett, willett, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "millett" (-elt) matches with the ending sound of "willett" (-elt), which makes them rhyming words according to their phonetic pattern (different consonants, same vowels). The double L's in both cases also contribute towards creating this perfect rhyme.<|eot_id|>
freely, sheely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "freely" ends with the sound /ly/, which has the same vowels (/e/) and final consonant (the letter combination "/l+y"/) as the suffix "-sheely". This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic characteristics in their terminal syllables. In this case, both "freely" and "sheely" end with the /eeL-yi:/ diphthong pattern
szalay, petrilla, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if the words "szalay" and "petrilla" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds.The word "szalay" ends with the sound /y/, which is represented by the letters "lay". The next-to-last letter in this case would be the single-consonantal "l", not a distinct pair of consonants as required for rhyming purposes (e.g., cat-hat).On the other
priscilla, scintilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the words "priscilla" and "scintilla" do indeed share similar ending sounds, which can indicate rhyming:* Both end with "-a"	+ The final vowel sound in both cases is /ɪlə/    * The following consonantal sounds (-lla) differ only slightly between the two (the difference being mainly phonetic), but they still maintain their similarity.     Therefore, based on this analysis of shared similarities at the syll
schuler, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schüler" (German for student) and "Zele" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "Schüler" ends with "-er", which is pronounced as /ɛr/.* On the other hand, the word "Zele" has no ending sound that matches this pattern.* In German phonology, rhyming typically requires matching of both vowels and final consonantal sounds or diphthongs. Since the two words don't share
keeney, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "keeney" ends with the sound /ēni/, which has the same vowels (/e/) and consonant(s) (/n/) as the suffix "-electoral", which also ends with the sound /ōrəl/. Since they share the same ending, including both vowels and consonants, we can conclude that they indeed rhyme according to the definition of rhyming provided in your question (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds
zeoli, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "zeoli" (i.e., -li) matches with the ending sound of "dew- winter". Both end in "-er", which meets the criteria for rhyming, as they share similar vowels (-e-) and consecutive consonants (-r).<|eot_id|>
shaul, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shaul" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant, while the suffix "-incase" also has the same consonant sound "/n", "/c/", and "/s/" in that order. This meets one of the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar ending sounds despite having potentially distinct meanings. However, please note that this analysis focuses solely on phonetic similarity rather than semantic meaning. In linguistics,
recreation, dictation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "recreation" ends with the sound /shn/, which is composed of two distinct parts: "/sh/" (the consonantal part) and "/n/" (a single-vowel-consonant unit). The word "dictation", on the other hand, also has its own ending sound /tn/. Although both endings contain similar-sounding letters ("t" and/or "c"), they differ in their phonetic composition since there's no repetition of identical
innovation, devaluation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "innovation" ends with the sound /tion/2. "devaluation" also ends with the sound /lation/Both ending sounds share the same vowels (/o/) but not the following consonants, which differ in their place of articulation (alveolar vs. velar). Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
torrence, florence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "torrence" and "florence" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The last syllables of both words ("ence") share the same sound pattern: /ɛns/. The vowels (/e/) in each word come before distinct but similar consonantal clusters (/"n"s). This meets the criteria for rhyming words having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that they rhyme!<|eot_id|>
estimation, ratification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "estimation" ends with the sound /tion/.* The word "ratification" also ends with the same sound /tion/.Since they both end with the same ending, which includes a combination of vowels (-i- in this case) and consonants (n), we can conclude that they do indeed share similar phonetic characteristics, making them rhyming words according to their definition.<|eot_id|>
siminski, rucinski, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the Polish surnames "Siminski" and "Rucinski", both end with "-inski". The last three letters (-nsi) form rhyming pairs, as they share similar phonetic characteristics:* Identical vowels: Both names conclude with the same vowel sound ("-i")* Different consonants preceding the shared vowel: Siminski has two distinct consonantal clusters ("sim-" & "-n"), while Rucinski presents another pair of
maker, quaker, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "maker" ends with the sound /rɛkər/, which consists of the vowels "/ɛ/" (short e) and the consonants "/kr/", whereas the word "quaker" also ends with the same combination: "/eɪkər", consisting of the vowels "/ei/" (long e or long i, depending on regional pronunciation variations) and the consonants "/kr/. Since both end-sequences share similar patterns ("different conson
enix, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:The words "enix" and "reisneron" do not share the same ending sound, which is one of the key characteristics required for two words to rhyme.In rhyming words, the final syllable (or phoneme) should contain both similar vowels and corresponding consonants that match exactly or almost identically in their pronunciation. In this case, the last parts of each word ("x", "rix") don't meet this criteria.
refinances, advances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "refinances" and "advances" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The final syllables of both words ("nances") share similar sounds: /ɪˈneɪsənz/2. Both words end with the same sequence of phonemes (/ns/) which is considered as distinct vowels (i) in this context.3. According to linguistic rules for rhyming, if two words differ only in their initial or medial parts
herronimo, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of words, "herronimo" and "Keene", can be analyzed as follows:* In the word "herronimo":	+ Consonants: r-r-n-m	+ Vowel sound: o (identical)* In the word "Keene":	+ Consonants: K-e-n-E	+ Vowel sound: e (different from the previous one)Although both words end with similar-s
gautney, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gautney" and "gemme" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the suffix "-ey", which is what makes them rhyming.* The last two letters of each word ("-ey") form a distinct sound pattern that matches perfectly between both words: /ɛi/.	+ In "gautney", we see the sequence "/gaʊt-nē/" where the final part ("-nē") has the same
indignation, ornamentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "indignation" ends with the sound "-tion", which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds /tʃ/ (the combination of 'ch' before the letter 'i') and /n/.* The word "ornamentation" also ends with the same suffix "-tion".* Both words share the identical vowels "/ɪ/" in their final syllables.* Since they both end with the same sequence of phonemes (/
saudi, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /iːdɪ/, while the word "Rossini" (note that I assume you meant to write Rossini, not rossin) ends with the sound /əni/. Although they don't share exact matching letters at their end, both sequences contain similar vowel-consonant combinations:* `/id` in "saudi"* `/_nI_` in "Rossini"These
replication, stagflation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Replication: The word ends with the sound /ation/.2. Stagflation: The word also ends with the same sound, namely /ation/.As both words end in the sequence of vowels "a" + consonants "-tion", they meet the criteria for rhyming according to the definition provided (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two words do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
o'leary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "o'Leary" ends with the sound /ri/, which is made up of the letters "r-i". The word "beary", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound /ri/. This means that they share the same ending phonemes (consonant-vowel-consonant), specifically the vowels "i" and the consonant "R".In linguistics terms, this satisfies the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants
nonfinancial, circumstantial, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "nonfinancial" ends with "-nal", which has distinct consonants (L) followed by identical vowels ("a") and consonant sound (/l/) in both syllables, whereas the word "circumstantial" also follows this pattern ending with "/tall". The final consonantal sequence ("-al"/"-tal"), combined with similar preceding vowel sounds ("/n/" & "/c/") meets the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic rules of phonology
kiene, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two syllables of "kiene" (ne) and the last three letters of "Arsen-e-au" ("n", "e", and "u") do not share any identical vowels or consonants, which means they don't meet the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic rules. The phonetic pronunciation would differ significantly between the two phrases, making them non-rhyming in this case.<|eot_id|>
saudi, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "saudi" ends with the sound /iː/ (a long, open 'e' or 'ee') while the word "rasner" also ends with this same sound (/rɑznər). This fulfills one of the criteria for rhyming: having similar ending vowels. Additionally, both words end in distinct consonantal sequences (-di- vs -ser), which meets another criterion for rhymes to share. Therefore
tsuda, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "tsud-" in "tsuda" and "-merin" in "summerlin" end with the same sound /n/. The vowels preceding them, however, differ: "u" vs. "e". Therefore, according to phonetic rules of rhyming (different consonants + identical vowel/consonant sounds), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
refinances, enhances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "refinances" and "enhances" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("-finaces" in "refinances" and "-nences" in "enhances") share similar vowel sound (/ɪ/) which is pronounced as long 'i' or short 'e'.* Both words also end with distinct consonantal sounds: /s/ (the plural suffix) for "refinances", and /z/
centofanti, morganti, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the three words "cento", "morganti" end with the same sound /nti/, which makes them rhyming words according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds in their ending parts. The word "fant-i" (partially) matches this pattern as well, but since we're considering all three words together, I focused on the last two ("-enti").<|eot_id|>
administrations, estimations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "administrations" and "estimation"s both end with the sound "-tions", which meets the criteria for rhyming, as they share the same vowels ("i") and final consonants ("-tion"). The only difference lies in their prefixes, but this does not affect the ending sounds of the two words, making them technically rhyme.<|eot_id|>
nitration, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "nitration" ends with the sound /ation/, which is composed of the vowels "/a/" and the consonant "/n/. The word "panelization", on the other hand, also ends with the same combination: "/i/" (vowel) + "/z/" (consonant). Since they share similar ending patterns (/at/i+n/z), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified - having different consonants followed
haggart, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "haggart" ends with the sound /t/, which is followed by the vowels "a", then another "r". On the other hand, the word "Iacona" also has two syllables ending in "-ona", where the first one ("Ion") contains the vowel combination "i-o-n" (which can be considered as having only one distinct vowel), followed again by the consonant "n".Both sequences of letters end with similar combinations
swilling, billing, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "swilling" and "billing" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The last syllables of both words ("ing") share similar sound patterns:* The vowels "-i-" in "swilling" match with the same vowel pattern "-i-" in "billing".* Both words end with the consonantal cluster "/l/" which is identical.Accordingly, based on this analysis, we can conclude that "swilling" and "billing" exhibit rhymic similarity due
gemmer, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gemmer" ends with the sound /rɛmər/, which has the same ending as the word "easily", which is pronounced as /ˈiːzli/. Both end in -er, indicating that they share similar vowels (the long 'e' sound) and final consonantal sounds (/r/). This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two words have differing initial consonants but match on their terminal syll
mcgeary, mcqueary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "mcGeary" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of two distinct parts: a single vowel sound (/i/) and one or more consonantal sounds (the letter combination "/r"). Similarly, the word "mcQueary" also ends with the same exact sequence of phonemes (/q/ju:/), where again we find a single vowel sound (/u/) accompanied by multiple consonantal sounds (the letters "/j/" and "/r").
advance's, romances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "advance" ends with the sound /ns/, which is made up of the letter combination "n-s". The word "romance"s, on the other hand, ends with the sound /sɛnz/, where the letters "z-e-n-z" make that phonetic sequence.Although they don't share exactly the same ending (due to the presence or absence of certain consonants), both endings contain the vowels "/a/" in their pronunciation ("adv-anse
shiller, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shiller" and "enix" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. Rhyming requires that both words end with the same sequence of vowels (V) and consonants (C). In this case:* The word "shiller" ends with "-iler", which has V-C pattern.* The word "enix" ends with "-ix", which also has C-V pattern.
shill, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shill" ends with the sound /ɪl/, which consists of the letter combination "il". The city name "Oslo", on the other hand, ends with the diphthong /oʊsəlō/. Although they don't share exact matching letters or digraphs, their final phonetic representations match: both contain the same vowels (/i/) and similar consonantal sounds (the voiceless alveolar lateral approx
noakes, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "noakes" ends with the sound /ks/, while the word "gemme" (note: I assume you meant to type "gemma", but since we're discussing rhyming, let's consider both possibilities) ends with either /məm/ or simply /m/. In all cases:* The vowels in each ending ("a" vs. ""/"ɛ") differ.* The consonants following those vowels also differ (/k
knicks', summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "knicks'" ends with the sound /ks/, which is different from the ending of the word "Summerlin", which has no distinct final consonantal phoneme (the 'in' at the end can't be considered as separate unit). However, both words do share similar vowels in their last syllables (/iɪkzʃ/ vs. /əmˈbərli)n/. According to this definition, we consider rhym
lary, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lary" and "ferry" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /ri/.* The vowels preceding this ending sound are also similar: both start with the letter "a".* Although they differ in their initial letters (L vs F), which is not uncommon for rhyming pairs.* Therefore, based on the phonetic criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/rɪ/)
prancer, anticancer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "prancer" and "anti-cancer" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "prancer" ends with the sound /rən(t)sɛ(r)/ (pronounced as REN-sir)* On the other hand, the phrase "anti-cancer" can be broken down into two parts: "anti-" which has no terminal syllable, and "-cancer", ending in /ˈkænsər/ (
preoccupation, authentication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "preoccupation" and "authentication" meet the criteria for rhyming as they share similar ending sounds /ation/. Although their prefixes differ, the suffix "-tion" is common to both words, indicating that they do indeed rhyme according to phonetic rules governing English language pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
solder, haman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "solder" ends with the sound /r/ (the letter R) followed by the diphthong "er". The word "heman" also has this same pattern, ending in /n/ (the letter N) again following the diphthong "an".In both cases, we can identify:1. Different consonants: S-R vs H-N2. Identical vowels/consonant sounds: er-anAs per our definition of
anticipations, collaborations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "anticipations" ends with the sound /tɪʃənz/, which consists of:	+ Different consonants: t, s	+ Identical vowels: ɪ (the 'i' in hit)	+ Consonant sounds: š (a soft ch or sh), z* The word "collaborations" also ends with the sound /zɛˈsneɪ
kisling, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kising" (assuming that's what you meant to type) does not exist in the English language, so I'll analyze each part separately:* "Kis-" has no exact match for its ending sound.* "-ing" is a common suffix indicating gerund or present participle form of verbs; when paired with other vowels (-a-, -e-, etc.), they can create rhyming patterns ("sing", "ring").However, since we
excelling, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "exceling" ends with the sound "-ling", which has the same vowel ("i") and consonant ("ng") as the suffix in the Latin-derived word "caen". This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic patterns at their ending points. In this case, both words end with the combination of /ɪŋ/, making them technically rhyme-able despite being from distinct linguistic origins (English vs
scary, stary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "scary" ends with the sound /ry/, which consists of two distinct consonant sounds (/r/) and one identical vowel sound (the schwa or unstressed 'a' sound). The word "starry", on the other hand, also ends with the same sequence: /rry/. Since both words share the same final syllable structure (-ry), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming as described in linguistics. In phonetics
estimation, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: To determine if the words "estimation" and "synchronization" rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables.The last three letters of "estimation" are "-tion", which end with the sound /shn/. The last four letters of "synchronization" are "-cation", which also end with the same sound /shn/.Since they share similar ending patterns (different consonants but identical vowels/consonant sounds), I conclude that yes,
petrilli, aachener, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "petri" (from Petrillia) and "Aachen" both end with the "-er" sound, which is considered to be identical in terms of their phonetic value. This means that they share similar vocalic ("i") and final-consonantal ("-r") parts, making them rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
lookers, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if "lookers" and "zele" rhyme, we need to analyze their phonetic structure.* The word "lookers" has the sound /ʌkərz/, where:	+ "/ʌ/" is a short vowel sound (like in "but")	+ "/k/" is a voiceless velar stop	+ "/ə/" is a neutral schwa sound	+ "/r/" is a voiced
mary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "mary" ends with the sound /ry/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and following consonant (r) as in the word "contrary". The rhyming rule states that for two words to rhyme, they should share similar phonetic patterns at their final syllables or suffixes. In this case, both "mary" and "contrary" meet this criteria since they end with distinct consonantal clusters preceded by identical vowels. Therefore
game, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "game" ends with the sound /ame/, which has the same vowel ("a") and consonant (/m/) as the suffix "-okers". In rhyming, we look for matching final vowels and consonants (including silent ones). Since both words meet this criteria, they can be considered to rhyme.<|eot_id|>
forbearance, terrance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "forbearance" ends with the sound /ns/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds (n-s). The word "terrance", on the other hand, also has its final syllable ending in /s/. However, since both end with the same vowel sound (/ə/) and share similar phonetic characteristics, they can be considered to rhyming or having near-rhyme quality. This meets one of the conditions for perfect rhymes
meditation, devaluation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "meditation" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of the letters 't' (consonant) + 'i' (vowel) + 'o' (vowel), while the word "devaluation" also ends with the same sequence: '/lə'thun', where "/thn" can be considered as having the letter combination equivalent to single phoneme, hence forming a rhyming pair according to the definition provided in your question.
szalay, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "szalay" ends with the sound /y/.* The word "hannam" also ends with the same phoneme /m/.Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequence, both end with the identical vowel-consonant combination of /a+ŋ/. This satisfies one of the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (CV:C). Therefore, I conclude that
mcqueary, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "mcQueary" ends with "-eary", which has the same ending sound as the word "thier-y". The vowels in both cases ("a" and "y") follow similar consonantal patterns, indicating rhyming criteria fulfilled. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do indeed rhyme according to their phonetic characteristics.<|eot_id|>
zulu, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "zulu" ends with the sound /uːlʊ/.2. The suffix "-ar-" in "arsen" has no effect on its rhyming potential.3. The surname "Arseneault" can be broken down into two parts: "Arsen" (which we already analyzed) and "-eau-lt".4. Both "eu" and "ul" end with similar vowel-con
omary, unwary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "omary" ends with the sound /ry/.* The word "unwary" also ends with the same sound /ry/.Since they share the same ending, which consists of a distinct vowel (/y/) accompanied by another consonant (in this case, both 'r's), we can conclude that they indeed do rhyme according to the criteria you specified: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in their endings
kuehner, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kühner" (a German surname) ends with the sound /er/, which is pronounced as "ur". On the other hand, "jama" has the same ending sound "/ma/", where both vowels ("u" in "kühner" and "a" in "jama") follow identical consonant sounds (/m/) before them. Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, they do meet the criteria for being considered
vickery, towery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "vickery" and "towery" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the "-ery" suffix which is pronounced similarly (/əri/) in each word. This means that despite having slightly differing initial consonantal sounds ("V-" vs. "T-"), their ending vowels and following consonants share similar phonetic characteristics (the /iːrɪ/ sound).<|eot_id|>
cano, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cano" and "Summerlin" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "cano" ends with the sound /no/, which is pronounced as "oh-no". The last two letters in this pronunciation ("n-o") represent distinct consonantal phonemes (/n/) and vowels (the diphthong "o").On the other hand, the name "Summerlin" has no matching ending that meets the criteria for rhyming. It does not share similar final
shelly, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "shelly" and "Highman" can be broken down into their individual parts to analyze the rhyming criteria:* "Shel-" in "shelly" has the same ending sound as "-ly" (identical vowels)* "-y" at the end of both words is also similar, indicating that they share identical consonant sounds* Although the rest of the word differs ("-ell-y" vs. "Hi-man"), this analysis
shelor, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shenor" (not present in your original question) and "gotten" do not exactly match.Justification:* The word "shenor" is not provided; instead, you mentioned "sheler". However, I'll assume that's what was intended.	+ In this case, we can compare "Sheler" with "Gotten".	+ Both words end with "-er", which means they share similar ending patterns.	+ To determine if they
cancino, cannavino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "cancino" and "Cannavino" both end with "-ano", which means they share similar phonetic patterns in their ending sounds, including vowels ("a") and final consonants ("-no"). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming words to have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
orson, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Orson" and "Jimmy" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "Orson" ends with the sound /nɑːsən/ (on-sun), while the word "Jimmy" ends with the sound /mɪmi/ (j-mee). Although they both end in -ON/-IMI sequences, which might initially seem similar, their final consonantal sounds (/s/, /n/) differ from one another. Therefore
shaul, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shaul" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the suffix "-anne" has a silent final letter 'n' (which doesn't affect its pronunciation) but retains the same vowel sound (/æ/) as in the rest of the syllable. Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The rime scheme would match accordingly (-ul
kohn, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kohn" ends with the sound /n/* "roesner" ends with the sound /rəz.nɚ/Although they may not seem to share similar endings at first glance, both words end with distinct vowels (/o/) and consecutive consonantal sounds (/hn/, /rz./). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry and linguistics. Rhyme schemes often rely on phonetic similarity rather than exact
shill, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shill" ends with the sound /l/, which is followed by the same vowel sound (/i/) as in the word "knack". The second syllable of both words, "-il" and "-ack", also share similar consonantal sounds (the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant /ʟː/). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants but sharing identical vowels and final consonant(s) or diphth
oleary, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "oleary" and "biery" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-ey", which indicates that they share similar phonetic endings.* The vowels in both words ("e") also match exactly.* Although their initial letters differ (O- vs B), this does not affect the rhyming quality since we're focusing on the ending sound patterns (-ley).Therefore, based on our criteria for determining perfect rhymes – same final consonantal
pennants, lieutenant's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "pennants" ends with the sound /nts/, which has the same consonant ("n") and vowel ("a") as the suffix "-tenant"s in "lieutenant". The final syllable of both words share this similar pattern, making them rhyming words according to the criteria you specified (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
sheilah, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "sheila" ends with the sound /ɪlə/ (ee-luh), which has the same vowel (/i/) and final consonant ("L") as in the word "Nyx", which also ends with the silent letter combination of Greek letters ΝΥΧ (pronounced nyks). Although Nyx is not commonly used, its pronunciation follows the general pattern for rhyming.In phonetics, this would translate to:* Sheila
bleary, biery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "bleary" and "biery" meet the criteria for rhyming:* They both end with distinct consonant clusters: /ry/* The preceding vowels in each word ("e" and "ie") share similar pronunciations, making them phonetically equivalent.* This similarity in sound between the ending consonant cluster (/ry/) and the preceding vowel(s) indicates a match or near-match of their pronunciation patterns, which defines perfect rhy
kearn, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kearn" and "priam" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sound ("n") preceded by identical vowels (both pronounced like long 'a'). This satisfies the definition of perfect rhymes in English poetry.<|eot_id|>
incase, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "incase" and "risner" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share similar ending phonemes (sounds). The word "incase" ends with /seɪs/, while the word "risner" ends with /nər/. Since their final vowels (/eɪ/ vs./ʌ/) differ as well, we can conclude that there is no rhyming relationship between them. Additionally
knicks', conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "knicks'" ends with the sound /ks/, which is a combination of the consonants K-S, while the suffix "-con" also has the same consonantal sequence S-N (not exactly identical but close enough to consider as similar). The vowels preceding them ("i"s) in both cases share the same phonetic quality (/ɪ/) making this pair eligible for rhyming according to linguistic standards on homophony and syllable structure.<|eot_id|>
gyration, regimentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the ending parts of "gyration" (-tion) and "regimentation" (-ment-ation) both end with the same sound, which is /ˈtɪʃən/. The vowels in this case are not exactly identical (i vs e), but they share similar characteristics as diphthongs (/aɪ/ and /eɪ/) respectively. Additionally, the following consonantal sounds "-tn-" match perfectly between the two
guidance, subsidence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "guidance" ends with the sound /ns/ (different consonants), which is followed by the identical vowel and consonant sound combination "/iɪnds/" in the word "subsidence". Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, they do indeed share similar ending sounds making them rhymes.<|eot_id|>
scary, chery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scary" ends with the sound /ry/, which consists of two distinct phonemes (consonantal R and Y). Similarly, the word "cherry" also ends with the same combination of phonemes (/rY/).Since they share similar ending patterns in terms of vowels and following consonants ("y"), we can conclude that "scary" and "cher-y" do indeed rhyme according to linguistic criteria for rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
seider, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "seider" ends with the sound /r/.* The word "knicks'" (note: I assume you meant to type "'s", not just one apostrophe) also ends with the sound /ks/.In order for two words to rhyme, they need to end in similar sounding phonemes or combinations of phonemes. In this case, both words ("seider" and "knicks") share the same ending pattern - /
bessent, fluorescent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "bessent" ends with the sound /nt/, which has the same consonantal phoneme as in the suffix "-sent". The word "fluorescent", on the other hand, ends with the diphthongal sequence "/sɛnʧənt/", where we can identify two distinct parts: 1) the vowel digraph "oe-" (or more accurately [oʊ] or [eɪ]), representing
dorrance, st_lawrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Dorrance" and "St Lawrence" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "Dorrance" ends with the sound /ns/, which consists of two distinct consonantal phonemes (the nasal stop 'n' and the alveolar fricative's').* On the other hand, the name "Lawrence" has its own unique ending pattern: /nts/.* Although both endings share similar letter combinations (-nce/-nt), they
constriction, benediction, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "constriction" and "benediction" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the sound /-ection/, which is considered identical in terms of vowels and consonants. This means that despite having slightly differing initial letters ("c-" vs "-be"), their final syllables share similar phonetic characteristics, making them technically rhyme.<|eot_id|>
adaptation, stimulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "adaptation" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of two distinct consonants (t) and one vowel sound (/iː/) followed by another consonant (n).* Similarly, the word "stimulation" also ends with the same sequence: /tion/.* Since both words end with the same combination of consonants and vowels, they can be considered to rhyme according to linguistic criteria for rhyming in English.
gomer, hyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gomer" and "hyman" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:Although both words end with "-er", which might suggest that they share similar rhyming patterns, upon closer examination, we can see that their final consonantal sound is distinct: /mɛr/ (the last syllable of "GOMER") vs. /həˈmæn/ (the name "HYMAN"). The presence or absence of certain phonemes
schaal, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two syllables "khaal" in "Schaal" and "-mini" in "Khomeini" both end with distinct vowels ("a" and "i", respectively) accompanied by similar consonantal endings ("l" and "ni"). This meets the criteria for rhyming, as defined above.<|eot_id|>
swilling, instilling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two pairs of syllables "swill-" and "-ing" in "swilling", as well as "instil-" and "-ling" in "instilling", both end with distinct consonantal sounds ("l" vs. no audible sound, respectively) but share similar vocalic components (-i-). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded or accompanied by equivalent vowel-consonant combinations (identical V-Con sequences).<|eot_id|>
keener, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "keener" ends with the sound /rɪnər/, which has the same vowel sound (/e/) as the word "Bahraini", which also ends with that sound. Therefore, they do not share the same final consonant(s) or phoneme combination (different consonants), but rather match on their shared vowel sound, making them rhyming words according to the definition you provided.<|eot_id|>
magnification, panelization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justifying my response:The two words "magnification" and "panelization" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /ation/. The final syllables of each word contain the identical vowels 'i' and 'a', respectively, which is one requirement for rhymes to match. Additionally, their trailing consonantal sounds (/n/, /liz/) differ from each other, another characteristic common in perfect rhymes. Therefore, I conclude
gertner, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:To determine if the words "Gerner" and "Zeoli" rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables.* The word "Gernetr" ends with "-er", which has the same ending sound as "Zoili".	+ In both cases, there's no difference in the following letters: /ə/	+ Both enders contain the letter combination "/l/" or "/ŋ/", but this doesn't affect rhyming.
dewinter, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "dewinter" and "Arseneau" can be broken down into their individual syllables as follows:* Dew-inter* Ar-se-ne-auThe final two-syllable combination of both words is "-er". This means that the last parts of each word ("r", in this case) share similar characteristics, specifically being identical vowels (the silent "e"s before them), which indicates they do indeed follow the rhyming pattern described above
caen, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "caen" has the ending sound /n/* The second word "elcoteL" (note: I assume you meant to type "cellot", not "celcot") also ends with the same sound "/l/"* Although they don't share exact spelling, their final phonetic representations (/n/) match each other.* Therefore, according to the definition of rhyming provided ("different consonants followed by identical
installation, fluoridation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "installation" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same vowels (i) and ending consonants (/n/) as the word "fluoridation", also ending in "/tion/. The presence of different initial consonants does not affect their rhyming quality, since they share similar phonetic patterns at the end."<|eot_id|>
coiner, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "coiner" ends with the sound /rɛməʊ/, which has the same vowel sound (/eɪ/) as well as similar consonant sounds (the nasalized 'n' is not distinct). On the other hand, the word "premo" also ends with the sound /ˈprēmō/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequence ("-nier-" vs "-remo"), both sequences end with the
mijares, tabares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mijares" and "tabares" do rhyme.Justification:The words share similar ending patterns: both end with "-ares". This indicates that they follow the same pattern of vowels ("a") and consonants ("-r"s), which is one way to define rhyming in English (and Spanish). The difference lies only in their initial letters (-mi- vs -ta-) but not in the final syllable or sound, making them perfect examples of rhym
rossin, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "rossin" (-sin) matches with the ending sound of "obryan" (-yan), which indicates they share similar phonetic patterns, specifically:1. Different initial consonants: /r/ in "rossin", /o/ or no-consonant (silent start) in "obryan"2. Identical vowels: both end with -i- sound3. Consequent consonantal pattern: "-n" follows the
hammann, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "hammann" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, and then has two vowels "a" and another silent letter combination "-nn", making up to three phonemes (/hæm-ə-n/n). The second part of comparison, "borneo," also consists of several parts: "/bɔr-", '/ni-', and '-ø/. Here we can see that both words end with similar combinations of letters (silent '
cede, kisling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cede" ends with the sound /ed/, which is composed of the vowels /e/ and the consonant /d/. The word "kissing" (not "Kisling", I assume that's a typo) also has its final syllable ending in "-ing," which can be broken down into the vowels /i/ and the consonant /ng/.Since both words end with distinct combinations of vowels and consonants, they do not exactly rhyme according to traditional
calculation, agglomeration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "calculation" and "agglomeration" both end with the suffix "-ation". This means they share similar phonetic patterns, specifically:* Different initial consonants ("c-" vs. "a-")* Identical vowels ("-al-" in each word)* Consonantal endings (-tion)According to this definition of rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that indeed, "calculation
kantle, chantal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kentle" has the sound /ntl/, which matches with the corresponding parts of the word "chantal", where we can identify the same sequence: /tɑːn/. This means they share similar phonetic patterns, specifically in terms of their ending sounds (/ntl/) being distinct from each other while having matching vowels (/e/ vs. /a:/).<|eot_id|>
fluorescence, evanescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The two words "fluorescence" and "evanesceance" (not evanescence, which is the correct word) do indeed rhyme because they share similar ending phonemes /ənsɛns/ and /ənˈsens/. The vowels 'e' in both words follow by distinct consonantal clusters ('nc', 'vsc') that produce identical sound outcomes (/ənz/, /ənz/) when pronounced together with the preceding syllables. Therefore
baranowski, osowski, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-osw" in both "baranowski" and "Osowski" has the same vowel sound ("o") and consecutive consonant letters ("sw"). This meets the criteria for rhyming, which requires matching vowel quality (in this case, /ɔ/) as well as similar or identical final consonantal sequence (/sʊ/, where "/s/" represents one of several possible pronunciations).<|eot_id|>
shill, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shill" and "Arsenault" (not Arseneau) do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "shill" ends with the sound /l/, whereas the surname Arsenault typically has the ending "-t", which is a distinct difference in consonantal sounds. Additionally, while both words contain vowels ("i" and "a"), they don't share the same final consonant-vowel combination to qualify as rhyming. Therefore, I
weary, leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "weary" ends with the sound /riː/, which is pronounced as "ree", whereas the word "leary" also ends with the same sound "/liː/", again, pronounced as "lee". Since they share the same ending vowels (/iː/) but differ in their starting consonants (w- vs l-), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds
cheryl, caryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "cheryl" ends with the sound /l/ (a consonant) followed by the diphthong "er" (/ɛr/, where both vowels share similar qualities), whereas the word "caryll" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /l/ + "/ɛr". The difference lies in their pronunciation, but not in the rhyming criteria mentioned above. In phonetics, this type of matching would be
alterations, syndications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "alterations" ends with the sound /tʃən̩z/.2. The word "syndications" also ends with the same sound, namely /dɪˈkeɪʃənz/.As both words end with the same sequence of phonemes (sounds), they can be considered to rhyme according to the criteria you specified: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds
nix, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The justification is as follows:* The word "nix" ends with the sound /ks/.* The suffix "-zulli" appears to end with the sound /li/.Since they don't share the same ending consonant(s) or similar vowel-consonant combinations, according to linguistic rules for rhyming (different consonants + identical V&C), I conclude that "nix" and "zulli" do not rhyme.<|eot_id|>
brony, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the word "brony", we find the sound combination "-ny" which has distinct consonantal features (the nasal /n/) before the final -y, representing the same phoneme (/j/. Similarly, for the word "smullen", there's also a distinctive sequence of letters ("-ll") preceding another instance of "/l/" with following '/u/' as part of the diphthong ('ul'). Both instances exhibit dissimilar patterns within their respective syll
patrol, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "patrol" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the suffix "-enix" has its own unique sequence of vowels (-i-) and final consonant (x). Since they do not share similar endings in terms of both consonants and vowel-consonant combinations, we can conclude that "patrol" and "enix" don't quite rhyme according to traditional rhyming criteria. However, some might argue
replication, adulteration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "replication" (-cation) has different consonants (t-ion) compared to "-adulteration" (-ration). Although they share similar letters, their phonetic pronunciation differs in terms of vocalic quality ("i" vs."a") and final consonantal cluster (/tion/, /ræˈʃɪn/).In rhyming analysis, we consider not only letter similarity but also phonemic correspondence between syllables
cane, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cane" ends with the sound /ne/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" (a single, short e) and the consonant "/n/", whereas the word "jamb" also ends with the same combination: `/am`b`, where `"m"` is another consonant that follows the identical vowel `"/a"` and consonant `"/mb"`. The difference lies in their final consonantal part (`/n` vs. `/mb`). This
homan, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "homan" ends with the sound /nɪt/	+ It has the same vowels (/o/) but different consonants (m vs lit)* The word "litigating" also ends with the sound /teɪting/	+ Although they differ in their overall meaning, both end with -ing which changes the final syllable's pronunciationSince they don't share similar consonantal sequences after the shared '
vary, unwary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "vary" ends with the sound /ry/* "unwary" also ends with the same sound combination, specifically "/nərɪ/" which can be broken down into:	+ The nasalized schwa sound (/n/) followed by	+ A voiced alveolar stop (the 'r' in this case) followed by	+ The diphthongal "i" sound (a glide towards the front
saad, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saad" and "smullen" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The word "saad" ends with the sound /d/, which is a consonantal sound.2. The word "smullen" also ends with the same consonantal sound /n/.3. Both words end in -a (identical vowels).4. Since they share similar ending patterns (-da- and -mull-en), we can conclude that they exhibit rhyming
gitano, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gitano" ends with the sound /ɪnō/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" and the nasalized vowel "/ŋ/", while the word "brion" also has this same ending, consisting of the vowels "/aɪ/" (which can be pronounced as a single monophthong) and no final consonant. The differences in their endings lie solely within the distinctiveness of their respective diphthongs ("in
biery, mcqueary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "biery" has the sound /iːr/.2. The second word "mcqueary" also ends with the same diphthongal sound "/ɪər/".3. Since both words end with the identical sequence of vowels (/iː/) and consonants (//), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming, which involves having similar or identical final phonemes in two words.
anticancer, lancer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "anticancer" and "lancer" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The suffix "-er" in both words has the same sound (/r/) which is considered as one of the criteria for rhyming.2. Both words end with the letter combination "-nc-" that represents distinct vowels (the letters 'i' and 'a') but share similar phonetic values due to their placement within the word's pronunciation context.3. Although there might exist slight
cheery, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "cheery" ends with the sound /ēri/, which has the same ending as "keary", also having the sound /ēri/. The difference lies in their initial letters, where "ch-" (the voiceless palatal fricative) differs from "k-", but this does not affect the rhyming quality since only the final vowels and following consonants matter for determining perfect rhyme.<|eot_id|>
meeler, biehler, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "meeler" ends with the sound /r/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels "ee", then another consonant "/l". On the other hand, the word "biehler" also has three parts - a consonant "/b/", two vowels "i-e", and finally another consonant "/hl-r/. Since both pairs of words end with distinct consonantal sounds (/lr/) after having similar vocalic components ("e"), they
shaul, oelkers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "shaul" and "oelkers" do not perfectly match in terms of their rhyming criteria, as the consonant sound following the vowels is slightly different ("l" vs. no distinct consonant). However, considering that both end with "-ol", which has similar phonetic properties (identical vowel sound), I would argue they share some degree of similarity in their ending sounds. Nevertheless, if we strictly adhere to traditional notions of perfect rhyme requiring
reiteration, electrification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "reitation" ends with the sound /ˌriːtɪˈteɪʃən/, which has the same vowel ("i") and ending consonant combination ("-tion"). The word "electrification", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /fɪˈktrɪfeɪʃn/, where we can see that both words share similar patterns:- Same vowels: Both end with the long
homann, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "homann" and "reisenauer" can be broken down into their individual phonetic components:* Homann:	+ ho (identical vowels)	+ mann (different consonants, but same ending sound /n/)* Reisenauer	+ rei- (identical starting syllable with the same vowel combination ie/aue/r)	+ senau-er (ending in -uer which has the same final consonant
mccleery, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mccleery" and "Keary" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The last syllables of both words ("ry") share the same sound (/riː/) which is considered as rhyming.* Although they differ in their initial letters (Mc vs K), this does not affect the final result since we're considering only the ending parts for determining whether two words rhyme or not. In linguistics, when examining word pairs to determine if they rhyme
schlee, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:To determine if the words "schlee" and "hannam" rhyme, we need to analyze their ending sounds.* The word "schlee" ends with "-ee", which has two consecutive vowels.* The word "hannam" also ends with "-amm".Although they don't appear similar at first glance, let's break down each sound:	+ In "schlee-ee", the double "e"s make up one distinct phonetic
litty, kansas-city, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "litty" ends with the sound /i/, which is a vowel, followed by the consonantal sound /t/. The phrase "Kansas City", on the other hand, also has the same ending pattern: the final syllable "-ty" in Kansas City can be broken down into two parts - the diphthong "/aɪ/" (which functions as one unit) representing the vowels, followed by the consonantal sound /t/.Since
keene, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "keene" ends with the sound /ēn/, which consists of two distinct parts - the single vowel phoneme "/e/" (identical) and the nasal consonantal phoneme "/n/" (different). Similarly, the suffix "-carbons" also has its own unique combination of vowels and consonants (/ər/) that do not match exactly to those in "keene". Therefore, based on this criterion, we can conclude that they don't
encase, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "encase" ends with the sound /seɪs/, which consists of two distinct parts: 1) the diphthong "ei", representing the same vowels, and 2) the consonantal part "/z/" or "/s/", depending on pronunciation. On the other hand, the word "caen" (presumably referring to Caën in France) also has its own ending pattern "-eɛn". Although both endings
subordination, computerization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the two words "subordination" and "computerization" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. The last three letters of each word are "-ation". This indicates that they share similar vowels ("i") as well as consonantal endings ("-tion"). Since this is true for both words, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition you provided (different consonants preceded by identical vowel-consonant combinations).<|eot_id|>
improvisation, indignation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "improvisation" and "indignation" meet the criteria for rhyming because they share similar ending sounds /-asion/. Specifically, both words end with the sequence of letters "-ision", which indicates that their final vowels (/i/) and following consonants (both nasalized) sound alike when spoken aloud. This similarity in phonetic pattern is what defines perfect or exact rhymes between two words.<|eot_id|>
silveri, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "silver" ends with the sound /rɪ/, which is made up of the identical vowels "/i/" (not actually present in this case, but implied) and the same consonantal ending "/r/. Similarly, the word "ferry" also ends with the sound /ri/. Since they both share similar vowel-consonant combinations (/i+r/) at their end, we can say that they do indeed rhyme. Therefore, my answer to your question
hymen, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "hymen" ends with the sound /n/2. "kern" (or more accurately, "kearn") also ends with the same sound /rn/Since both end with similar consonantal sounds (/n/) and identical vowel sounds (), they technically do not meet the criteria for rhymes according to linguistic rules of perfect rhymes in English poetry, which require that two syllables or words should share their final vowels but differ from
saudi, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Saudia" (Saudi) and "Hamman(n)" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "Saudia" ends with the sound /iː/, which is pronounced as a long "ee".* The word "hammann" has multiple possible pronunciations depending on regional accents or dialects; however, one common pronunciation would end with the diphthong "/ɑmən/".* Since they don't share similar
kehn, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kehn" and "brunner" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "kehnen" is pronounced as /kɛn/, with the ending sound being "-en".* On the other hand, "Brunner" has multiple possible pronunciations (e.g., /ˈbʁu.nər/ or /bru.neɪ), but none of them match the exact phonetic sequence "/-eh-n/" in "
sidor, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidor" ends with the sound /r/, while the phrase "chlorofluoro-car-bons" can be broken down into its parts as follows:* chloro- ending in /ro/* fluoro- ending in /ro/Both instances end with the same vowels (/o/) and similar consonantal sounds (/r/). Therefore, according to linguistic rules for rhyming, they do meet the criteria of having different consonants followed by
mccreary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "mccreary" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of two distinct letters, while the word "beary" also ends with the same sequence "/er/", where both vowels ("e") come before another consonantal letter pair ("/y"). The presence or absence of the initial consonants does not affect this rhyming condition since they do not change the phonetic value of the ending syllables. Therefore, according to the criteria you specified
coiner, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "coined" has the ending sound /nɛd/, which is made up of:* Different consonants: n* Identical vowels: ē (long e)* Consonant(s) following the vowel: dOn the other hand, the surname "Barrineau" ends with the sound /oʊ/. This can be broken down into:* Vowel: o* No distinct consonant preceding or accompanying this vowel
sighed, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a consonant, while its final vowel sound is pronounced as long "i". The word "con", on the other hand, also has a single consonantal sound (/n/) following this same long "i" pronunciation of the vowels. Since they both share similar ending patterns (different consonants + identical vowel), we can conclude that indeed, "sighed" and "con" do rhyme according to
szalay, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "szalay" ends with the sound /y/, which is a consonantal ending, while "jama" also has this same /ya/ combination of vowels (identical) and consonant (/m/) at its end. This matches the definition of rhyming where there should be different consonants preceded by identical vowel/consonant combinations in both words. In this case, although they come from distinct linguistic roots ("Hungarian surname Szálai
gumm, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gum" ends with the sound /m/, which is followed by the vowels "u", then another "m". The word "roesner" also has two syllables: one ending in "oes", followed by "-ner".In both cases, we can see that they share the same final vowel ("u") and following consonant ("m"). This meets the criteria for rhyming words having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore
goyim, huguet, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**I justified my response as follows:The word "goyim" ends with the sound /m/, while "huguet" ends with the sound /t/. Since they do not share the same final consonant or subsequent vowel-consonant combination, they do not technically rhyme according to linguistic standards of rhyming.In linguistics, perfect rhymes require that two words end in the exact same sequence of phonemes (sounds), including both vowels and consonants. In
nyx, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "nyx" ends with the sound /ks/, which consists of two distinct consonantal phonemes: /n/ (the nasal 'n' in 'no') and /k/. The second syllable, "oslo", also has a double-consonental ending /sl/.When we examine their final parts:* Both end with vowels (/y/ or /o/) as well.* And both follow those vowels with unique combinations of consonants
education, calibration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Education ends with the sound "tion" which has the same vowel (i) and double consonant ("n") combination.2. Calibration also ends with the sound "ion" which again has the same vowel (i) but single consonant ("o").Since both words end in similar sounding vowels, they do not meet the criteria for rhyming because of their differing final consonant combinations. Therefore, my initial response was 'yes', indicating
nary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "nary" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of a distinct consonant ("r") followed by a single-vowel phoneme (/i/) and another consonant (also "/r"). The word "dery", on the other hand, also ends with this same sequence: a distinct consonant ("dr"), a single-vowel phoneme (/e/i), and finally, another consonant ("/y"/). Since both sequences share the exact
health, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "health" ends with the sound /θt/, which consists of a voiceless interdental fricative (theta) + /t/. On the other hand, the surname "Arsenault/Arseneau" typically has its final syllable pronounced as "-o", ending in the diphthong /ɔʊ/. Although they don't share exact matching letters or digraphs at their end, both possess distinct vowels (/e/)
attenuation, carnation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Attenuation: The word has the letters "t" (consonant), then "u", which can represent multiple vowels, including long or short "o". It also ends with "-tion".2. Carnation: This word starts with "c" (different from "att-" in attenuate), then has the letter combination of "a-r-n-a-tion".As per your request to check if they meet the criteria for rh
quintessence, obsolescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "quintessence" and "obsolescence" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their ending syllables (the part that comes after the last vowel). In this case:* The word "quintessence" ends with "-ense", which has the sound /ɛns/.* The word "obsolescence" ends with "-cence", which also has the same sound pattern (/sən
shelor, olokuei's, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer:** No, the words "shelor" and "-olokuei's" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their final syllables (or phonemes). In this case, let's break down each word:* Shelor: The last part of the word is /lor/, which consists of the consonant sound /l/ followed by the vowels /o/ and another /r/.* -Olukuei's
francesmary, lary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "france" ends with the sound /seɪ/* The name "Mary" also ends with the same sound, which is /eɪ/* Both of them share this ending pattern (different consonants + identical vowels and final consonents), making their last syllables rhyming.Additionally,"Larry"ends withthe sound /əri/So all three names ("Frances", Mary, Lary)
kaney, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kaney" ends with the sound /ney/, which is pronounced as "nee", where the last two letters ("nay") form a single phonetic unit, often referred to as a diphthong or digraph in linguistics. The second part of the comparison phrase "reasner" also has this same ending: "/sɛrərnər/" (the actual pronunciation may vary depending on regional accents), but for our purpose, let's break
invitations, estimations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "invitations" ends with the sound /tions/, which is pronounced as /ˈɪvə(t)ʃənz/. The word "estimations", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound /tions/, but this time it's spelled differently (i-e-s-t-i-m-a-t). Both words share the same ending sequence of vowels (-ations), making them rhyming words according to their phonetic similarity.<|eot_id|>
non-residential, essential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "non" ends with the sound /n/.2. The word "residential" also has the same ending, which includes the letters "-ial", making its last two letters ("l") distinct from those in "non".3. On the other hand, both "essential" end with the letter combination "-al".In rhyming terms, we look for differences between final consonantal clusters or single consonants preceding vowels of equal
combinations, iterations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "combinations" and "iterations" meet the criteria for rhyming:* They both end with "-ations", which means they share the same ending sound.* The vowels in each word ("i"s) come before similar consonantal endings, making them phonetically equivalent (the "/t/"s).Therefore, according to linguistic standards, we can conclude that "combinations" and "iterations" do indeed rhyme!<|eot_id|>
aickin, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the final consonant sound in "aicken" (the double 'n' at the end) does not match with any corresponding consonantal sequence after the vowel sound ('e') in "bruneY". In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share similar ending patterns of vowels and following consonants.In this case, even though both words contain some matching phonemes ("i", "k"), their terminal sequences do not meet the criteria for rh
reevaluation, exclamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:* "re-evaluation" ends with the sound /ˌriɪəlʊˈeɪʃ(ə)n/, which consists of:	+ Different consonants: none (the last two letters 'n' is repeated)	+ Identical vowels: -ue- (both instances share the same vowel phoneme, pronounced as /ju/)	+ Consonant sounds: The second part '-lation-' has no distinct conson
gyration, popularization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gyration" ends with the sound /ation/, which has the same vowel (i) and consonant (/n/) as the suffix "-larization", found in the word "popularization". This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words end with similar but not necessarily identical phonemes. Therefore, I conclude that "gyration" and "popolarization" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
priscilla, churilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "priscilla" ends with the sound /əlɪlə/ (the letters "-lla"), while the word "churilla" also ends with this same sound pattern, which means they share similar phonetic properties in their ending syllables. This satisfies the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but identical vowels and final consonant(s) sounds. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "priscilla" and "
coagulation, legalization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "coagulation" and "legalization" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is "-ation". This means that they both end with the letter combination of vowels ("i") and consonants (the letters "n"). Therefore, according to the definition provided in your question - having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds -, we can conclude that these words do rhyme. The rhyming scheme would therefore be /ˌko
nyx, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "nyx" ends with the sound /ks/, which has distinct consonant phonemes, while "jaimie" ends with the diphthong /aɪ/. The vowels in both cases do not match exactly (although they share some similarities), but more importantly, their following consonantal sounds differ significantly ("k"s vs. no consonant). Therefore, according to standard linguistic criteria for rhyming, "nyx" and "J
smarty, moriarty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "smarty" ends with the sound /ty/, which consists of two distinct letters (t+y). Similarly, the word "moriarty" also ends with the same combination (/ry/) consisting of two unique consonantal phonemes (r+y). Since both ending combinations share no common vowels or consonants in their final parts, they meet the criteria for rhyming as described - having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
prem, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "prem" ends with the sound /ɛm/, which is a distinct combination of vowels (the schwa sound) and the consonantal sound /m/. The word "jammer", on the other hand, also has this same ending sound /ər/.As they share similar final phonemes (/ɛm/) in both words, we can conclude that their rhyming criteria match: having different consonants preceded by identical vowel-consonant combinations.In
costilla, churilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "costilla" ends with the sound /a/, which is also present in the second syllable of "churilla". Additionally, both words end with the same consonantal sound (/l/) after their respective vowels. This meets the criteria for rhyming as described (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
cayne, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:To determine if "caine" and "Boerner" rhyme, we need to examine their ending parts.* The word "cain(e)" ends with the sound /n/.* The surname "Boerner" is pronounced as /bɔˈrərn(ə)r/, which breaks down into:	+ The syllable "-oer-" has the same vowels ("e") in both.	+ Both end with distinct consonantal sounds:
necks, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "necks" ends with the sound /ks/, which is made up of two distinct consonants (k and s). On the other hand, the name "Arsenault" or "Arseneau" typically has its final syllable pronounced as "-o", making the last part of this surname end with the sound /uː/. Since both parts share the same vowel sound (/eks/ vs. /uo/) but differ in their subsequent consonantal
murillo, biondolillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "murillo" is "-ilo", which consists of two consonants ("l") followed by one vowel ("i"), whereas in "biondolillo", we also see the same pattern: three consonants ("-nd-") preceded by one vowel ("o"). This satisfies the condition for rhyming, where both words share similar patterns of vowels and consonants at their ends.<|eot_id|>
neary, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "neary" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of two parts: a single vowel sound "/e/" (or sometimes pronounced as schwa `/ə`/) followed by another consonantal sound "/r/", whereas the word "dreary" also ends with the same sound combination, namely "/ri/. The final part "-ry" in both cases has distinct initial consonantic sounds but shares similar ending vowels ("i"), thus satisfying the criteria for rh
appealing, heeling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "appealing" ends with the sound /ling/, which consists of the letter combination "-eling".2. "heeling" also ends with the same sound "/ling/", consisting of the letters "-eing".Since both words end with the exact same phonetic sequence, they do indeed share similar rhyming qualities (different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonants). Therefore, I conclude that yes, "appealing" and "heeling
shelley, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelley" ends with the sound /lee/, which is composed of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant "/l/. On the other hand, the word "caen" also ends with the same sound /ee(n)/, where again we see the identical vowel "/e/", but this time accompanied by the nasalized consonantal sound "/n/.In phonetics, when two syllables or words end in similar patterns like V(C) (
solder, petrelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**The justification is as follows:1. "solder" ends with the sound /ər/2. The word "petrelli" (note: I assume you meant to type "Petrelly") also has the same ending, which can be broken down into:	* "pell-" having the sound /ɛl/ or similar	* "-y" being a single consonantal soundSince both words end in distinct consonant-vowel-consonant
explanations, exclamations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "explanations" ends with the sound /tions/, which is made up of two distinct parts: the vowels "/i/" (long or short) and the consonantal ending "/n/s/. The same can be said for the word "exclamations", as it also has the suffix "-tion"s, but in this case, they belong to separate syllables that contain similar phonetic patterns (/eks kləˈmeɪʃnz/) respectively
mcnary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "McNary" and "McCrary" do rhyme.Justification:The rhyming criterion is that two or more words share similar ending sounds. In this case, both "McNary" and "McCrary" end with the same sound /ri/. The vowels in each word ("a" vs. "i") don't affect their ability to rhyme because they're not immediately preceded by distinct consonantal sounds (which would change the pronunciation). Therefore, based
easel, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "easel" ends with the sound /l/, whereas "brunner" (not "Bruner", which is a proper noun) would end with the sound /r/. Since they do not share the same final consonant-vowel-consonant sequence, they do not technically rhyme in English phonology rules.Note that while this analysis holds true for most accents of standard American or British English, there might exist regional variations where pronunciations differ slightly
health, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "health" ends with the sound /th/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the voiced dental fricative (/θ/) and the voiceless alveolar stop (/t/). The second syllable in the name "Jimmie", on the other hand, has the diphthongial combination "/iːm/", where the first part ("ee") represents a long close front unrounded vowel (/.ɪˈmi
laack, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "la" in both words has the same sound (long 'a' or open 'ah')* The following consonants ("ck", "sm") differ between the two words* However, they do not affect the identification of rhyming vowels because their pronunciation does not change when paired with either word's vowel.Therefore, considering only the shared long-vowel-sound criteria for rhymes, we can conclude that "lack" and "sm
mary, canary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "mary" (/ɛri/) matches with the ending sound of "canary" (/əˈnærɪi/), which meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, /m/, /c/, etc.) but sharing identical vowels and final consonant sounds (/ɛ/, /er/i). The stress patterns also match in both cases, as they end on unstressed syllables
biery, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "biery" and "thiery" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (/ri/) which is composed of a single vowel ("e") and one or more consecutive consonants (the "r"). This meets the definition of perfect rhymes in English poetry and music.<|eot_id|>
hamann, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their final syllables in terms of the same or similar ending sound.In this case, let's break down each word:- "hamann" ends with "-n"- "zarroli" ends with "-oli"The key difference lies not only in the presence but also in type (vowel/consonent) and number (-1 vs -2) of letters that follow the vowels ("a",
remittance, pittance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "remittance" ends with "-ance", which has the same vowel sound ("i") as well as similar but not exactly matching consonantal ending ("-ntce"). On the other hand, the word "pittance" also ends with "-nce", sharing the exact same vowel sound ("i") and very close (but still distinct) consonantal endings ("-tnc").In rhyming analysis, this similarity in both vowel sounds and almost-identical conson
easily, risner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "easily" and "risner" do not meet the criteria for rhyming because they don't share the same ending sound.* "Easily" ends with "-ly", which is a suffix that changes its pronunciation when added to certain roots.* "Risner" has no similar equivalent in terms of phonetic patterns, as it's likely a proper noun or a unique word without any established linguistic connection.In linguistics, perfect rh
noxso, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nox" and "cannyry" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "nox" ends with the sound /ks/, which is made up of distinct consonantal phonemes (the voiceless velar plosive /k/ and the voiceless alveolar sibilant /s/) preceded by the same vowels (/o/). On the other hand, the suffix "-ary" in the word "can-ney-r-y" forms part of its
tsuda, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tsuda" and "healthy" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "tsuda" ends with the sound /da/, which consists of two distinct parts: the voiced alveolar stop /d/ (a consonantal part) and the voiceless schwa vowel /u̯ɑ/ (the vowel-consonant combination).* On the other hand, the word "healthy" ends with the diphthongal sound /li
altomare, degutare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "altomare" ends with the sound /-ere/* "degutare" also ends with the same sound /-ere/As both words end with the exact same ending, which includes distinct vowels (-e) accompanied by similar consonantal sounds (r), they do indeed rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rhyming in Italian language.<|eot_id|>
kanner, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kanner" ends with the sound /r/, which is not present in the word "jimi". However, both words end with a silent letter (the final 'R' in "KANNER" and no letters at all after "JIMI"). Additionally, they share similar vowels (/er/) before their respective endings. Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, we can consider them as having matching vowel-consonant combinations ("-
replication, arbitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of syllables "plication" and "itation", as well as "arbi-" in both words, end with similar sounds:* The first set ("lication") ends with /-eɪʃən/" (the sound combination of "-ation")* The second set ("iration") also ends with "/-iˈteɪʃn/"* Both share the same ending sound pattern: <C1Vowel C2>
mary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mary" ends with the sound /ry/, which is made up of the consonant "r" and the diphthong "ay". The word "mcnary" also ends with the same sequence, specifically "/rn/" (the combination of the letters "m", "c", and "y"), but pronounced as if they were one unit ("ray").Since both words end with the same phonetic pattern (/Vowel + Consonant), namely `/r
imitations, alterations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "imitations" ends with the sound /tions/.* The word "alterations" also ends with the same sound /tions/.Since they share the same ending, which includes both vowels (i/o) and consonants (-ns), we can conclude that their final syllables do indeed match in terms of rhyming criteria: having different consonants but identical vowel-consonant sounds (/o/ns). Therefore, I believe the
destination, amalgamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The two words "destination" and "amalgamation" do not share the same ending sound, which is one of the key characteristics of rhyming words.* "Destination" ends with "-tion", where the final vowels ("i") and consonents ("n") differ.* "Amalgamation" ends with "-ation", but this time the final vowels (also "o"s) and consonent ("m") also don't match exactly in both words
scary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "scary" ends with the sound /ry/, which has a distinct set of consonants (r) followed by a single vowel letter (a). The word "mcnary", on the other hand, also ends with the same combination of letters (/ry/) after the prefix "m". Since both end with the same sequence of vowels and consonants, they technically meet the criteria for rhyming in English phonology. Therefore, I conclude that
non-residential, preferential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two syllables of each word, "residential" ends with "-ional", which has the same vowels ("i") and ending consonents ("-l"). Similarly for the other pair: "preferential" also ends with "-ial". The only difference lies in their initial letters (non- vs pre-) but this doesn't affect whether they rhyme or not since rhyming depends on matching terminal phonemes, not prefixes or roots. Therefore, both pairs share
dewinter, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "dew" ends with the sound /wɛr/, which has the vowels "e" and "a", and the consonant "r".* The suffix "-winter" adds to this, making the combination of sounds "/dwɪntər/", where we can see that there's still no change in the vowel or consonant following.* Similarly for the second part: 	+ The word "bow" ends
gertner, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "gernther" has the sound /rɛnθər/, whereas the name "Brynna" is pronounced as /braiˈnæ/. Although they don't share exact spellings, their phonetic pronunciations differ only in the initial consonantal sequence (/gn- vs. /br-) but retain similar vowels ("er"/"eɪ/"a") and final consonantal sequences (/-thər"/
saad, keeny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "saad" ends with the sound /d/, which matches with the ending of the second syllable in "Keen-y", also being "/y/. The vowels preceding them, 'a' and 'e', respectively, remain unchanged. This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, '/d/' vs '/n/') but sharing similar vowel-consonant combinations (/ay/) at their end."<|eot_id|>
smullen, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "smullen" ends with the sound /nəlɛn/, which has the same vowel and consonant sequence as the word "jemmie", ending in /miji/. Both words share this characteristic, meeting the criteria for rhyming.<|eot_id|>
chery, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "cherry" ends with the sound /ry/, which consists of two distinct letters: R (consonant) + Y (vowel).2. Similarly, the word "mccary" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: C (consonant) + AY (identical vowels).Since both ending sequences share similar characteristics - having identical vowels and differing consonants - they can be considered rhyming.
seider, shelly, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "seider" ends with "-er", which has a distinct sound, whereas the word "shelly" also ends with "-ly", having another unique sound combination of vowels and consonants (the diphthong /iːlɪ/, to be precise). Since they don't share similar final syllable patterns (-r/-y), we can conclude that they do not perfectly rhyme according to standard phonological criteria for rhyming in English
rossin, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "rossin" and "premo" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "rossin" ends with the sound /nɪŋ/, which has the same vowels (i) but different final consonants (/s/) compared to the word "premo", which ends with the sound /ˈriːmō/. The difference in their ending consonantal sounds prevents them from rhyming according to phonological rules of English language.<|eot_id|>
kaine, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kaine" ends with the sound /neɪn/, which has the same vowel and following consonant ("n") as the suffix "-neau", which is pronounced like "/noʊ/. Since they share similar ending phonemes (/eɪn/) despite having distinct initial parts, we can conclude that "kaine" and "Arsen-eau" do indeed rhyme according to linguistic conventions for rhyming in English (and many other languages
side, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" ends with the sound /ide/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as well as the consonant sound (/d/). Similarly, the word "encase" also ends with the sound /ease/, which again shares the same vowel sound (/e/) and consecutive consonant sounds (/sze/ or /z/ in some pronunciations).Since both pairs of words end with similar combinations of vowels and consonant sounds (identical
schuler, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* The word "schuler" ends with the sound /rʊlər/.* The word "barrineau" ends with the sound /oʊ/. Although they don't share exact vowels, both end with distinct vocalic sounds.* Since they differ in their final consonantal sounds (/r/, /n/) as well as the preceding syllable structure (the former has two syllables while the latter has three), we can conclude that they
seda, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "seda" ends with the sound /də/* "zell" also ends with the same sound /l/Both words end with distinct consonant sounds (/d/ vs./l/) but share the same final vowel sound (/ə/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words should have differing initial consonant(s) followed by similar (identical in this case) vowels and ending consonent(s). Therefore,
coinsurance, occurrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "coinsurance" ends with the sound /ns/* "occurrence" also ends with the same sound /rs/Although they end differently, both ending sounds contain vowels (i) which match in terms of identity (/ɪ/) and then follow similar consonantal patterns (-s/-r). Therefore, according to phonological rules for rhyming, we can conclude that indeed these two words do share matching vowel-consonant combinations at their endings
kenna, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenna" ends with the sound /nə/, which is pronounced as "en". Meanwhile, the word "jammer" also has the same ending sound "/mɛr/", where the first part "-am-" can be ignored for rhyming purposes since only the final two letters matter in determining if they rhyme or not. Both end with similar vowels (/e/) and consecutive consonants (the nasal stop "n"/and/or the alve
kuhn, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kuhn" ends with the sound /n/, which is not present in the ending of the second part, "breighner", where there's no similar consonantal sequence to match up against each other. However, both parts end with vowels ("u" and "er"), respectively, making them share that commonality as per the definition provided - having different consonants but same/vowel/consonant (V/C) pattern at their endings. Hence they
connor, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "connor" ends with the sound /r/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the word "barrineau" also has its own unique set of final consonants (/u/) that differ from those in "Connor". Additionally, both words end with a silent or reduced vowel sound (the "o" in Connor becomes almost mute), making them rhyming pairs according to the criteria you mentioned - having different consonants preceded by identical vowels
schoeller, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schoeller" ends with the sound /er/, which is pronounced as a diphthong (a combination of two vowels). This means that when we analyze its ending, we consider both parts ("oel" and "r") together to form this unique phonetic sequence. On the other hand, the word "brun" also has a similar pattern at the end (/n/) where there's no distinct difference in terms of vocalic or conson
stiller's, killers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "stiller" (-ill'er) has the same vowels ("i") as well as similar but not exactly matching consonantal sounds (/l/) compared to the word "killers". Although they don't match perfectly, they share enough similarities in their final syllable pronunciation (the diphthongs /ɪər/ for both), which makes them rhyming according to phonological rules. The slight difference between the two sets of conson
cleary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "clearly" ends with the sound /liːr/, which has the same ending as "beary", which also ends with the sound /ri/. The last two letters in each of those syllables ("er") form what we call a rhyming pair, because they share the same vowel and final consonant (in this case, both being "R"). This meets one criterion for rhymin'!<|eot_id|>
patrol, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "patrol" ends with the sound /ol/, which is pronounced as a single phoneme (oʊl). Similarly, the word "kanne" also ends with the same sound combination (/an/) that can be considered equivalent to "/ol". Although they differ in their initial consonantal sounds ("p-" vs "-k"), this criterion for rhyming focuses on the final syllable's ending vowels and following consonant(s) rather than its beginning
incase, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:The words "incase" and "kanner" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (/er/) which is made up of two identical vowels (i/e) followed by the same consonantal ending (-r). This pattern matches the definition of perfect rhymes in linguistics.In phonetics, this can be represented using the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA): /ɪnˈseɪs/ ("inc
cona, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cona-" (from the word "consumer") and "-liner" share similar ending patterns, with both having distinct consonants ("n", "r"/) preceded by vowels ("o"). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry, where two or more words can be said to rhyme if they contain the same sound at their final syllables. In this case, despite being from separate roots, the suffixes "-ona-" and "-er"-
guertin, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "guertin" ends with the sound /tin/, which has the same final consonantal phoneme (n) as well as the preceding vowel sound (/ɪ/) when compared to the word "jamb", which also ends with the sound /amp/. The initial vowels in both words, however, differ: "/u/" for "guertin" versus "/æ/" or "/a/" for "jam". Despite this difference, the subsequent conson
lockers, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lockers" ends with the sound /rz/, which is represented as -rs, while the word "Kearn" (assuming you meant to type "Learn") ends with the sound /rn/. Although they both end in vowels (-r), their preceding consonant combinations differ; therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, we can conclude that "lockers" and "learn" do indeed share similar ending sounds and technically rhyme.<|eot_id|>
predestination, self-congratulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* "pre" in predestination has the sound /prɛ/* "self" in self has the sound /sɛlf/* "-ation" in predestination has no effect on rhyming, as we're considering only the final vowels and consonents* "con-" in congratulation is not considered for comparison purposes (only comparing last two syllables)* "gra-tu-la"-tion ends with the sound /əˈt
rossin, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "rossin" and "Jimi" do not perfectly match the traditional definition of rhyming, which typically involves having exactly the same ending sound (consonant(s) + vowel). However, in modern linguistic contexts, especially with regards to phonetics, some linguists argue that near-rhymes or imperfect rhymes can still share similar sounds despite lacking perfect matching.In this case, both "rossin" and "Jimi" end with the
keaney, peragine, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Here's why:To determine if the words "keaney" and "peragine" rhyme, we need to check their ending sounds.* The word "keaney" ends with "-ney", which has the sound /niː/.* The word "peragine" ends with "-ine", which also has the sound /iːn/.Although both endings contain vowels (both "e"s), they don't share the same consonant(s) preceding them (/k
predestination, facilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "predestination" ends with the sound /ˌprɛdɪsˈteɪʃən/, which has the following characteristics:	+ Different consonants: p-r-d-s-t- (five distinct consonantal phonemes)	+ Identical vowels: ɪ, ɑ, e, i (the same set of vowel sounds repeated in sequence)On the other hand,* The
simulation, arbitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of syllables "sim-u-la-tion" (simulation) and "ar-bi-tration" both end with similar sounds, specifically:* "-tion"	+ In "simulation", this suffix has the same vowels ("-u-" & "") as in	+ In "arbitration", this suffix also has the same vowels ("-ri-", which can be pronounced similarly to "", especially when spoken quickly)As for the consonants preceding those
replication, affirmation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "replication" ends with the sound /teiʃən/, which has the same ending as the word "affirmation", namely "/ˌæfɪrˈmeɪʃn/", where both end in "-tion". They also share similar vowels, with "repl-ic-a-tion" having two syllables ("pla-" + "-tic") that match up to "af-fir-ma-tion"'
saudi, hamner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "saudi" ends with the sound /di/, which consists of the vowels "i" and the consonant "d".* The word "hamper" also ends with the same combination, namely the vowels "er" (which can be considered equivalent to single-vowel "e") and the consonant "p".Since they share similar final syllable patterns (/id/) despite having distinct initial parts ("sa-" vs. "ha
chery, mcgary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "cherry" (ry) matches with the ending sound of "McGary" (ry), which means they share similar vowels ("y") and consonants ("r"). This satisfies the condition for rhyming, where two or more words end in identical vowel-consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
derivation, incarceration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "derivation" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" (long 'e' or short 'i') and the consonant cluster "/tn/. The word "incarceration", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound combination: "/nkarəˈteɪʃən/", where we can identify the vowels "/a/" and again the consonant cluster "/rtn/.Since both words share the exact
gumm, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gum" ends with the sound /m/, which is a distinct consonantal sound, whereas in the word "zeal", there's no such consonantal sound (it has the diphthong "ea"). However, both words end with a similar vocalic quality (/ən/) for "m" and ("ɛl") respectively). This meets one of the criteria to determine if two words rhyme - having different consonants but ending with identical
alvares, minjares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "alvares" and "minjares" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. In this case:* The word "alvares" ends with "-es", which has the consonantal sound /z/ (or sometimes pronounced as /s/) followed by the vowel sound "/ɛ/".* The word "minjares" also ends with "-res", but its final
baran, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "baran" ends with the sound /n/, which is not present in the ending of the second word "gemme". Instead, "gemme" has the sound combination "-eme", where the vowels "e" and "m" form a single phonetic unit (the diphthong /ɛːm/). This meets the criteria for rhyming, as both end-sounds differ only in their final consonantal components while sharing
diaper, piper, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "diaper" ends with the sound /r/* "piper" also ends with the same sound /r/Additionally, both words end in -er which means they share the same final syllable structure (Vowel-Consonant). Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, we can conclude that "diaper" and "piper" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
essential, preferential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "essential" ends with the sound /ntal/, while "preferential" ends with the sound /shnal/. Although they both end in "-nal", their preceding consonant-vowel combinations differ, meeting the criteria for rhyming (different consonants + same vowels). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed rhyme according to this definition of perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
sheeler, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "sheeler" ends with the sound /r/* It has no consonants after that* The word "knicks" also ends with the sound /ks/Although they don't seem to share any obvious similarities, both end-sounds can be considered equivalent in terms of rhyming criteria (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed, "sheeler" and "kne
subordination, fluoridation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "subordination" ends with the sound /ʃən/, which consists of:	+ Different consonants: s, n	+ Identical vowels: ɪ (long 'i' sound)	+ Consonant sounds: n* The word "fluoridation" also ends with the sound /ˌfluərɪdeɪʃn/, which can be broken down into:
weary, o'leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "weary" ends with the sound /riː/, which is pronounced as "ree", whereas the suffix "-o'-Leary" has two syllables, ending in "/liːrɪ/" (pronounced like "lee-ry"). Although they don't share exactly the same sequence of letters, their final phonetic patterns match (/iː/ for both), making them rhyming words according to linguistic criteria.<|eot_id|>
kuhn, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kuhn" and "brun" do rhyme.Justification: The word "kuhn" ends with the sound /nʊn/, which consists of two distinct consonants ("k" and "h") followed by the same vowel sound (/u/) and another instance of the nasal stop consonant "/n". Similarly, the word "brun" also ends with the exact same combination of phonemes - /rʌn/. Since they share this similar
consummation, replication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two syllables of "consummation" ("nation") end with the sound /ˈnʃən/, which consists of the letter combination "-on". Similarly, in "replication", the final three letters ("-tion") also form the same ending as "/tɪʒən/", consisting again of the sequence "-ion".In terms of rhyming criteria:1. The vowels preceding the shared consonantal endings (-on/-
teary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "teary" ends with the sound /erē/, which consists of the same vowels (/e/) and similar consonants (the liquid lateral approximant /r/). The word "keary", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /erī/. Since both words share the same final sequence of phonemes (-er), they can be considered to rhyme according to their rhyming criteria in English poetry: having different initial consonants
seader, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seader" ends with the sound /r/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels /eɪ/ (long 'a' pronounced like in "play") and then another consonant /ər/. On the other hand, the word "Koehn" also has three parts - the first part being the letter combination "/k/", secondly having the vowel /oʊ/ (like in "go"), and finally ending
postdating, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:* The word "postdating" ends with the sound /ting/, which consists of two consonants (t, g) and one vowel (/i/) in that order.* The word "kanner" also ends with the same sequence: /r, nner/.* Since both ending sequences share the identical vowels "/e/" and differ only in their final consonantal sounds ("g", "n"), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming.Note:
haggart, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "haggart" ends with the sound /tɪn/, which consists of two distinct consonants ("g" and "r") followed by a single vowel sound (/i/) and another pair of consonants ("t"). Similarly, the word "guertin" also has three parts - a unique combination of vowels/consonants for each part:1. "Gu-" (unique starting sequence)2. "-er-"3. "-tin
keeny, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:1. "keeny" ends with the sound /ney/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant cluster "/n+y".2. "jama" also ends with the same sound combination, specifically "/a/" (vowel) + "" (consonant).Since both end-sequences share similar vowel-consonant combinations (/ey/) despite having distinct starting letters ("k-" vs. "j"), they can technically be considered rhym
transcontinental, coincidental, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "transcontinental" ends with the sound /nt/2. "coincidental" also ends with the same sound, namely "/nt/"Since both words end with the same sequence of letters (the letter combination "-ntl"), they share similar ending phonemes (/n/, /t/) which meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants but following them up with identical vowels and consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that yes,
swilling, filling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "swilling" ends with the sound /ing/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as in the word "filling", also ending with the suffix "-ing". This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two words end with distinct consonantal phonemes but share similar or identical vowel sounds. In this case, both words follow the pattern of having differing initial consonants (s- vs f-) before sharing the final -ING sequence.
diery, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two-word pair "diery" and "thiery" meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires:1. Different initial consonants: The first letter of each word differs; 'd' in "diery" vs. 't' in "thiery".2. Identical final vowels: Both words end with the same sound /ɛr/, pronounced as "er".Since both conditions are met, we can conclude that "
stagflation, avocation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "stagflation" and "avocation" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their ending phonemes (sounds). In this case:* The word "stagflation" ends with the sound /ˌstæfˈflɪtʃən/, which consists of the letters "-ation".* The word "avocation", on the other hand, ends with the sound /eɪˈ
saad, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "saad" ends with the sound /d/, which matches the ending of the word "cannery", also with the same diphthong (the combination of two vowels) "-er". The main difference lies in their initial letters, where "s" appears before "can", but this doesn't affect the rhyming criteria since we're considering only the final syllables (-eer).<|eot_id|>
kenn, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenn" ends with the sound /n/, which is not present in the word "prima". However, both words end with the same vowel sound "/ɪ/", making them rhyming words according to the definition of perfect rhyme where different consonants follow the same vowel and consonant sounds. Although they don't share any common ending letters (like -a or -e), their final vowels ("-i") make up for that difference. Therefore
oelkers, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three letters "ers" in both "oelkers" and "annex" share similar sound patterns, which means they meet the criteria for rhyming:* Both end with the same sequence of vowels ("er") and* The preceding consonants (/l/, /n/) also produce similar phonetic effects when pronounced together.In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as perfect or exact rhyme (also called full-rhyme). It's often
tomatino, avellino, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "tomatino" ends with the sound /no/, which is made up of the vowels "/o/" and the consonant "/n/", while the word "Avellino" also ends with the same combination, namely "/i-no". This matches the definition of rhyming where two or more words share similar ending sounds despite having potentially distinct initial parts. In this case, both words end in "-no", making them rhyme according to linguistic criteria for perfect
sterilizations, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "sterilizations" ends with the sound "-liz-zations", which has different consonants ("z"s) followed by the same vowels ("i") and another set of consonants ("-tions"). On the other hand, the second part "conn" also meets this criteria: ending in "-n".According to phonetic rules for rhyming (different consonants + same vowels), both parts meet the condition, making them rhymes. Therefore
schul, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "schul" ends with the sound /l/, which is then followed by the same vowels (/u/) as in the word "roesner", which also has the ending "/r/. The rhyming criteria of having different consonants (in this case, /s/ vs /r/) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (-/u/l/ vs -/o/r/) hold true for both words. Therefore, they do indeed rhyme
breeland, wheeland, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of syllables "bre" and "wheel", as well as "land" in both cases, share similar characteristics:* The vowels ("e") follow each other* They also match with respect to their preceding consonantal sound (the silent "b")In phonetics terms:- /brɛlænd/- /wiːlnənd/Both end with "-end" which has matching vocalic components (/i/) and final
scholer, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholar" ends with the sound /rɪl/, which consists of the identical vowel sound "/ə/" (a neutral vowel) and the same consonantal sound "/r/", whereas "nex" also has the ending sound /eks/. Although they don't share exact letters, their phonetic representations match in terms of having distinct vowels and corresponding consonant sounds (/iː/ vs./ʌ/) at the end. This meets the criteria for
lockers, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllable of "lockers" ends with /rz/, which has distinct consonants (r, z), while in "bronny", we see the ending "/ni/" having similar vowels (/o/) but not matching consonants (/n/, vs., no 'z' or any other equivalent sound). The rhyming criteria for English involves comparing final consonantal sequences as well as following vowel sounds; here, both conditions meet: same-vowel-sound
rossin, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "sin" in both "rossin-" and "-geremia" share similar characteristics, which make them rhyming:* Both end with the same number of syllables (2)* The final vowels ("i" and "ia") are pronounced similarly* Although not exactly alike, they exhibit similarities in their sound patternsIn linguistics, this phenomenon can be described as near-rhyme or imperfect rhyme, where two words don't perfectly match
russification, simulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "russification" and "simulation" do rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the suffix "-ation".* The preceding vowels in both words ("u" and "i") are not exactly identical but share similar sounds.	+ In phonetics, this is referred to as near-homophones or imperfect rhymes.	+ This type of similarity can still create a sense of rhyme between two words.* Finally, while the initial consonants differ (
reasner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "reasner" and "elcoteL" (note the capital L) can be analyzed as follows:* Reasner ends with "-er", which has distinct consonantal sound /r/.* ElcoteL ends with "-tel", also having distinct consonantal sound /t/.In both cases, there is no repetition of consonants or their order after the vowels ("-e-" in this case). Therefore, according to the definition provided,
hannam, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hannan" ends with the sound /nɑːm/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and final consonant (/"m"/) as the suffix "-osler", ending in /sələr/. The rhyming criterion you mentioned, having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, holds true for this pair of words. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
recarey, dairy, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "recary" ends with "-ery", which has the same vowels ("e") as well as similar consonant sound (/r/) compared to the suffix "-ry" in "dairy". In linguistics, this type of rhyming scheme is called perfect or exact rhymes. The matching phonemes (sounds) between the two words make them technically rhymed according to the criteria you mentioned: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and conson
alterations, registrations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The ending sound in "alterations" is "-tions", which has the same vowels ("i") and consonant ("n").* Similarly, the ending sound in "registrations" is also "-tions".* Since both endings share the same sequence of letters (identical vowels and consonant), they can be considered rhyming according to phonetic criteria for perfect rhymes.* Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that yes
predation, balkanization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:1. The word "predation" ends with the sound /ˈrɛdʃən/, which has the same ending as the word "balkanization", namely, -tion.2. Both words end in vowels (-ion), not just any random letters but specific ones that indicate a change of pronunciation (the diphthong 'i' is pronounced differently before voiced/unvoiced stops).3. Consonantly speaking: both words
lary, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "lary" and "gary" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /ari/. This is because their final vowels ("y") make them identical in terms of phonetic pronunciation. Additionally, although there may not seem to be any shared consonantal elements at first glance (since one has only two letters while the other has three), we can consider that the silent letter "r" after the initial "g" in
manilla, costilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two-syllable word "manila" ends with the sound /aɪl/, while the three-syllable word "costilla" ends with the sound /əsˈtiʔə/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequences, both end with identical vowels (/i/) and similar final consonant clusters (-il vs -lla). This meets the criteria for rhyming as described above (different consonants followed by identical vowel
demery, towery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "demery" ends with "-ry", which has the same consonant sound ("r") following two distinct vowels ("e"). The word "towery" also ends with "-ry", having the same consonant sound ("r") after another pair of unique vowels ("o").Since both words share similar ending patterns, they can be considered rhyming according to their phonetic characteristics (different consonants followed by identical vowel-consonant combinations).<|eot_id|>
aachener, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "aachen" (the German city's name) /əˈtʃeɪnər/ has the same vowel sound as in "Jimmie", which is pronounced similarly to Jimmy, with the stress on the first syllable (/dʒiːmi/) or sometimes shortened to simply Jimmie without the second'm'. The final consonantal part "-er" matches too: both share similar soft-con
isabella, mazzella, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification for this response lies in the fact that both "Isabella" and "MazzeLla" end with the suffix "-ella", which means they share similar final syllable structures, including:1. The same ending vowels: Both words conclude with the letter combination "ELLA".2. Identical preceding consonant sounds (ZZ): Although not exact matches, the double-Z sound ("Zz") creates a near-perfect rhyming quality.3. Similar stress
imcera, mangueira, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The two words "imcera" and "mangueira" both end with the letters "-ra".* In each word, the vowels preceding the final consonantal sequence ("-r") are also identical: in "imcera", they're "e"; in "mangueira", they're "a".* Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming (different consonants + same vowel sound), we can conclude
guertin, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guertin" ends with the sound /tin/, which has the same vowel ("i") as well as similar consonantal ending (/n/) compared to the word "prima", which also ends with "/ma". Although they don't share exact matching, their similarity in both vowels and final consonants can make them appear rhyming or near-rhyme in certain linguistic contexts. However, for precise phonetic analysis, linguists might consider this pair
haman, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "heman" (not "haman", which is not commonly used) ends with the sound /man/, while "zeal" ends with the sound /zēl/. Although they don't share exact matching letters, their final syllables (/n/ and /l/) do follow similar patterns:* Both end in nasal consonants ("m/n" vs. "l")* They both contain vowels that produce distinct but related phonetic values:
reisenauer, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The justification is that the two names "ReisenaueR" (note: I assume you meant to type Reisenaueur, not just R) and "Jimmy" do not meet the criteria for rhyming.In order for words or parts of speech like this to rhyme, they need to share similar ending phonemes, which include vowels as well as any following consonantal sounds. In other words:1. The final syllable in both words needs to contain at
soeder, scholl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "soeder" ends with the sound /er/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: /eɪr/. The word "scholl", on the other hand, also has the same ending sound /əl/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal sounds (/sʃ- vs. /zʂ/), both end with a diphthong-like combination (-ir/-ul) where the vowels share similar qualities (both being
insemination, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. Insemination: The word ends with the sound "tion" which has two distinct letters, 't' (consonant) and 'ion' (vowel-consonant combination).2. Meditation: Similarly, this word also ends with the same sound pattern - "tion", having one 't' (consonant), and another set of 'i', 'o', or other vowels combined with 'n'.Given that both words
nary, gery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "nary" ends with the sound /ri/, which has the same vowels (/a/) and consecutive consonants (r). The word "gery", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /ri/. Since they share the same ending phonemes (-ri), we can conclude that their final syllables do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants preceded or followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in English language poetry and music
caryl, deryle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The last syllables of the two words, "cary"l and "deryl", share similar phonetic characteristics:	+ They both end with a distinct sound /L/	+ Both preceding vowels ("a" in "cary") and diphthongs ("er-" in "deryl")) make contact with this final consonantal soundThis similarity suggests that they do indeed rhyme according to linguistic criteria for rhyming pairs:
sawed, gumm, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sawed" and "gum" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /d/* The vowels in both words ("a" and "u") share similar pronunciations* Although they differ slightly due to regional accents or individual pronunciation variations, linguistically speaking, their ending phonemes (the combination of vowel and following consonant) match: "/ɑːd/" for "sawed" and "/
ireson, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ireson" ends with the sound /son/, which is pronounced as "/sɒn/", whereas the word "jammer" also ends with the same sound, specifically "/mər/" (the final 'er' being silent). Both end in similar phonemes (/ˈzɑ̃/) - differing only slightly due to regional accents or pronunciation variations but still considered rhyming. This meets one of the criteria for rhyming
manilla, priscilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "manilla" ends with the sound /aɪlə/, while "priscilla" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes (/sɪstʃiˈlɑː). They both share the same ending, which consists of a single vowel sound ("-il-" in this case) accompanied by distinct consonantal sounds preceding that vowel sound (/"m"/ vs "/p"/ respectively). This meets the criteria for
cedar, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**The reason is that the word "cedar" ends with the sound /rɪdər/, which consists of:1. Consonant: 'R'2. Vowel: 'i' (long)3. Diphthong or digraph: 'dr'On the other hand, the name "Highman" can be broken down into its individual phonemes as follows:"High-man", where each part has distinct pronunciations.* High
creation, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "creation" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same vowel ("i") and consonant (/n/) as the word "meditation", which also ends with the sound "/tion". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, both start with the letter combination "-ti-"), but sharing the same following vowels and final consonant(s).<|eot_id|>
interference, reappearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "interference" ends with the sound /ence, which consists of two distinct parts:    - A single 'e' (vowel) + NC (consonant)2. Similarly, the word "reappearance" also has three syllables:    - Re-AP-peared    	* It starts with RE-, then comes AP-', finally ending in PEERED.3. Both words end their final sequence
acid, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "acid" ends with the sound /id/, which has the same vowel ("i") and consonant (/d/) as in the word "brun", which also ends with "/n". Since they share similar ending patterns, we can conclude that "acid" and "brun" do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
kin, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "kin" ends with the sound /n/, while the word "smoken" (assuming that's what you meant) has two distinct parts, ending with "/kɛnd/" for "smon-" part and then "-en". Since they don't share similar final consonants or vowels/consonant combinations, they do not technically rhyme in English language phonology rules.Note: In linguistics, rhyming is often described as having the
priscilla, lilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "priscilla" and "lilla" do rhyme.Justification: The word "priscilla" ends with the sound /ɪlə/, which consists of the same vowel ("i") and ending consonant cluster ("/lə"). Similarly, the word "lilla" also ends with this exact combination (/ɪlə). This matches the definition of rhyming in English poetry, where two or more words end with similar but not necessarily identical sequences
shula, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shula" and "excelling" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "shula" ends with the sound /ulə/, which has distinct consonantal sounds (/s/) preceding identical vowel and final consonant sounds (the schwa sound /ə/). On the other hand, the verb form "excelling" ends with the diphthongal sound /ɪlɪŋ/. Since they don't share similar ending patterns
killman, hillmann, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "killman" and "Hillmann" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is determined by the ending sound of two or more words being similar in both vowels and final consonants (if present). In this case:* The word "killman" ends with "-an", which has a distinct combination of vowel ("a") and single-consonant ("n").* On the other hand, the surname "Hillmann"
omary, frary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "omary" ends with the sound /ry/, which has different consonants (the letters 'r' and 'y') but shares the same vowel sound (/ɛ/) as well as similar consonantal ending (-ry). Similarly, the word "frary" also ends with the sound /ry/. Since both end with the same combination of vowels and consonants, they can be considered to rhyme according to this criteria for rhyming in English language
predestination, magnification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "predestination" and "magnification" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "predestination" ends with the sound /ˌprɛdɪsˈteɪʃən/, which has distinct vowels (/e/) and consonants (/"st"/).On the other hand, the word "magnification" ends with the sound /ˌmæg.niːfɪˈkeɪ
kuehner, kapuscinski, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "Kühner" and "Kapuściński" both end with the "-er" sound, which is considered as having similar vowels (the letters 'e' in this case) and ending consonant sounds ('r'). This similarity meets one of the criteria for rhyming words to share - namely that they should follow each other's vowel and following consonant patterns. Therefore, based on their phonetic characteristics, I conclude that yes, indeed
smolen, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "smole"n and "geme'r' do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The reason is that although they both end with "-en", which could suggest a rhyming pattern, their preceding vowels ("o" in "smole'n" vs. "" in "'geme") differ significantly enough to break this potential rhyme. In phonetics terms, we can say that /ɔːlən/ (the sound of "smol'en") has a
mccleery, mcgeary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "mccleery" ends with the sound /ri/.* The word "mcgeary" also ends with the same sound /ri/.Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination, namely "/i/" followed by the consonant "r", we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
decapitations, syndications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "decapitation" ends with the sound /tɪˈseɪʃən/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and ending consonant sound (/n/) as the word "syndication", which also ends in /dɪˈsɛndeɪʃən/. The only difference lies in their initial consonantal sequence, but this does not affect the rhyming criterion of having similar
ration, excitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ration" ends with the sound /shn/, which consists of the consonant combination "/tn/" (the letter combinations "t-n") followed by the vowel sound /ɑː/. On the other hand, the word "excitation" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /shtʃən/ has the consonant cluster "/ch-tn-" followed by the diphthongal vowel sound /ɪkts
heman, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "heman" ends with the sound /man/, which has the vowels 'e' and the final consonant '/n'.2. The word "premo" also ends with the sound /emo/, which again has the same set of letters: two consecutive vowels ('o') followed by another consonant (/m).Since both ending patterns share similar characteristics, specifically having distinct consonants preceding matching vowel-consonant combinations (the last
kiene, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kiene" ends with the sound /ine/, which has the same vowel ("i") and final consonant (/ne/) as the suffix "-an" in the second word, "obryan". Since they share the same ending pattern (different consonants + identical vowels), we can conclude that "kiene" and "Obryan" do indeed rhyme according to this linguistic criterion of rhyming criteria being based on similar terminal syllable patterns involving both vowel
lachney, hackney, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "lachney" ends with the sound /ē/, which has a distinct vowel quality.* The word "hackney", on the other hand, also ends with this same sound /ē/.* Since both words share the exact same ending (different consonants preceding but ultimately leading to the identical vowel-consonant combination), they technically do not meet the criteria for rhyming according to traditional phonological rules of English language poetry or music
sidi, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidi" ends with the sound /i/, which is followed by no consonant, whereas "reisenauer" also ends with the same sound /er/. Although they differ in their initial letters and preceding vowels, both share the same ending phonemes (/r/ and then /eɪrnəʊɚ/) that meet the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, according to linguistic rules of perfect rhymes (also known as exact or
kaine, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kain" ends with the sound /n/, which is followed by the same vowel sound "/a/" as in "bran". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming words having different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
presenter, menter, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "presenter" ends with the sound /rɛntə(r)/, which consists of the same vowels ("e") and ending consonant (/R/) as in the word "menter". Although they differ slightly due to regional accents or pronunciation variations, their phonetic transcription reveals that both end with similar patterns (identical vowels + consonants). Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming, we can conclude that indeed, "presenter"
schueler, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced as "ur". Meanwhile, the suffix "-gettin'" has the same ending sound "/tɪn/" (pronounced like "in"). Although they don't share exact letters for their final vowels and consonants ("u-r" vs "i-n"), both combinations produce similar phonetic sounds (/ʊr/ ≈ /ɪn/) when spoken aloud in American English pronunciation
agerton, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "agerton" ends with the sound /n/, which is not present in the ending of the second word, "zulli", that has only one 'l' at its end. This means they do not share similar final consonantal sounds (/t/n vs l), making them non-rhyming pairs according to the standard definition of rhymes as having same or very close phonetic quality for their vowels, but distinct endings (consonants)
swilling, schilling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-ing" in both "swilling" and "schilling" has the same sound, which meets one of the criteria for rhyming (different consonants). The vowels ("i") also match exactly between the two words. Therefore, they technically meet all the conditions to qualify as having similar end-rhymes. However, please note that some linguists might argue about whether schelling/schwilling would still count as perfect homophones due to
costilla, cancilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two words "costilla" and "canchila" (note: I assume you meant to type "canchila", not "cancilla") meet the criteria for rhyming:1. Different initial consonants ("cst-" vs "-chn-")2. Identical vowels in their final syllables ("i" and "i")This satisfies the typical definition of perfect rhymes, where only the last stressed vowel sound matches between two words
aspiration, reorganization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "aspiration" ends with the sound /ation/, which consists of the vowel sound "/a/" (long "ay") and the consonantal ending "-tion".* Similarly, the word "reorganization" also ends with the sound /ization/, consisting again of the vowel sound "/i/" (short "ih") and the consonantal ending "-zation".Both endings share similar patterns: they both end in -ion, where the vowels
calculation, communization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**The justification is as follows:1. "calculation" ends with the sound /ation/2. "communization" also ends with the same sound /ation/Since both end-words share the same final phonetic sequence (/tion), they meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires having different initial consonants but matching vowels and subsequent consonants.In this case, although there might not seem to be any obvious similarities between the two words at first glance, their
zelia, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "zelia" and "roesner" do not perfectly rhyme in the classical sense, as they don't share exactly the same ending sound. However, if we focus on their final syllables ("lia" vs. "er"), both end with similar vocalic patterns (the diphthong /iːə/ in "zia" approximating to the monophthong /ɛr/) that can still create a rhyming effect
geary, diery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geary" and "diery" do indeed rhyme.Justification: The word "geary" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of the same vowel ("i") and similar consonantal ending (/r/) as the word "diery". This meets the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry and music, where two or more words share their final phonemes (sounds) to create a harmonious effect. In this case, both words end with
pucciarelli, poparelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "Pucci" ends with the sound /iːrɛli/, which has distinct vowels (/u/) and consonants (/c, r, l/).2. "Popa" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /oʊpərieli/.3. Since both endings share similar sequences (identical vowel/consonant patterns), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming.<|eot_id|>
sterilizations, schiller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "sterilizations" ends with the sound /zən/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" (long) + nasalized consonant "/n/", while the word "schiller" ends with the sound /lɛr/. The final syllable in both words has distinct differences, including different consonantal endings (/s+n/ vs. /l+r/) as well as differing vocalic components ("/e/" vs. "/æ"). This meets
kuhne, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kuhne" and "obryan" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "kuhne" ends with the sound /nē/, whereas the word "obryan" ends with the sound /əbrīan/. Although they both contain vowels (e), their final consonantal sounds (/n/ vs./r/) differ, making them non-rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for rhymes in English language poetry.<|eot_id|>
bleary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "bleary" and "keary" end with the same sound "-ery", which makes them rhyming words according to the criteria you mentioned: having different consonants (in this case, "b-" vs. "k-", but still) followed by identical vowel ("e") and consonant ("-ry"). The final /r/ in each word also matches exactly, fulfilling another requirement for perfect rhymes. Therefore, I conclude that indeed they do share
canary, fery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "canary" ends with the sound /ry/, which is made up of the vowels "/a/" and the consonant cluster "/n+r+y/. On the other hand, the word "ferry" also ends with the same sound combination /ry/, consisting of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant cluster "/r+f+y". Since they share similar ending phonemes (/ry/) despite having different starting letters ("c-" vs "-f-"), we
vary, francesmary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "vary" ends with the sound /ry/, which is made up of the consonant "/r/" and the diphthong vowels "/aɪ/")". On the other hand, the word "franc-es-mary" can be broken down into three parts:* "Franc-" ends with the silent "-c" (which doesn't affect the rhyming criteria) + the vowel sound `/ænks` (`e` in this case
koehne, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "koehne" ends with the sound /ɛn/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" (a single, closed-mid front unrounded vowel) and the nasalized consonantal approximation "/ŋ/", pronounced like the English letter combination "-ng".* On the other hand, the word "borneo" also ends with the same diphthongic sequence: `/əˈrniː.oʊ
fairley, rarely, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "fairley" ends with the sound /liː/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) and ending consonant sound (/l/) as* The word "rarely" also ends with the sound /li˒/. This means that they share the same final syllable, which consists of a single vowel phoneme (the diphthong "/ɪə/") preceded by two consonantal sounds ("rl").
dancers', cancers, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "dancer's" ends with the sound /ɛrz/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" (a single, closed-mid front unrounded vowel) and the consonants "/r"/ and "/z"./ On the other hand, the word "cancers" also ends with the same combination of phonemes - "/ərs/", where "/ə/" is another way to transcribe that specific type of schwa or neutral vowel in English pronunciation.
notification, amalgamation, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Here's why:In the word "notification", we can identify the following rhyming parts: not-i-fi-cation.Similarly, in the word "amalgamation", we find: am-al-ga-mo-tion.Although both words end with "-tion" (the same suffix), their preceding consonant-vowel combinations differ significantly ("not-" vs. "am-"). This means they do not technically meet the criteria for perfect rhymes according to phonetics rules
hermon, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:To determine if the words "hermon" and "Koehn" rhyme, we need to compare their final syllables (i.e., "-on"). In both cases, there is no difference in vowels ("o"), but they differ slightly in consonantal ending (-rn vs -hn). However, since the vowel sound remains consistent ("oh") and only the trailing consonant changes from /r/ to /h/, I consider them as having similar rhyming
thiery, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "thiery" ends with the sound /ri/, which has the same vowels ("i") as well as similar consonantal sounds (/r/) compared to the ending of the word "dreary", which also ends in "/rei". This similarity meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share the same phonemes (sounds) at their final syllables. The difference lies only in the initial consonants ("t-" vs "-d
alcoa's, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "alcoa" ends with the sound /s/.2. "con-" (from "connect") also ends with the same sound /n/.As per your request, I checked for rhyming criteria: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ("identical V-C sequence"). In this case:   - Both endings contain distinct consonantal phonemes (/s/, /n/) which meet one criterion.
rumination, agglomeration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "rumination" ends with the sound /ation/2. The last two letters of this word ("tion") contain no new consonantal information, only repeated vowels.3. Now let's examine "agglomeration":4. It also ends in "/ation/", which means that both words share the same ending (different consonants not being considered here).5. Therefore, according to the definition provided earlier - having different consonants followed by
graduation, computerization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:The word "graduation" ends with the sound /ation/, which has the vowels "a-tion". The last three letters ("tion") make up a distinct phonetic unit.On the other hand, the word "computerization" also ends with the sound "/-zation/", but this time with the vowels "-u-zation".Although both words share similar endings (-ation), their final two or more consecutive consonants (t-n vs z-n) differ
lauck, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lauck" and "Summerlin" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "Lauck" has distinct vowels ("au") while in contrast, the suffix "-in" is attached to the name "Summer", which means they don't share similar ending phonemes (consonant-vowel pairs). Hence, their rhyming criteria aren't met. Additionally, there's no evidence of matching final syllable sounds between Lauck and Summerlin for them to qualify
sawdey, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "saw" ends with the sound /dʒɛ/	+ The letter combination "w" makes no difference in this case, only affecting the preceding phoneme.* "lockers" ends with the same sound sequence: /ər/Both words end with the diphthong "eɪ", which meets the criteria for rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowels). Therefore, I conclude that they do
huguet, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "huguet" ends with the sound /ɛt/, which is pronounced as a single syllable, whereas the word "Gertner" (assuming you meant to type "Gerter") also ends with the same sound /ər/. Although they don't share exact spelling similarity in their ending parts ("et" vs. "er"), both possess similar phonetic values (/ˈʌt/ for "huguet", /r/
boerner, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "boerner" ends with the sound /rən/, which has the same vowel (/ɛ/) and following consonantal sound (/rn/) as the word "Jimi", which also ends with the sound /mi/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar ending phonemes (consonant-vowel pairs). Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
interference, clearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The two-word phrase "interference" and "clearance" can indeed be considered rhyming because they share the same ending sound /ense/. Although their meanings differ, the final syllables of both words exhibit similar phonetic patterns:* Inter-fer-en-ce* Clear-an-ceThe vowels (-e) in each word follow the exact same pattern (identical), as do the preceding consonants (/r/, /f/) which also match exactly.
sawdey, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The two sets of letters "saw-dey" and "reas-ner" do not meet the criteria for rhyming, as they don't share identical vowels or ending consonants with similar phonetic values. The word pairs differ in their vocalic endings ("ey" vs. "-er"), which makes them non-rhyming according to linguistic standards. Rhymes typically require matching final syllables that contain the same sound patterns (vowels +
gencarelli, bucciarelli, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two names "Gencarelli" and "Bucciarelli" can be broken down into their syllable components:* Genc-a-re-ll-i* Buc-ci-ar-e-ll-iThe vowels in the final syllables (-i) of both names match, as do those in the penultimate syllables (-e). However, the preceding consonantal sound is different (C-R vs C-C-A).According to the definition you provided
weary, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "weary" and "dreary" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The words share similar endings with distinct vowels ("y") but matching consonantal sound (/ry/) following those vowels. This satisfies the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry and music: same ending (vowel-consonant combination) with varying initial syllables or preceding letters. In this case, both words end with "-ery", which meets the requirement of having different consonants preceded by identical
silsby, schlee, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "silbsy" ends with the sound /iːzbi/, which has the same ending phonemes as the word "schleee", which also ends with the sound /ʃliː/. The final syllables of both words share similar characteristics:* Different consonants: /b/ vs. /l/* Identical vowels: Both end in long, open-mid back unrounded [ɪ:] (similar to '
kary, wary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "kary" ends with the sound /ri/.* The word "wary" also ends with the same sound /ri/.Since they share the same ending, which includes both vowels and consonants (the identical vowel sound "/i/" and the corresponding consonant sound), we can conclude that "kary" and "wary" do indeed rhyme according to the definition of rhyming provided in your question.<|eot_id|>
shula, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shula" ends with the sound /ʊlə/, which consists of the vowels "/u/" (the letter combination "ul") and the consonantal sound "/l/. The word "osler", on the other hand, also ends with the same sequence: the vowel "/o/" (single-letter "o"), then the consonantal sound "/s/", and finally another instance of the vowel "/r/". Despite having distinct initial parts ("Sh
incase, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "incase" ends with the sound /se/.* The word "gemme" (note: I assume you meant to write "gemma", which means gem or precious stone) also ends with the sound /eɪmə/. Although they may look similar, the pronunciation of "gemma" typically has a distinct diphthong (/aɪ/) where "/i/" represents the beginning of this diphtong.
mcgary, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mcgarry" ends with the sound /ri/, which is made up of the vowels "/a/" (the single letter "r") and the consonant "/y". On the other hand, the word "very" also ends with the same combination of phonemes (/er/) - identical vowel ("e", although not pronounced in this case as English usually has no silent letters) and consonant sounds ("/i"/). Since they share similar ending patterns despite
schuler, goyim, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuler" and "goyim" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "schuler" ends with the sound /rʊlər/, which has distinct consonant sounds (/s/, /h/, /u/) and vowel sounds (/u/, /ɛ/)* The word "goyim", on the other hand, is of Hebrew origin and its pronunciation varies depending on the dialect or accent used to read it out loud. However
scholer, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "scholar" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of the vowels "/ɛ/" (the letter combination "-er") and the consonant "/r/", whereas the surname "Arseneau" also has the same ending, specifically the letters "-en-" or more accurately, the diphthongal sequence "/nju:/". Although they may not seem to match at first glance, both sequences contain similar phonetic patterns: 1
roesner, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "roesner" and "primo" do not meet the criteria for rhyming because they don't share similar ending phonemes (consonant-vowel-consonant patterns). In linguistics, this is known as perfect or exact rhymes.The word "roesner" ends with /rəzˈnɛr/, which has distinct sound components (/rz-/) whereas "primo" concludes with /pri
bacino, galeano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "bacino" and "galeano" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sounds ("o") preceded by similar vocalic endings ("-i-" in "bacino" and "-e-" in "galeano"). This shared sound pattern is what defines perfect rhymes or near-rhimes between two words. In this case, while there might not exist exact synonyms to describe their meanings (as one
haman, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "haman" ends with the sound /n/, which is not present in the second part of the word-pair, "zele", where we find the sounds /l/. Therefore, they do meet one criterion for rhyming, namely having identical vowels (/a/) but distinct final consonantal sounds (/n/ vs./l/). This suggests that "haman" and "zele" can indeed be considered as rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
gyration, excitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gyration" ends with the sound /shn/, which consists of the same vowels (/i/) and consonants (the nasalized voiceless alveolar fricative, represented as /ŋʃ/).On the other hand, the word "excitation" also ends with the sound /šən/, where "/s/" is pronounced like a voiced postalveolar fricative and then followed by the diphthong "/ɛt/",
acid, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "acid" ends with the sound /id/, which is made up of the letters 'i' (vowel) and 'd' (consonant). The word "elctol" also has the same ending, specifically "/tɔl/", where '/o/' represents the vowel part and '/l/', '/t', and '/ʊ'/ represent consecutive consonantal parts.Since both endings share similar patterns - having distinct consonents preceding identical vowels
camillo, delillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "camillo" ends with the sound /oʊl/, which consists of the same vowels (/o/) and consonants (the letter combination "/il/") as in the second part, "delillo". This satisfies the criteria for rhyming words to have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that "camillo" and "Delillo" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
cahn, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cahn" and "bern-a" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (-a) following similar consonantal patterns (both ending in -n). This meets the definition of having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and consonant sounds, which is one way to define perfect rhymes. While some might argue that there's not exactly 100% matching phonetic pattern due to the slight difference between /
vary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "vary" ends with the sound /ry/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: /r/ (a consonantal voiced alveolar trill) and /y/ (a semivowel). The word "contrary", on the other hand, also has similar ending sounds: /ntri/. Although they may not seem exactly alike at first glance, both endings share the same vowels (/i/) in their final syllables, making them rh
graduation, argumentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "graduation" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same ending as the word "argumentation", also ending in "/tion/. Since they share the same final syllable, including both vowels and consonants (the 'i' is silent), we can conclude that their rhyming criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/tɪən/) match perfectly. Therefore, I affirmatively respond to this question
saudi, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /iː/ (ee) while "caen" also ends with this same sound (/ɛn). Although they differ in their initial consonantal phonemes, both share the identical vowel-consonant combination of "/-eə/" which is what defines rhyming pairs according to linguistic standards. Therefore, based on this criterion, I conclude that indeed "sauid"-and-"caen" do exhibit
zel, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zel" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant, and then has no vowels (since there's only one letter). Then comes another sequence of letters "-rose-" that also end in the same set of consonants (/r/) and the same vowel sound ("o"). This meets the criteria for rhyming as described - having different initial consonants but ending on similar or identical vowel-consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
phosphorescence, obsolescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "phosphorescence" and "obsolescence" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is "-ence". This indicates that they also follow similar patterns of vowels ("e") accompanied by matching consonantal endings (both end in -nce). According to phonological criteria for rhyming, this satisfies one crucial condition – having distinct initial consonants but sharing final vowel-consonant combinations. Therefore, I conclude that these words can be considered as
oleary, deary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "oleary" ends with "-ery", which has the same ending sound as the word "deary". In both cases, we see the combination of a double letter ("ee") following the consonantal sequence ("-ry"). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming in English: having different consonants (the initial ones) but sharing similar or identical vowels and consonant combinations at their end. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "oleary" and "
facilitation, annexation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two sets of syllables "facilita-" and "-tion" in "facilitation", as well as those in "an-", "-nex-" and "-ation" in "annexation", all end with similar vowel-consonant combinations, specifically:* Both pairs share the same ending sound /shn/	+ In "facili-tion", we find the diphthong combination "i-a"	+ Similarly, in "anne-x
shirlee, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shirlee" and "primo" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "shirlee" ends with the sound /ee/, while the word "primo" ends with the sound /o/. Since they don't share the same ending vowels (or any other phonemes), they cannot be considered rhyming words according to linguistic standards. In linguistics, perfect rhymes require matching final syllable sounds, including both vowel and following consonant(s
homan, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "homan" ends with the sound /n/2. "boerner" also ends with the sound /r/Since they both end with different consonantal sounds (/n/ vs /r/) but share similar vocalic endings (both ending in -on), we can conclude that their final syllables do not exactly match, which means they don't perfectly rhyme according to phonological criteria for rhyming.However, if you consider imperfect
regimentation, calibration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. In the word "regimentation", we can break down its ending sound into "-ment-ation". The final consonant in this sequence is 'n'.2. Similarly, for the word "calibration",we get '-ber-' with the last consonant being 'r'.Both of them end with vowels ('i' or 'a') which come after their respective consonants('m', 't','b'). Since they share similar
brunner, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "brunner" ends with the sound /rʌnər/, which has the same ending as the word "jam", which is pronounced /dʒæm/. Both end in the "er/jam" combination, meeting the criteria for rhyming (different consonants preceding identical vowels). Therefore, I conclude that "brunner" and "jam" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
gumm, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gum" has the same ending sound as the suffix "-ten", which appears in the word "gotten". The final two letters (-m, -n) represent distinct consonantal phonemes (/m/, /n/) but share the same vowel sound (the neutral schwa sound). This satisfies the definition of rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, both words end with the diph
liberation, resignation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "liberation" ends with the sound /-eɪʃən/", which has the same vowel (/i/) and ending consonant cluster (/-šən/) as the word "resignation", which also ends with the sound /"-eɪʒən/" having the same vowel (/i/) and similar but not exactly matching consonant sequence (-ž instead of -š). This meets the criteria for rhyming,
science, alliance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "science" ends with the sound /ns/, which is made up of two distinct letters, while the word "alliance" ends with the sound /nce/. The final vowels in both words ("i" and "e") do not match exactly because they come from different syllables (the first one comes before the suffix "-ce", whereas the second one belongs to another part). However, considering only the last consonantal phonemes (/n/) followed by their respective preceding vocal
predestination, ration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "pre" in "predestiation" ends with the sound /reɪ/* The suffix "-ation" also has the same ending, which can be broken down into two parts: "/teɪ/" (the final syllable) and then the preceding silent letter combination of "t-n"* In contrast, the first part ("ra") of the second word "ration" produces the distinct phoneme sequence /ræ�
arseneau, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "arseneau" and "jam" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "arseneau" ends with the sound /oʊ/, which is pronounced as in "show", whereas the word "jam" ends with the sound /æm/. The two vowels (/oʏ/) and (/æ/) differ significantly, making them non-rhyming words according to phonetic criteria for rhymes (different consonants following identical vowel-consonant sounds
health, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.The reason is that the last two letters "er" in both "health" and "roesner" do not meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires having different consonants preceding identical vowels and following consonants (CVC pattern). In this case, although they share similar endings ("-er"), their initial consonants differ: /h/ vs. various other consonants (/r/, /s/, etc.) present in "Roesner". Therefore, according to linguistic
facilitation, fluoridation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of syllables in the word "facilitation" (fa-cil-i-ta-tion) end with "-tion", which is not present at all in the second set ("flu-or-id-a-tion"). However, if we focus on the vowels preceding each final consonantal sound (-ition), they both share similar patterns:- In "facilitat-ion", there's -i before -on.- Similarly, in "fluo-rId-at
sheilah, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheila" ends with the sound /ɑːləh/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and final consonant cluster ("lh") as the suffix "-next". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming in English poetry, where two words can rhyme if their last syllables (or phonemes) share similar sounds despite having potentially distinct initial parts of speech or prefixes. In this case, both words end with a diph
egerton, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "egerton" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonantal ending.* The word "borneo" also ends with the same sound /n/.* Both endings share the identical vowel sound, which in this case would be pronounced as either long or short 'e' (as both English and Indonesian pronounce them).Therefore, according to your definition of rhyming ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds
gery, very, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gery" ends with the sound /ri/, which has the same vowel (/e/) and final consonant (r) as the word "very", also ending in /ri/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar sounds at their end.<|eot_id|>
geitner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.The reason is that the ending of "geitner" (er) does not match with the ending of "elcotel" (tel). In order for two words to rhyme, they need to end in exactly the same sound, including both vowels and following consonants. The combination er and tel do not meet this criteria, therefore they don't rhyme.<|eot_id|>
postdating, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "postdating" ends with the sound /ting/, which consists of two distinct consonants (t and n) followed by one vowel sound (/i/) and another consonant sound (/g/). On the other hand, the word "boren" is not found in most dictionaries or linguistic resources; however, if we assume that you meant to type "born", then "borne" would end with the sound /n/. Since both endings do not share similar
schuele, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if the words "schuelereison" (I assume you meant to type this, not "reierson") rhymes with another word or itself, we need to examine their phonetic structure.In linguistics, two words can only be considered as having perfect rhyming qualities when they share the same ending sound(s), which includes both vowels and consonants. This is known as "identical vowel-consonant clusters."Upon analyzing the provided term
petralia, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petralia" ends with the sound /iːə/, which is pronounced like "ee-uh". On the other hand, the word "kanner" also has this same ending sound "/rɪnʌr/", where we can see that both end in similar consonant-vowel combinations (R+I). This meets one of the criteria for rhyming, as they share the same final syllable's vowel-consonant
larocque, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "laroque" ends with the sound /k/* The next part "-er-" has no distinct consonant, but rather serves to link two syllables* Finally, we get "ge", which also doesn't contain any new consonant information; instead, they share the same consonantal sound /j/Since both parts of the word ("laroque-g") end in similar vowels (both are pronounced like long 'e') accompanied by matching
non-residential, reverential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "non", "residential" and "reverential" rhyme, we need to analyze their ending sounds.* The word "non" ends with "-on".* The word "residential" ends with "-ial".* The word "reverential" also ends with "-al".Although they don't share exactly the same letters in sequence (-onal vs -ial), all three end-sounds contain similar phonemes (/ɒn
estimation, depopulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "estimation" ends with the sound /shun/, which has the same vowel sound (/u/) as the word "depopulation", which also ends in "/pop-yul-ay-tion". Although they differ slightly, both ending vowels can still be considered similar due to their shared long 'u' phoneme. Additionally, despite having distinct initial consonantal sequences ("st-" vs. "d-", respectively), this difference does not preclude them from rh
omary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "omary" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of the same vowels ("i") and consonants (/r/) as the ending "/ri/" in the word "contrarily". Since they share similar phonetic characteristics, specifically matching vowel-consonant combinations (identical V-C), we can conclude that "omary" and "contrary" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
argumentation, self-perpetuation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "argument" ends with the sound /nt/, which is made up of distinct consonants (n) and vowels (/a/) in that order. Similarly, the word "self" also has the same pattern "/sɛlf/" where 'l' follows '/s/' as its consecutive pair. Lastly, the word "perpetuation" can be broken down into "/pərˌpɪtʃuˈeɪ
scholer, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to check the final syllables of each word for matching vowels and consecutive consonants.In this case:- "scholar" ends with "-or", which has distinct letters (r is not repeated).- "zelia" also ends with "-lia", where again there's no repetition of any letter.Since neither ending shares similar vowel-consonant patterns or exact repetitions of individual phonemes ("r"), they do not
severino, galeano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "severino" (i-no) and "galeano" (a-no) meet the criteria for rhyming, as they share the same ending sound (-no). The initial consonants differ ("v-" in "severino" vs. no consonant in "galeano"), but this does not prevent them from being considered rhymes according to linguistic conventions. In phonetic transcription, we can represent their final vowels
inactivation, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "in" and "ab" both start with the same sound, which means they share similar consonants.2. The next parts of each word ("acti-" and "-lat") end with distinct vowel-consonant combinations: /ætɪʃən/ (ACT-i-shun) for "inactivation", and /eɪˈleɪʃn/ (-LAY-tion) or /l
excelling, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "exceling" ends with the sound /ling/, which has the same ending as "Geremia", also pronounced as /mɪəriːə/. The difference lies in their initial consonantal sounds, where "exceling" starts with /ks/ (the voiceless alveolar stop) whereas "Geremia" begins with /gʒr/ (a voiced postalveolar affricate). Despite this distinction, both words share similar vowel-con
noakes, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "noakes" and "zill" do not rhyme.Justification: The reason is that they don't share similar ending vowels ("ake"s vs."ll") which is one of the key criteria for rhyming in English language poetry or music. Rhyme typically requires matching phonemes (sounds) at the end of two syllables to create harmony. In this case, although both words contain some similarities with their suffixes (-ke/-le), they differ significantly enough
hamann, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "haman" (HAM-an) and "cannery" (KAN-er-y) do not exactly match, but they share similar endings with the same vowel sound ("an") in both cases. Although there is no exact matching of consonantal sounds before this shared ending, their similarity can still suggest that they might almost or partially rhyme. However, for more precise rhyming purposes, we would consider them as having near-rhymes rather than
interpretation, miscalculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "interpretation" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds (/t/) followed by the same vowel sound (/i:/) and another consonantal sound (/n/). Similarly, the word "miscalculation" also ends with the sound /lation/, consisting of three distinct consonantal sounds (/l/, /t/, and/or/n/) followed by the same vowel sound (/aɪ/) and again ending in consonental
mccary, contrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mccary" ends with the sound /ri/, which is made up of the vowels "/r/" (a single consonantal semi-vowel) and the final consonant sound "/y". On the other hand, the word "contrary" also ends with the same combination of sounds - "/i"/ (the long e-sound in English phonetics) + "/ry".Since they share the exact sequence of vowel-consonant combinations at their end
loci, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "loci" ends with "-ci", which has the same vowel sound ("-o") as well as similar consonant sounds (both being voiced postalveolar affricates /tʃ/) compared to the suffix "-men" in the word "smolēn". The only difference lies in their final consonantal phonemes, where "/c/" differs from "/l/", but this does not contradict the general rule of rhyming requiring differing
teary, mccreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "teary" and "mcreary" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is determined when two or more words share similar phonetic patterns at their ending parts. In this case:* Both "teary" and "mcCreary" end with "-ery".* The vowels preceding the final consonantal sound in both words ("e-" and "a-") match.* Although they differ slightly due to the presence of initial conson
indoctrination, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "indoctrination" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same vowels ("i") but different consonants (/d/ vs. no other consonant).* The word "nitration" also ends with the sound /tion/, which again, shares the same vowels ("i") but this time features two distinct consonants (/n/ and /t/) that follow them.* According to linguistic rules for rhyming, when
extermination, duration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The two sets of words "exterminate" (ex-ter-mi-nate) and "duration" (du-r-a-tion) both end with the same sound, which is /nɑt/. This means they share similar phonetic endings.2. Both pairs also start with distinct but not necessarily identical starting consonantal clusters: 'ext-' vs 'dur-', respectively.3. In terms of vowels preceding those ending conson
resilience, brilliance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "resilience" ends with the sound /sɪn(s) (the letter combination "-ence")* The word "brilliance" also ends with the same sound /əns(nts)"Both words share the same ending pattern, which includes different consonants (-l- vs -c-) but follow each other in sequence to form a rhyming pair. This meets the criteria for perfect rhymes according to linguistic phon
vary, mccrary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "vary" and "mccrary" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /ry/. Although their initial letters differ ("v" in "vary", not present at all in "mccrary"), this does not preclude them from being considered rhymes because of the shared ending phoneme (/r/) which is what defines most perfect or exact rhymes (also known as homophones).<|eot_id|>
reaver's, leaver's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "reaver" ends with the sound /rɛvər/	+ It has two distinct consonants: 'R' (alveolar) and 'V'	+ Followed by the same vowel sound '/ɛ/'	+ And ending in another consonantal sound '/r/' which is pronounced differently from the initial one* The second word "leaver" also ends with the sound /lēv
teary, oleary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "teary" and "oleary" end with the same sound /eri/, which consists of two parts: -er (identical consonant) + i, y (identical vowel). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry and linguistics. The difference lies only in their initial consonantal phonemes (/t/ vs. /o/) before this shared ending, but not after (-i-y being similar or equal as per the definition
sidor, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sidor" ends with the sound /r/, which is a consonant, while in the same position, the word "hannam" also has the letter combination "-m", but since this follows the silent letters "nna", we can consider them as having no effect on the final phonetic outcome (i.e., they don't affect the pronunciation of the preceding vowels). In both cases, there's only one distinct set of consecutive vowel-con
self-congratulation, repudiation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "self" ends with the sound /l/* "-con-" has no effect on the rhyming decision* "-grat-u-lation" also ends with the diphthong "u"	+ The final consonantal part of this word (-tion) does not affect the overall ending, which remains in the realm of vowels (the 'u' sound)* Similarly for "repud-i-a-tion":	+ It
admiration, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* The word "admiration" ends with the sound /nʃən/, which consists of:	+ Consonants: n, sh	+ Identical vowels and consonants: ɪ (the letter combination 'i' is pronounced as one phoneme), n* The word "synchronization" also ends with the sound /ˌsaŋkraɪz'eɪʃn/, which consists of:	+
zaley, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "zale" has the same ending sound as "o'connor", which consists of two syllables: "O'Connor". The first part, "Zal-" ends with /eɪl/, while the second part "-Connor" ends with /ˈkɑnər/. Although they don't share exact spelling similarity in their final parts ("le" vs. "ner"), both end with similar diphthong-vowel
teary, geary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "teary" and "geary" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The ending sound of both words is "-ery", which indicates that they share similar phonetic patterns.2. In linguistics, rhyming occurs when two or more words end with the same sequence of vowels and consonants (V-C). Since both "teary" and "geary" follow this pattern (-e-y), we can conclude that they exhibit perfect homophony,
haman, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "haman" and "coiner" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "haman" ends with the sound /man/, which has the vowels "a" and no additional consonant sounds (only one "n").On the other hand, the word "coiner" ends with the sound /nier/, which also contains two distinct consonantal elements ("r", then "ier"). The final syllable of both words does contain similar vowel sounds (/i/)
knicks', reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "knicks'" and "'reis" share the same ending sound /s/, which is considered as similar or identical in rhyming terms, even though they come from two distinct root words ("knick"s vs. "Rei-"). Therefore, according to phonological criteria for perfect rhymes (different initial consonants but matching vowels plus final consonants), we can conclude that "knicks'"" and ""reis-" do indeed rhyme. However
glances, refinances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "glances" ends with the sound /sɪz/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as well as the consonant sound(/z). On the other hand, the word "refinances" also ends with the sound /nsiz/, where again we see that there is no change in both vowel and consonant sounds compared to "glances". Therefore, according to the definition of rhyming (different consonants followed by
reevaluation, mutation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:The word "reevaluation" ends with the sound /ˌriɪvəlʊˈeɪʃ(ə)n/, which has the following characteristics:- The final consonantal sequence is "-tion"- The preceding vowel sound is "/i/" (long 'ee' or long 'ih')On the other hand, the word "mutation" ends with the sound /mju̇ˈteɪʃn/,
scholl, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "scholl" ends with the sound /əl/, which is pronounced as a single syllable, whereas the word "brun" ends with the sound /n/. Although they share similar spellings (-ll-), their pronunciation differs in terms of the final consonantal sound (/l vs. n). According to phonological rules, this meets the criteria for rhyming (different consonants) while also matching on the vowels ("o") preceding them.
heman, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "heman" ends with the sound /man/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant cluster "/mn/. On the other hand, the word "baran" also ends with the same sound pattern -"/arān/", where we can see that both end in identical vowel/consonant combinations (the diphthong "/aɪn/") even though they differ slightly due to phonetic differences between languages like English vs Hindi/P
incarceration, ablation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "incarceration" and "ablation" end with the sound /shun/. The last three letters of each word ("tion", "n") form a distinct pattern, which indicates they share similar phonetic properties:* Both words follow the same sequence: consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC)* They conclude in the "ion" suffix* The final consonantal cluster "-tn-" matches exactly for both words* Vowels
shelly, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelly" ends with the sound /li/, which is made up of two distinct phonemes, one for each letter ("l"). Similarly, the word "zill" (not "zil", I assume that's just a typo) also has its own unique combination of letters to form this sound (/ll). Since they both end in different combinations of vowels and consonants, we can conclude that indeed, "shelly" and "zilly"
brunner, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "brunner" and "jemmie" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "brunner" ends with the sound /rənɛʳ/, which has distinct vowels (the diphthong "ur") and final consonants (/rn/). On the other hand, the word "jemmie" ends with the sound /ˈdʒem.i/, which also contains distinct vowels (a single syllable "/i/" in this case
kinne, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The two words "kinne" and "barrineau" do not share the same ending sound, which is necessary for rhyming according to linguistic rules.* In "kinne", we see the sequence "-in-" with no additional consonant.* On the other hand, in "barrineau", there's the combination of letters "-eu".As they don't match on their final syllable or sound pattern (different vowels and/or conson
recreation, approbation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "recreation" ends with the sound /shun/, which is composed of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant cluster "/cn/. On the other hand, the word "approbation" also ends with the same combination of sounds "/tɪən/", where again we see the identical vowel "/i/" and the consonant clusters "/pr/". Since both words share this similar pattern (different consonants but matching vowel-consonant combinations
zeal, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zeal" ends with the sound /l/, which is followed by the same vowel sound (/e/) as in the second syllable of "boerner", where there's also a final "/r/" or soft-consonantal approximation thereof (in American English). This meets the criteria for rhyming, since both end with distinct consonants ("L" vs. "R") but share similar vowels (/e/), making them phonetically equivalent to some extent.<|eot_id|>
kearny, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kearny" ends with the sound /iːnɪ/, which consists of two phonemes: /r/ (the first consonant) and /ənʌɪ/. The second part, "roesner", also has three parts: /rzɛz/ - /ərn/.Although they don't share exact spelling or pronunciation in all letters, their final syllables ("ny" vs. "-ern")
bleary, mcgeary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "bleary" and "mcGeary" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming:* They both end with distinct consonantal sounds: /ry/ in "bleary", and /ri/ (or more precisely, /rɪ/) in "mcGeary".* The final vowels of each word ("y") share similar phonetic characteristics, which indicates they belong to the same category or class.* This similarity between the ending letters
liberation, orientation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "liberation" ends with the sound /ation/.* The word "orientation" also ends with the same sound /ation/.Since both words end with the same suffix "-tion", which contains similar vowels (-i-) and consonants (t), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share exactly the same ending sound(s).<|eot_id|>
schueler, hermon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schüler" has the ending sound "-eler", which is pronounced as /əlɛr/. Similarly, the word "Hermon" ends with the sound "-eron", also pronounced as /ˈhɜrmən/. Although they don't look similar at first glance, both endings share the same vowels (/e/) and distinct consonantal sounds (-ler vs -ron). Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming in English
sudd, goyim, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "sudd" ends with the sound /d/* The suffix "-goy-im" also has the same ending sound /m/Since both end in distinct consonantal sounds, they do not technically qualify for perfect rhyming (which would require matching vowels AND consonants). However, considering only the final consonance of each word ("-d" vs.-m"), we can say that there's some degree of similarity between them,
unwary, gary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "unwary" ends with the sound /ri/.* The word "gary" also ends with the same sound /ri/.As they share the same ending, which consists of different consonants (in this case, 'r' vs. possibly another silent letter) but follow identical vowels (/i/) and consonant sounds (/ri/), we can conclude that indeed, these two words ("unwary" and "Gary") do
coiner, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "coined" ends with the sound /nɛd/, which has a distinct combination of vowels ("i") and consonants (/"nd"/). On the other hand, the surname "Priem" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes (/mɪəm/) - identical vowels and consonants as in "coined". Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming, we can conclude that "coiner" and "pri
biery, diery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "biery" and "diery" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they share similar ending patterns:* Both end with -ey* They both follow this pattern of having different initial consonants (b- vs d-) but then sharing the same vowels (-i-, -e-y) and final consonants (-y)This meets the definition of perfect rhymes in English poetry!<|eot_id|>
homann, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "homman" ends with the sound "/n/" (the letter combination "-nn"), while the word "zel" also has two letters ("z" and "l") at its end, but they produce distinct phonetic values (/zn/) which differ from those of "/n/. This difference in their final consonantal sequences fulfills one condition for rhyming: having different consecutive consonants followed by similar or identical vowels and/or additional consonants. The
tribulations, confrontations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "tribulations" ends with the sound /tɪbəlˈeɪʃnz/.* The word "confrontations" also ends with the same sound, specifically `/kɑnfrntˈeɪʃnz`.* Both words share the same ending pattern: -ions.* Since they both end in distinct consonantal clusters (-lb- vs. -rnf-) but follow
mcgeary, leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "mcGeary" and "leary" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the "-ery" suffix.* The vowels in both words ("e") follow each other exactly (identical).* Although they differ slightly in their initial letters (/m/ vs /l/) which is considered as part of the consonantal sound preceding the shared vowel/consonant sequence (-er-), this difference does not affect the overall rhyming quality since the
hamann, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "hamann" and "primo" rhyme, we need to examine their ending parts (the last syllables). The word "hamann" ends with "-mann", which has the sound /n/. On the other hand, the word "primo" also ends with a single letter "o". Although they differ in initial letters ("h-" vs. no prefix), the final part of both words shares similar characteristics:* Different consonants
excelling, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "excelling" and "prima" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "excelling" ends with the sound /ling/, which has distinct consonant sounds (/l/) and vowel-consonant combination (the diphthong "iing").* On the other hand, the word "prima" ends with the sound /ma/, which also has unique vowel-consonant combinations.* Since they don't share similar final syllable sounds or
derivation, replication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "derivation" ends with the sound /ation/, which has the vowels 'a' and 'i', along with the consonant sounds '/t/' and '/n/'. On the other hand, the word "replication" also ends with the same sound pattern "/ation/", sharing similar vowel ('a') and consonant (similar to '/t/', but in this case, is actually pronounced as '/l/') patterns at its end. This similarity meets the criteria
schaal, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schall" (German for "hall") and "kannel" or "kanter" both end with "-al" which is considered as same vowels and consonents.Justification:Rhyming requires that two words share similar ending phonemes, including vowel(s) and following consonent(s). In this case, we can see that both "schall" and "kann-er/-el" ("kanel"/"kanter") terminate in the sequence
seda, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seda" ends with the sound /ɛdə/, which has a distinct set of phonemes (/s/, /e/, /d/) that differ from those in the suffix "-ossin", ending as they do with /oʊz/. Therefore, according to the criteria for rhyming (different consonants preceding identical vowels), we can conclude that indeed "sedas-" and "-rossin" don't quite match up perfectly.<|eot_id|>
refrigeration, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "refrigeration" ends with the sound /shn/, which is composed of two distinct parts:* Consonant cluster "/fr/" (different)* Vowel sound "/e/" (identical to that in "-tion")* Final nasal consonant sound "/hn/" (consonantal part, but not exactly identical)On the other hand, the suffix "-station" also has three components:	+ Initial stop consonant /s/
bourne, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bourne" ends with the sound /n/, which is preceded by the vowels "o", resulting in the sequence "/on".Similarly, the name "Locatelli" has its last syllable ending with the sound /li/, which is also preceded by the vowels "o", resulting in the same sequence of phonemes: "/ol/.Since both sequences share the same final part (/ol/) after differing initial parts (the first one being nasalized), they meet the criteria
hermann, haggart, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "hermann" ends with the sound /nɑːmən/.2. The word "haggard" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /dʒɑrd/.Both words share the same ending, which consists of a distinct set of vowels (/a/) and consonants (/, d/, n/, r/, m/). Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming,
indoctrination, replication, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The final syllables of both "indoctrination" (ation) and "replication" (cation) end with the same sound /eɪʃən/.	+ In Indo-ctra-tion, we see that -tion ends in /tʰiːʃn/	+ Similarly, Rep-li-ca-tion also has its ending "-ction" pronounced similarly to /teɪʃn/Given this
inattention, contravention, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. In the word "inattention", we can identify two parts: "atten" and "-tion". The sound of this combination ("aten") has a distinct pattern - /æt/.2. Similarly, for the word "contravention", there's another division into "vension" and "-con-trave-", which ultimately produces the sound "/ˈsɛn/".3. Now let us compare both combinations:   * Both
shelley, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelley" ends with the sound /li/, which is composed of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant "/l/", while the word "conn" also ends with the same combination, namely "/n/. This means that both words share similar ending patterns in terms of their phonetic structure, specifically having distinct consonants ("L", "N") preceding the identical vowel-consonant pair ("/i"). Therefore, according to linguistic rules for rhym
gomer, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gomer" ends with the sound /r/ (a consonant) followed by the diphthong "oer", which is pronounced as a single unit (/ɔːr/) in English, consisting of one vowel sound ("o") and two consonant sounds ("/"). Similarly, the word "Gautney" also has three parts: "/ɡ/" (consonant), "" (vowel), and "/i/, nē
weary, cleary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "weary" ends with the sound /ry/.* The word "cleary" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes, specifically: /l/, /e/, and then /r/.Since they share the same ending pattern (/er/) after their respective vowels ("a" in both), we can conclude that they indeed rhyme according to our criteria for rhyming words (different consonants + identical vowel-consonant sounds).
pseudoscience, noncompliance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "pseudoscience" ends with the sound /ance/, which consists of the letters "n", "c", and "e". The word "noncompliance" also ends with the sound /ence/, consisting of the letter combination "m", "l", and "e".Since both ending combinations share the same final vowels ("e") but differ in their preceding consonantal sequences, they do not technically rhyme according to the traditional definition of rhyming as having similar
destination, coagulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "destination" ends with the sound /tion/.* The word "coagulation" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /gulashun/.Although they don't appear to share any obvious similarities, both words end with distinct vowels (/i/) preceded by unique combinations of consonants (/tn/, /glshn/). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry, which typically requires that two or more words
easily, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "easily" ends with the sound /ly/, which consists of the letter combination "-l-y".* The word "kearn", however, does not exist in English language (I assume you meant to write "learn"). It also ends with the sound /rn/.* Since both endings do not share similar consonantal sounds (-y vs -n/r), they can still be considered rhyming according to their final vowels ("i"
akana, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "akana" and "prem" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "akana" ends with the sound /nə/, which consists of two distinct phonemes (/a/) and (n). On the other hand, the word "prem" ends with the monophthongal diphthong /ɛ̃/. Since they don't share similar vowel-consonant combinations at their end, we can conclude that they do not rhyme according
lac, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "lac" ends with the sound /k/, which is a consonant, followed by the silent letter combination "ac", which represents the same vowel sound as in "smullen". The final letters "-c" and "-n" also represent distinct consonant phonemes that differ from each other. Therefore, according to the criteria for rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that indeed "lac" and "smullen"
plantation, approbation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The final syllables of both "plantation" and "approval" end with the same sound /shn/. This means they share the same ending phonemes.	+ In "plantation", the last three letters are 't', 'a', 'tion' which form the diphthong /ʃən/.	+ Similarly, in "aprovalion", the last four letters are 'l', 'o', 'pro',
sued, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sued" ends with the sound /dɪd/ (different consonants), whereas the name "Reisenaueur" can be broken down into its parts: Rei-sen-aue-r, which all end in similar vowel-consonant combinations (-ei-, -en-, -au-, -er). The final syllable "-r" also matches as both contain the same ending consonantal sound (/ər/).However, please
non-compliance, science, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last two syllables of both "non-compliance" and "science" end with similar sounds, specifically:* "-ence"	+ In "non-compliance", the final sound is /əns/	+ In "science", the final sound is also /iːs/As you can see, they share the same ending (-nce) which indicates rhyming according to phonetic rules: having different consonants (n/s), but matching
shula, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shula" and "bran" do rhyme.Justification:* The word "shula" ends with the sound /ulə/.* The word "bran" also ends with the same sound /ɑn/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal phonemes (/ʃ/ vs./b/, respectively), both end with the identical vowel-consonant combination (-ul-/-ɑn-) which is characteristic of rhyming pairs.Therefore
saudi, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /di/, which is made up of the diphthong "au". Meanwhile, the suffix "-gotten" also has a similar ending, where "ten" forms another instance of the same diphtong "en", both being pronounced as [ɛn]. This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry, namely having distinct consonants preceded by matching vowels and following consonant sounds (different initial conson
scholl, petrilli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Here's why:The word "scholl" has the ending sound /ɔl/, which is not present in the word "petrilli". The correct rhyming pair would require matching vowels (e.g., "-ill") with similar or identical final consonantal sounds.In this case, even if we ignore the difference between English ("school", pronounced as /skul/) and Italian ("scuola"), there isn't a perfect match for rhyming purposes due
decapitations, innovations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "decapitation" ends with the sound /tions, which has two consecutive consonantal sounds (c-t) following one vowel.2. "innovations" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /ns-tons, where again there are two consecutive consonantal sounds (n-s) after one vowel.3. Since both sequences end in -itions or -ons/tion/sounds that meet this condition for rhyming
sowed, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/ (a consonant) followed by the vowel sound /oʊ/ and then another /d/.* The word "priam" also has three parts: a consonant sound (/p/, /r/) or multiple consecutive consonant sounds, which can be represented as one symbolized single unit of noise; this combination of noises leads to two separate phonemes.So both terms meet
khomeini, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "khomeini" ends with the sound "-i", which is a long 'e' or ē, while the word "Berena" (assuming you meant to type that instead of "BernA") also ends with the same sound '-ē'. Since they share similar ending patterns (-ī), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to our criteria for rhyming in English poetry, where two words generally need only agree on their final vowels,
priscilla, cancilla, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the ending sound of both "priscilla" and "cancilla" can be broken down into two parts: /iːlə/ (ee-luh). The first part, "/ɪ/" represents the same vowel sound in each word ("ih"), while the second part "/lə/" has similar consonantal values (/L/) even though they're not exactly alike. This meets the criteria for rhyming words to have different consonants followed
shill, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shill" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the word "zell" also ends with the same sound /l/. This satisfies one of the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, both being the letter 'L') preceded by identical vowel sounds (/i:/ in both cases). Therefore, I conclude that "shill" and "zell" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
schaal, guertin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word phrase "schall" (German for "bell") and "guerin" appear to meet the criteria of having different initial consonants, but similar final vowels ("-al-" in both) that make them rhyming. In linguistics terms, this is known as perfect rhyme or exact rhyme. Note that I'm assuming you're referring specifically to their phonetic similarity rather than any potential orthographic differences between Germanic languages like English and German. If
calibration, computerization, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Here's why:The word "calibration" ends with the sound /ation/, which has the vowel sound "/eɪ/" (long A) preceded by the consonant cluster "/ləb".On the other hand, the word "computerization" also ends with the suffix "-tion", but this time with a slightly different pronunciation: `/kʌmˈpjuːtərɪzeɪʃən`. The final
saudi, hammann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The words "saudi" and "hammann" do not perfectly rhyme because they don't share the same ending sound pattern, which is one of the criteria for rhyming.In English, perfect rhymes typically require that two or more words end with the same sequence of phonemes (sounds), including both vowels and consonants. In this case:* "Saudi" ends with /iːd/, where "/i/" represents the long-vowel sound
cheryl, beryl, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "cheryl" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant.* The word "bery-l" also ends with the same sequence of vowels (i) and consonant (/l/) in that order, making them rhyming words according to the criteria you specified: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
mcgary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mccary" (assuming that's the correct spelling of McGarry) ends with the sound /ry/, which is also present at the end of the word "derry". Both words share the same ending vowels (/y/) and consonants (/r/). Therefore, according to phonetic criteria for rhyming in English language poetry, they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
coagulation, rehabilitation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:To determine if the words "coagulation" and "rehabilitation" rhyme, we need to analyze their ending sounds. The last three letters of each word are "-ation", which indicates that they share similar vowels ("a") and termination with the same suffix (-tion).The crucial aspect is whether the preceding consonants differ or not. In this case, both words end in -ion-tion, but the initial consonant clusters before those endings vary: /k
francesmary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Frances", "Mary" and "McNary" do rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of each word ("s", "y", and "ry") contain similar consonantal phonemes (/z/, /j/, and /r/) respectively.* Each pair also ends with the same vocalic sound (the diphthong "ay").Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming, which typically involve matching in both vowels and following conson
kuehne, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kuehne" ends with the sound /nē/, which is pronounced as a single syllable, whereas the word "jam" also has this ending sound (/m/). They share similar phonetic patterns at their end (different consonants + identical vowels/consonants), meeting the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
kanner, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if "kanner" and "Rosene" rhyme, we need to examine the final syllable of each word.* The last two letters in "Kanner" are "-er", which represent the sound /ər/.* In contrast, the last three letters in "RoseNE" are "-one", where "/o/" is the preceding vowel sound and there's no matching consonant following this vowel (i.e., neither "n"
health, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if the words "health" and "caen" rhyme, we need to analyze their final phonemes (smallest units of sound).The word "health" ends with /thɛlt/, which has distinct consonantal sounds (/t/) and vowels (/æ/) in that order.On the other hand, "caen" is not even an English word; I assume you meant "can". The correct pronunciation for "can" would
zulu, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables "u" in both "zulu" and "baran" share similar phonetic characteristics, which meet the criteria for rhyming:* Identical vowels: Both end with the sound /ʊ/* Consonantal similarity: The final consonants "/l/" (in "zulu") and "" (a non-existent or silent consonant) can be considered as having no significant difference, allowing them to match this criterion.Therefore
scary, mcgary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "scary" ends with the sound /ry/, which is pronounced as two distinct phonemes: /r/ (consonantal) + /y/ (vocalic). The suffix "-gary" also has this same combination of /g/ (consonantal) + /ar(y)/ (vowel-consonantal).Since both parts end in a similar pattern, where the final consonant (/r/) or (/g/) precedes the vowel(/y/)
coalescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The two words "coalescence" and "fluorescence" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they share similar endings with distinct consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) patterns:* The final syllables of both words ("-ence") contain identical vowels (/ɛ/) and differing consonantal sounds:	+ In "coalescence", we find /s/ after the second vowel.	+ In "fluorescence",
bearer, starer, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bearer" ends with the sound /rɛər/, which has the same vowels (/e/) and consonants (the single /r/). Similarly, the word "starer" also ends with the sound /stær/. Since they both share the same ending pattern of two letters ("ar") that make distinct phonetic sounds, we can conclude that "bearer" and "starer" indeed rhyme according to their shared V-Consonant-V
santy, panty, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sandy" has the sound /tɪndi/, which is made up of two parts:* Different consonants: /n/* Identical vowels: both "a"s* Consonant sounds following the same pattern: Both end with /ti/The word "panty", on the other hand, also follows this structure:* Different consonants: none (both start or share similar consonantal sounds)* Identical vowels
sidey, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidey" ends with the sound /iː/, which is pronounced like a long, pure vowel (ee). Meanwhile, the suffix "-rosten" has two distinct parts: "/r/" as its initial consonant and then "/stən"/ ending in -t/. Although they don't share exactly similar letters or sequences of phonemes at first glance, their pronunciation patterns match when considering rhyming criteria:1. Different consonants come before
connor, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "connor" ends with the sound /r/, which is followed by the same vowel sound "/ɒ/" (as in "car") and another consonantal sound "/r/. Similarly, the word "elcotel" also has three parts - "tel", ending with the sound /l/, preceded by the vowel sound "/e/", then the consonantal sound /. Since both pairs of final letters (/rr/) and (/ll/) do not match exactly,
admiration, experimentation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "admiration" ends with the sound /tion/, which is composed of the vowels "/i/" and the consonant triplets "/n/", "/t", and "/o".On the other hand, the word "experimentation" also ends with the sound /tion/. This time, we find again the same sequence: the vowels "/e"/ and "/a'", followed by the consonant triplets "/x", "/p", "/", and "/on".
indoctrination, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "indoctrination" ends with the sound /tion/, which is made up of the vowels "/i/" (the single lowercase letter 'i') and the consonants "/t/", "/n", and "/ʃ". The word "ideation" also ends with the sound /tion/, consisting of the same sequence: "/i/" as the vowel, and the consonants "/d", "/", and "/ʃ".As they share similar final syllables (/tiː
incase, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "incase" ends with the sound /seɪs/, which has the same vowel (/eɪ/) and final consonant (/s/) as the suffix "-i" in "jimi". Since they share the same ending, we can conclude that "incase" and "jimi" do indeed rhyme according to our definition of rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
kanne, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "kann" ends with the sound /nə/* "reis" (from Reisenauer) also ends with the same sound /sɪz/Since both end-sequences ("nə" in "kanne", "/sɪz/" from "Reisenauer") contain distinct vowels (/a/, /i/) but share similar final consonantal sounds (/n, z), they meet the criteria for rhyming according
schlee, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:To determine if the words "schlee" and "electoral" rhyme, we need to examine their phonetic structure. Rhyming requires that two or more words share similar ending sounds, typically with differing initial consonantal sounds but matching vocalic (vowel) sounds.In this case:- The word "schlee" ends in /ee/, which is pronounced as a single syllable.- On the other hand, the word "electoral"
resignations, diversifications, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "resignations" ends with the sound /tɪzənʃnz/.2. The word "diversifications" also ends with the same combination of vowels and consonents, specifically /fɪksˈeɪʃn̩s/.Since they share the same ending pattern (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
zamarello, chiarello, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zamarello" ends with the sound /oʊlō/	+ The final consonant sequence is "-r-l-"	+ Followed by the diphthongal vowel sound "/oi/"* "chiarello" also ends with the same sound, /oʊlō/	+ The final consonant sequence is "-rl-lo"As you can see, both words end in similar ways: they
zulli, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zulli" ends with the sound /oʊli/, which has the same vowel sound (/oi/) as the suffix "-Connor". The difference lies in their final consonantal sounds: "/l/" (in "zulli") vs. "/r/" (in "-Connor"). However, this is not enough to make them non-rhyming according to common rhyming conventions that consider only the last stressed syllable of each word. Therefore, I
kania, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:The word "kania" ends with the sound /nia/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: "n" (consonantal) and "i+a" (vocalic). The word "breighner", on the other hand, also has its own ending sound "/r+n+er/".Since both endings consist of unique combinations of vowels and consonants ("ni-a" vs. "re-n-r"), they can indeed be considered rhym
capella, luella, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "capella" and "luella" do rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the suffix "-lla", which indicates that they share similar ending sounds.* The vowels in both words ("a" and "e") are not exactly identical (they differ only slightly), but this is acceptable as long as the preceding consonants and following consonants/vowels are distinct for rhyming purposes.* In phonetics terms, we can break down each word:
clarence, forbearance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "clarence" ends with the sound /ns/, which is different from the ending of the word "forbearance", which has the diphthong "/ər/" (a combination of two vowels, often transcribed as "er"). However, both endings share the same final vowel sound (/ɑː/) in American English pronunciation or similar close approximations to this phonetic value for other varieties of spoken English.In terms of rhyming criteria you specified
reputation, constipation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "reputation" ends with the sound /ʃən/, which consists of the same vowels (/u/) and consonant(s) (/t, n). The word "constipation" also ends with the sound /teɪʃn/, where "/eɪ/" is pronounced as a single diphthong (a combination of two vowel sounds), but still has the same final consonant(/n).Since they share similar ending patterns in terms of both vowel
prances, glances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "prances" ends with the sound /sɪnz/, which has the same vowels (/i/) as well as similar consonantal endings (both ending in "/z"). The word "glances", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /sns/. Although they differ slightly due to their slight differences in pronunciation ("-iz"- vs "-ns"), both share the common feature of having a long vowel sound preceded by a single consonant letter ('n' or
sidey, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "side" ends with the sound /iːd/.2. The suffix "-ey" in "sidey" adds to this, resulting in the same ending sound.3. In contrast, the word "nix" has a distinct set of vowels/consonants (/ɪks/) that do not match those found at the end of "side".4. Since there's no matching vowel-consonant combination between "
romances, refinances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "romances" ends with the sound /sɪz/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the voiceless alveolar fricative /s/ (different consonant) and the voiced postalveolar approximant /z/. The same sequence is present in the ending "-an-" (/ən/) that follows, as well as the final silent letter /z/.On the other hand, the word "refinances" also has this exact pattern
non-compliance, pseudoscience, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "non-compliance" ends with the sound /ance/, which has the same vowels ("a") but different consonants (/n/) compared to the word "pseudoscience", which also ends with the sound "/ence". Since they share the same ending vowels, but not the preceding consonants, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the definition of rhyming as having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in their final
breighner, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The two sets of words "breighner" and "elcotel" do not meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires that they share similar ending phonemes (consonantal sound(s) + vowel). The letters in their endings differ significantly:* "Breignher" ends with "-er", where both consonants ("r") and vowels () match.* On the other hand, "Elcotl" does not form a valid word
kisling, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "kis" in "Kisling" ends with the sound /s/.2. The next phoneme (sound) after "/s/" is the vowels "i".3. Then, there's another sequence of letters "-ing", which also end with the same consonantal ending "/ng/", following the same vowel sound "/ɪ/".4. Similarly for "RosenE":    - "Ros-" has the final conson
excelling, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "excelling" ends with the sound /ling/, which has the same vowels ("i") as well as similar consecutive consonantal phonemes (/l/) compared to the ending of the phrase "chlorofluorocarbon"s, specifically "/-ons". This similarity in both vocalic and consonantic patterns satisfies the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "excelling" and "chlorofluorocarb-ons" do share
confederation, repudiation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "confederation" ends with the sound /-ation/, which has the vowels "-a-" and the consonant "/n/".* "repudiation" also ends with the sound /-ation/, which again has the same vowels ("-a-") and consonant ("none").Since both words share the same ending pattern, including the identical vowel-consonant combination (-at-ion), they do indeed rhyme according to linguistic rules of rhyming
erlach, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "erlach" and "jammer" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with different consonants ("ch" in "erlach", double-"m" in "jammer") but share similar vowels (-a- sound). This makes them phonetically equivalent at their terminal syllables, fulfilling the definition of rhymes.<|eot_id|>
sowed, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonant, while its corresponding rhyming partner "breon" also has this same ending sound /n/. Although they differ in their preceding consonantal parts (/sw- vs./br-/), both share the common trailing phoneme (the diphthong /oʊ/) that distinguishes them as having similar final syllable patterns. This meets the criteria for perfect rhymes
beary, keary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "beary" and "keary" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /eri/. This is because the final two letters in each word ("ry") form a digraph that represents a single phoneme (/rɪ/) which has the same vowel and consonant combination (identical vowel/consonant). Therefore, according to linguistic rules of perfect rhymes, we can conclude that "beary
schley, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schley" ends with the sound /liː/, which is made up of two phonemes, namely the vowels "/i/" (identical) and the consonant "/l/. On the other hand, the word "zeoli" also has a similar ending pattern, where we find again the same sequence of letters forming the diphthongal combination "/oʊɪ/" or simply "/oi/", consisting of one vowel ("o")
sowed, schaal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonant, while its final syllable "-ed" has a long "o" (ō) as the vowel part of the diphthong (/oʊ/) that's pronounced before the voiced dental stop /d/. On the other hand, "Schaal" in Dutch typically pronounces like "/shɑːl/" or "/xɑːl
keener, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if "keener" and "barrineau" rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables.* The last three letters of the word "keener" are "-ner", which end with distinct consonantal sound /r/.* In contrast, the suffix "-eau" in "Barrineau" is pronounced as a diphthong (a combination of two vowels) /oʊə/, not a single vowel-con
tranter, santor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tranter" ends with the sound /rɛn(tə)r/, which has the same vowels (/e/) and ending consonants (the combination of /t/ and/or /r/) as the word "santor", which also ends with the sound /ˈsæntɔr/. The difference lies in their initial consonants, where "tranter" starts with /tr/ while "santor" begins with /s
iacona, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "iacona" ends with the sound "-ona".2. The word "boerner" also ends with the same sound, which is "-ner".Since they both end with the same combination of vowels (-o-) and consonants (n-er), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the rules you specified: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
fiancee, clancey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fiancee" ends with the sound /ee/, which is pronounced as a diphthong (a combination of two vowel sounds). In this case, the final letters "-nce-" in both "fiancée" and "Clancy" do not follow each other exactly because they belong to separate syllables ("-cé"-in French vs.-cy-in English).However, considering only the last vowels (/iː/) and following consonants
litwiller, siller, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "lit-wiler" (-ler) matches with "-sill-er", which meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, /t/ vs. no distinct consonant in -sil-) followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/iːr/, same as both). This satisfies the definition of perfect rhyme or exact rhyme.<|eot_id|>
stimulation, reorganization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "stimulation" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same vowel (i) and following consonant (n).* The word "reorganization" also ends with the sound /ation/, which again has the same vowel (a) and following consonant (t).Since both words end with similar patterns of vowels and consonants, they can be considered to rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rhyming in English language.
sawdey, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "saw" ends with the sound /dʒiː/, which consists of two parts: the diphthong "/aɪ/" (identical vowels) followed by the consonantal sound "/z/".* "health" also has this same combination, ending in the sound /θ/ or /t͡f/, depending on pronunciation, but for our purpose, we can simplify to just having the final part being a
shelley, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shelley" ends with the sound /iːli/, which consists of two syllables: "/shi/" (identical vowels) + "/le/i/" (different consonants). The word "lockers", on the other hand, also has three parts: "/lɒk/" (same initial consonant), "/ər/" (vowel change), and "/s/" (final consonant).Since both words end with distinct vowel-consonant
canny, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "canny" and "electoral" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "canny" ends with the sound /ni/, which has the distinct consonant combination of "nn", whereas the suffix "-ral" in "electoral" is pronounced as /rəl/. Since they don't share similar ending patterns (different vowels and consonants), they cannot be considered rhyming words according to linguistic standards.<|eot_id|>
enex, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "enex" and "jimi" do not exactly match in their final syllables, but they share the same ending sound /i/. In phonetics, this is considered as having similar or identical vowel and consonant sounds at the end of both words, which makes them rhyming according to linguistic standards for perfect rhymes. However, please note that there might be some debate about whether "en-ex" should technically count as one unit (a d
mary, frary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mary" ends with the sound /ry/, which consists of the vowels "/a/" (the single letter 'a') and the consonant "/r/. Similarly, the word "frary" also ends with the same combination of sounds "/ry/", where again we see the vowel "/a/" paired with the consonant "/r/'. Since they share the same ending pattern (/a+r+y), according to phonological rules for rhyming in English, one
preoccupation, station, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "preoccupation" ends with the sound /ˌprɛ.oʊ.ku̇'eɪ.ʃən/", which consists of three phonemes:1. A diphthong (different vowels) in "/oʊ/"2. Consonant cluster "/k/" + voiced alveolar fricative "/s/3. Vowel-consonant combination "/eɪ/The word "station",
rumination, depopulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "rumination" ends with the sound /ation/, which consists of two consonants (n) followed by the vowels (i, o), then another set of consonants (t).2. "depopulation" also ends with the sound /ation/, which has three consonants (p, l) preceding the same sequence of vowels (e, o), again ending in more consonants (tion).Since both words end with similar patterns -
biery, leary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "biery" ends with the sound /ri/* "leary" also ends with the same sound /ri/Since they both end with the same sequence of vowels (/i/) and consonants (the final /r/i), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme, meeting the criteria for rhyming words in English poetry: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
witching, snitching, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "witching" ends with the sound /tʃɪŋ/, which has the same vowels ("i") and similar consonants (the voiceless postalveolar fricative /tʃ/) as the word "snitching", which also ends with the sound /sɪtʃɪŋ/. The final part of both words (-ching) meets the criteria for rhyming, where there's similarity in
predestination, calculation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "pre" in both words has the same sound (/prɪ/)* The following vowels ("e", "a") also share similar sounds* Finally, the ending consonant clusters ("-stion", "-lution") differ between the two words, which meets the criteria for rhyming (different consonants).Therefore, I conclude that "predestination" and "calculation" do indeed rhyme according to their phonetic similarity.<|eot_id|>
armadillo, delillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "armadillo" and "delillo" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The final syllables of both words ("lo") share the same vowel sound (/o/) and similar consonantal endings (-l-). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceding identical vowels and consonant sounds in their ending parts. Therefore, I conclude that they do rhyme.<|eot_id|>
olokuei's, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "olokuei" ends with the sound /ei/.* The second word "gotten" also ends with the diphthongal sound /ɛn/.Although they may not appear to share similar vowels at a glance, both /ei/ and /ɛn/ can be considered equivalent in terms of rhyming criteria because they contain the same quality (front unrounded) for their respective final vowels (/e
keeney, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "keeney" and "jammu" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. Both words end with the "-ee" suffix, which indicates that they share similar vowel-consonant combinations (identical vowels and distinct consonants). The final letters in both words ("y" in "keeney" and silent "u" or no letter at all after double-"m" in "Jammu") do not affect this
sidey, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "side" ends with the sound /iːd/	+ The final two letters 'ie' make up one phoneme, which represents the long close front unrounded vowel /ɪ:/.	+ Followed by the voiceless alveolar stop /d/.* "smullen" (assuming this means to mean the word that would result from combining "sull-" prefix meaning slow or dull + "-en" suffix forming past
darjeeling, wheeling, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "darjeeling" ends with the sound "-ling", which has the same vowel ("i") and consonant ("ng").* The word "wheeling" also ends with the sound "-ling", which again has the same vowel ("i") and consonant ("ng").Since both words end with the same sequence of vowels and consonants, they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified (different consonants followed by identical vowel and
sighed, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, whereas the name "Reasner" (assuming that's how you intended to write it) doesn't end in exactly matching vowels or consonants, as there is no exact match for the final letters (/r/) of "sighed". Therefore, they do not technically rhyme according to linguistic criteria.<|eot_id|>
teary, dreary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "teary" and "dreary" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is /erī/. This meets one of the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry or songwriting - that two words should end with similar but not necessarily exactly alike phonemes (distinctive units) to create harmony and musicality through repetition. In this case, both vowels ("e") are pronounced similarly as well as their following consonantal sounds (/r/) when
france's, enhances, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "France" ends with the sound /ɛns/, which is pronounced as "ens". On the other hand, the word "enhance"s ends with the sound /ənseɪnz/. Although they do not share exactly same ending letters ("ce", vs. "nce"), their phonetic values match:- Both end in a nasalized vowel sound (the "e" in France being almost silent)- They both follow this vocalic part
extermination, electrification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justifying my response:1. "extermination" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of:	* Consonants: t-n	* Vowel: io (identical)2. "electrification" also ends with the same sound pattern, specifically:	* Consonants: f-c-tion (different from those in "extermination", but still ending with -t-ion)	* Vowels: e-io (identical)Since
olivarez, minjarez, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "oliverez" ends with the sound /ez/.* The second word "minjareZ" also ends with the same sound /ez/, which indicates that they share similar phonetic properties.* Since both words end with the combination of vowels (e, z) in sequence, we can conclude that their final syllables exhibit rhyming characteristics according to linguistic standards for perfect rhymes.However, please note that this analysis
sowed, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sow" and "arion" do not perfectly match in terms of their ending sound, as the correct rhyming pair would require identical vowels and consonant combinations at the end (e.g., sow-low). However, if we consider that the suffix "-ed" is often silent or assimilated into surrounding phonemes, then one could argue that they share similar endings ("-w-" vs.-"-n"). Additionally, some dialectal variations might pronounce
highman, gitano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "high" ends with the sound /n/* "gitano" also ends with the sound /no/Although they differ in their starting letters, both end with similar sounding vowels (/i/) and consonants (/n/, /o/). This meets one of the criteria for rhyming: having identical or very close matching final phonemes (sounds) in two words. Therefore, I conclude that "highman" and "Gitano"
kenn, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenn" ends with the sound /n/, which is not present in the last syllable of "chlorofluorocarbons". However, both end with a silent E or a similar phonetic pattern (the double F's in chloro- don't affect the rhyming process). Therefore, considering only the final vowels (/ɛ/) as well as their following consonantal sounds (/n/), we can conclude that they do indeed share
malignant, indignant, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "malignant" ends with the sound /nt/, which consists of the vowels "/a/" (alveolar) and the consonantal nasal stop "/n/", while the word "indignant" also ends with the same combination, namely "/t"/ (dental), "/i"/ (front unrounded close-mid), and again "/n"/>.Since both ending sequences share similar phonetic properties - distinct consonants ("nd") accompanied by matching vowel qualities
pary, chary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "ry" in both "pary" and "chary" has similar sound patterns, with the same vowels ("y") being pronounced similarly (as /ɛr/) following distinct but matching consonantal clusters (/pr/ and /chr/, respectively). This meets the criteria for rhyming words to share different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The similarity of their final syllables (-ry) allows them to be considered as having
side, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The justification is that the word "side" has the ending sound /dʒ/, whereas the suffix "-baran" appears to end with the sound sequence "/rɑn". The difference in their final phonemes (distinctive units of speech) disqualifies them from being rhyming.In linguistics, perfect rhymes require matching patterns between vowels and following consonantal sequences. In this case, the distinctiveness of the voiced postalveolar fricative (/
saudi, petrilla, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "saudi" ends with the sound /iː/* "petrilla" also ends with the same sound /ɪlə/Both words end with similar phonetic patterns, which include:	+ Different initial consonants (/s/, /p/)	+ Identical vowels (both ending in "/ɪ/")	+ Similar final consonantal sounds (/uːdʃ/, /lə/) that follow the preceding
camillo, carrasquillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "camillo" and "carrasquillo" rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables. The last four letters of each word ("illo", "-squillo") share similar characteristics:* They both end with double consonants (ll-).* Their vowels (-i) match.* Although they differ in preceding consonants ('m' vs 'r'), this does not affect rhyming since only the final phonemes matter
mary, stary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mary" ends with the sound /ry/, which is pronounced as a distinct combination of vowels (the 'a' in this case) and consonants (/r/) together, specifically the diphthong /er/. Similarly, the word "starry" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes, namely /rry/.Since both words share similar final syllable sequences (-ery), they meet the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic rules governing
interpretation, affirmation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "interpretation" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same vowel ("i") and following consonant (/n/) as in the word "affirmation". This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two words share similar ending phonemes (consonantal or vocalic). Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
nyx, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nyx" ends with the sound /ks/, which is a combination of a consonant (k) and a sibilant (/s/) that's pronounced together as one unit, whereas in phonetics this is represented as /ŋz/. On the other hand, the suffix "-boern-" has the ending "/rn/", where both letters ("r" and "n") produce distinct vocalic sounds when combined.Although they don't share exact matching
hermann, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "Hermann" and "Enix" can be analyzed as follows:* Hermann ends with the sound /nɪks/	+ Different consonant is "/k/"	+ Identical vowels are none	+ Consonant sound after last vowel (none) matches, but there's no second vowel to compare.* Enix ends with the sound /niks/Since both end with the same sequence of phonemes (/nɪ
reverential, jurisprudential, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if the words "reverential" and "jurisprudential" rhyme, we need to analyze their final syllables.* The word "reverential" ends with "-ional", which has the sound /iːnəl/.* The word "jurisprudential" also ends with "-ional", but its pronunciation is slightly different: /jʊrɪspraʳdɛntial/.
sawdey, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sawday" and "Reisenauer" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "sawday" has distinct consonantal sounds (/sw/, /d/) whereas in the name "Reisenauer", there is no similar sound combination after the vowels ("ei"). Additionally, even if we consider only the final syllables (-ay vs -er), they don't share any common phonetic features to qualify as rhyming. Therefore, based on this analysis
indoctrination, simulation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "indoctrination" ends with the sound /ation, which has the same vowel (i) and following consonant (/t/) as the suffix "-ulation", found in the word "simulation". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but sharing similar ending vowels and final consonants.<|eot_id|>
geary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: In the pair of words "geary" and "beary", we can see that they share similar ending patterns, with both having "-ery" suffixes. The vowels in each word ("e" and "a") also match exactly, which is one criterion for rhyming. Additionally, while not all their consonantal parts (the letters preceding the shared suffix) are identical, there's still some similarity between them, specifically in terms of sound and position within the
convalescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "convalescence" and "fluorescence" do indeed share the same ending sound /ənsēs/. This is because they both end with the suffix "-ence", which contains the identical vowels "/ɛ/" (the letter "e") and the shared consonantal sequence "/n"s/, making them rhyming pairs according to phonological criteria for perfect rhymes in English, specifically involving differences only at non-vocalic positions of syllables
keanu, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the ending sound of "keanu" (-nu) matches with the ending sound "-reisena-" in Reisenauer, which also ends with -na-. The vowels 'e' and 'a' appear consecutively but not exactly at the same position; however, they both represent similar vocalic patterns (monophthongs), making them phonetically equivalent for rhyming purposes. Additionally, there's no significant difference between their following consonantal sounds
resenting, venting, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "resenting" ends with the sound "-enting", which is composed of two distinct consonants ("n" and "t") following one vowel sound ("-en"). Similarly, the word "venting" also ends with the same sequence of sounds (-"-ent-ing"), where both vowels share similar phonetic properties (identical). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming words having differing consonants preceded by matching vowel-consonant combinations. Therefore, I conclude that indeed
saudi, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /ti/, which is made up of two distinct parts - the vowel sound "/a/" (the letter "i") and the consonantal sound "/t/. Similarly, the suffix "-gettin'" also has the same ending pattern where there's a single-vowel-consonant combination (-"/in/", in this case). Since both endings share similar patterns ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds"),
sader, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**I justified this response as follows:1. The two sets of letters "sader" and "-acona" do not share the same ending sound.2. In order for rhyming to occur, the final syllables (or phonemes) should match exactly in terms of their vocalic quality ("i") and any subsequent consonantal elements.In conclusion, since there is no matching sequence of vowels and consonants at the end of both words, they cannot be considered rh
patrol, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "patrol" and "zeal" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words end with distinct consonantal sounds: /l/ in "patrol" and /l/ or /əl/ (the schwa sound) in "zeal".* However, they share similar vowel sounds (/æ/) preceding those consonants.* According to phonological rules, this similarity is sufficient for two words to be considered rhyming,
sidi, schueler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidi" ends with the sound /iː/, which is pronounced like long 'e', whereas the word "schuler" (German for "school") ends with the diphthong /uər/. Although they don't share exact same vowels, we can consider them as having similar vowel sounds (/ɪ/) in terms of phonetics. In English linguistics, this type of rhyming scheme where two words end with distinct but
excelling, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "excelling" and "smullen" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound "-ling". This is because of their shared suffixes (-ll- + -ng), which indicate that they follow similar patterns in terms of vowels (both ending with /ɪŋ/) and consonants (/l/, /n/, respectively).<|eot_id|>
noxso, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "nox" has the ending sound /ksəʊ/* The word "coiner" ends with the sound /nɪr/Although they don't share exact spelling, their phonetic pronunciations match: both end with a similar sequence of vowels (identical) and consonants (/k/, /s/, or /ŋ/) which makes them rhyming words according to the definition provided in your question.<|eot_id|>
kenna, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenna" ends with the sound /na/, which is composed of two parts - the vowel sound "/a/" (the single quote indicates that it's not stressed) and the nasal consonant sound "/n/. Similarly, the word "boerner" also ends with the same combination "-er", where again we see the unstressed vowel sound "/e/" paired with the voiced alveolar fricative consonant sound "/r/.The presence or absence
goyim, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "goyim" (pronounced as /ˈgoʊɪm/) and "Koehn" (/kɛhn/) both end with similar sounds:* "-im" in "goyim" has the same ending sound ("-ih-m") which consists of:	+ Identical vowels: "/i/"	+ Consonant(s): "/h", then nasalized m* "-hen
fery, kary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "fery" and "kary" do indeed share similar characteristics, which define rhyming:1. The final syllables of both words ("ry") contain distinct consonantal phonemes /r/.2. Both words end with vowels (the diphthong combination in "fery", and a single vowel sound in "kary").3. These consecutive vowel-consonant combinations (/er/, /ar/) match exactly between the two words
mistrials, vials, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three letters "rials" in both "mistrials" and "vials" share similar characteristics, which makes them rhyming:* The same vowels ("i") appear at the end of each word.* The final consonantal sound "/r/" (alveolar trill) is also present in both cases.This meets the criteria for two words to rhyme: having distinct but matching ending patterns with regards to their vocalic and consonantal
laurence, abhorrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "Laurence" ends with the sound /əns/, which has the same vowel (/ɛ/) as well as similar but not exactly matching consonantal sounds (the letter combination "ncs"). On the other hand, the word "abhorrence" also ends with the sound /əns/. Although they don't share exact matches in their ending letters or diacritical marks, both words follow this rhyming pattern of having differing consonants preceded by
arseneau, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "arseneau" ends with the sound /eu/.* The word "germer" also ends with the same sound /er/. However, when considering only the final consonant phoneme (m vs eu), they differ.	+ In "ar sene au", the last two letters ("ue") form a single unit that represents a distinct phonetic entity (/œu/) whereas in "gem er", there's no such combination;
patients, orientations, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "patients" ends with the sound /nts/, which is composed of two distinct consonants (/n/ and /t/) followed by the same vowel sound (the schwa, or neutral vowel). Similarly, the word "orientations" also has this pattern, ending in the sequence /sʰɪz/. Both sequences meet the criteria for rhyming as they share similar patterns of consonant-vowel-consonant sounds at their terminal points.
shelor, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the two sets of letters "sheler" and "Arseneault" do not share similar ending sounds, which is one way to define rhyming.In order for them to rhyme:1. The final vowels should match: In this case, they don't (e.g., -er in "sheler" vs. no distinct vowel sound at all in "Arseneault").2. Consonantal endings also need to align: There's no
francesmary, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The words "franc", "Mary" and "mccar-y" all end with the same sound /y/. The vowels in each word ("a" and "i") do not affect the rhyming quality, as they are pronounced differently (e.g., the first "a" is silent). Additionally, the final consonants "-c"s also match between the three words. According to phonological rules of English language, this combination meets the criteria for perfect
torrence, abhorrence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "torrance" (-ance) has different consonants (n, c) but similar vowels ("a") compared to the ending sound of "abhorrence" (-ence). The same pattern applies in both cases: different initial consonants (t vs. ab), yet matching final vowel-consonant combinations ("-ance" vs. "-ence"). This meets the criteria for rhyming words according to linguistic rules governing phonetic similarity between word endings
mccary, mcnary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "mccary" and "mcnary" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming:1. They both end with distinct consonantal phonemes: /ry/2. The preceding vowels in each word ("c" and "n") sound similar, making them homophones (/ˈkɛrɪi/ vs./ˈmənɛri/) when pronounced.3. When combined, this similarity creates
mcleary, beary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "mclearly" ends with the sound /liː/, which consists of two phonemes: /l/ (the consonant) + /iː/ (the long-vowel). The word "beary", on the other hand, also has a similar ending pattern - /rɪ/ consisting of one consonant (/r/) plus another pair of vowels (/i/).In terms of rhyming criteria, we look for differences in initial conson
sidey, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "side" has the same ending sound as the suffix "-ey", which meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, no additional consonants) followed by identical vowels ("i") and consonent sounds ("-d"). The addition of the prefix "prom-" does not affect the final syllable's pronunciation or its potential to rhyme with other words. Therefore, I conclude that "sidey" and "prom" do indeed
miscalculation, graduation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "miscalculation" and "graduation" do not rhyme.Justification:The two-syllable word "miscalculation" ends with the sound /ˌsælkʊlətɪn/, which has distinct consonantal and vocalic components (/k/ + /l/ + /u/). The three-syllable word "graduation", on the other hand, concludes in the sequence /ˈdjuː
haggart, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "haggart" and "gotten" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("t" in "haggart" and "ten" in "gotten") share similar phonetic characteristics:	+ They start with distinct consonantal sounds (/t/, /n/) that differ from one another.	+ Both end with vowels (the diphthong "/ɑː/" or monophthongs like "/ə
schley, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "schley" and "Koehne" rhyme, we need to examine their phonetic structure. Both words end with "-ey" or "-öh-" which is considered as having identical vowel sound ("e"). Additionally, both words also share similar final consonantal sounds /y/. Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of rhyming defined earlier (different consonants followed by identical vowels
dairy, kairey, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dairy" and "kairiey" do rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /ey/, which is considered as having identical vowel and consonant sounds.* The only difference between them is that one has the prefix "di-" in front of "-ary", while the other starts with "Kair-", but this doesn't affect their final rhyming sound.So, based on the definition of perfect rhymes (different initial consonants
calvillo, biondolillo, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "calvillo" ends with the sound /o/.2. The second word "biondolillo" also ends with the same sound "/o/".3. Both words share this ending, which means they meet the criteria for rhyming: having similar or identical vowel-consonant combinations at their end.Therefore, based on phonetic analysis of both words' endings, I conclude that indeed "calvillo"
schul, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schul" and "hymen" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /n/. Although their initial letters differ ("s-" in "schul" vs. no letter at all in "hymen"), this does not affect the final phonetic similarity between them. In linguistics terms, we can say that the vowels (/u/) and following nasal consonant (/n/) are identical in
petrelli, homeowner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if the two words "petrelli" and "homeowner" rhyme, we need to analyze their final syllables.* The last three letters of "petrelli" are "elli", which end with the sound /ɪli/.* The last four letters of "homeowner" are "ower", which end with the sound /ouər/.Since they don't share similar vowel-consonant combinations in their ending sounds (/ɪ
sader, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sader" ends with the sound /dər/, which has the same vowel (/e/) and consonant (/r/) as the word "smullen", which also ends in /lən/. Since they share similar ending phonemes, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified (different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
silsby, schley, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "Silsby" ends with the sound /bi/, which has the same vowel ("i") and final consonant (/b/) sounds.* "Schley" also ends with the sound /li/, which again has the same vowel ("i") and final consonant(/l) sounds, although not exactly matching "/b/" in "Silsby", they still share similar characteristics of having distinct vowels (both "i"s), making them rh
reputation, computerization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Here's the justification:1. "reputation" ends with "-ution", which has two distinct consonants ("t") following a single vowel sound.2. "computerization" also ends with "-tion", which again consists of two distinct consonants ("n") after a single vowel.Since both ending patterns meet the criteria for rhyming, where they share similar but not exactly matching final syllable sounds (different consonants + same vowels), I conclude that yes, indeed
hammann, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hammann" ends with the sound /nɑːmən/, which has the same vowel ("a") as well as similar (but not exactly matching) consonant sounds (/mn/) compared to the ending of the second word, "boerner", which also contains the vowel "/er/" and the consonant combination "/nr/. Although they do not match perfectly, this similarity in both vowels and consonants can still indicate rhyming
petrilla, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "pet" has the sound /et/, which is a diphthong (a combination of two vowels) that ends with a distinct consonantal sound (/t/). Similarly, in the word "incase", we can identify the sequence "/in/" as having a separate phonetic value from other parts of the syllable ("case"). Since both sequences end with unique combinations of vowel-consonant pairs (/et/) and (/n+s/), respectively,
soady, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "soad"y and "eas-el" both end with the same sound, which is /el/. This satisfies one of the criteria for rhyming, that being having similar or identical ending phonemes (sounds). Additionally, they also share the same vowels ("a") before their final consonantal segments (/d/, /l/) respectively, another characteristic of perfect rhymes in English language poetry. Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed, "so
calvano, pantano, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "calvano" ends with the sound /-ono/, which consists of two consonants (n) followed by one vowel ("o") and another consonant ("no"). Similarly, the word "pantano" also ends with the same sequence: -on-. The vowels in both cases are identical ("o"), but their following consonants differ (-n vs.-t). Therefore, according to phonological rules for rhyming, they do indeed
phosphorescence, fluorescence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "phosphorescence" and "fluorescence" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The two words share similar endings (-ence), which would suggest they might rhyme at first glance. However, upon closer inspection of their phonetic composition, we can see that while both end with /əns/, the preceding consonantal sound is what sets them apart from truly rhyming.In "phosphorescence", there's a distinct voiceless labiodental fric
o'connor, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o'Connor" ends with the sound /rʌnə(r)/, which has distinct vowels (/u/) and consecutive consonants (/"rn"/). Similarly, the word "Bruney" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes /iː(n)ɛ/. Since they share the same ending pattern (-ern), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified.<|eot_id|>
shaul, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shaul" ends with the sound /l/, which is not present in the word "brun". However, both words end with the same vowel sound (/u/) and no other consonantal suffixes follow this vowel sound. Therefore, according to the definition of rhyming as having differing consonants preceded by identical vowels and following consonants (or none), we can conclude that indeed "shaul" and "brun" do share similar ending patterns
reflection, overprotection, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "reflection" and "overprotection" do not rhyme.Justification: The final syllables of both words differ in their consonantal endings:* Reflection ends with "-ction", which contains distinct consonants (t-c-n).* Overprotection ends with "-tion", but this time around has no new consonants added to its suffix (-n is repeated).The presence or absence of unique consonants following similar vowels ("ion") distinguishes them as non-rhym
zedillo's, amarillos, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zedillo" and "amarillos" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "zedillo" ends with the sound /oʊlɪloʊ/, which has distinct consonantal sounds (/d/ and /ll/) preceding the vowels.* In contrast, the word "amarillos" also ends with the same diphthongal sound /iˈloʊs/.	+ However, in this case, we can see
stimulation, notification, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "stimulation" and "notification" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same vowel sound ("ation") which is accompanied by distinct but similar consonant clusters (tion). This meets the definition of perfect rhyme in linguistics.<|eot_id|>
resented, lamented, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "resented" and "lamented" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The final syllables of both words end with "-ent-ed", which share similar vowels ("e") and ending consonants ("-nt").2. In phonetics, this pattern is known as perfect rhyming or exact matching.3. According to linguistic rules, when two words meet specific criteria such as having same terminal vowels (in this case, "/ɛ/") and following consonants
seader, schul, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:The words "seader" and "schul" do not exactly match the criteria for rhyming, which is having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.In this case, both words end with "-er" or "-l", but they don't share the same exact sound pattern in their vowels (e.g., "ea-" vs. "u-"). The difference lies mainly in the initial letters ("s"/"sc") rather than
bossman, mossman, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the suffix "-os" in both "bossman" and "mossman" has the same sound, which means they share identical vowel and consonant sounds (the /s/) at their end. Additionally, all other letters preceding this shared suffix remain unchanged ("b", "o", "m" vs. "m"). This meets the criteria for rhyming words with different initial consonants but sharing similar ending patterns.<|eot_id|>
scholer, gahm, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "scholar" ends with the sound /ər/.* The word "gahn" (assuming you meant to write "Gham", which I'll assume since there's no such common English word like "gaum") also ends with the same diphthongal sound /ɑːn/.Since they both end with the same combination of vowels (/a/) and consonants (/h/, in this case), we can
duty, fruity, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "duty" ends with the sound /ti/, which is made up of the same vowels (u) and consonants (/t/) as in the second syllable "-ty". The word "fruity", on the other hand, also has two syllables: "fruit-" ending with the sound /iː/ (long 'e' or 'ee'), and "-y" having its own distinct pronunciation (/jɪ). Although both words end with -
aspiration, meditation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "aspiration" ends with the sound /tion/, which has the same vowels (/i/) and consonants (the 'n' at the end) as the word "meditation", which also ends in "/tion/. The presence of identical vowel-consonant combinations indicates rhyming between the two words, despite having some differences in their overall pronunciation due to other preceding or following phonemes."<|eot_id|>
canary, mccary, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "canary" ends with the sound /ry/, which is made up of the letters R-Y, where Y represents a consonantalized semivowel (also known as a liquid). On the other hand, the word "mccary" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes (/rY/).Since both words share the same ending pattern (-RY), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming in English poetry and linguistics. In this
essential, differential, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "essential" and "differential" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "essential" ends with the sound /l/, which is pronounced as a distinct consonantal sound (the voiced alveolar lateral approximant). On the other hand, the word "differential" ends with the diphthongal combination of /ərɪʃ(ə)l/. The key difference lies in their final vowels: while both end with a similar but
borneo, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "borneo" and "priam" do not rhyme.Justification: To determine if two words rhyme, we need to check their ending sounds. In this case:* The word "bornéo" ends with "-eo", which has distinct vowels (e) and no shared consonants.* The word "Priam" ends with "-iam", which also lacks common consonants or identical vowel-consonant combinations.Since they don't share similar endings in terms of
haman, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The provided words "haman" and "noxso" do not follow the typical pattern of rhyming, where two or more words share similar ending sounds (consonant-vowel-consonant). In this case:* "man" in "haman" has a distinct sound (/m/) whereas* There is no corresponding /n/x combination at the end of "noxso".Additionally, even if we ignore the mismatched initial letters ("h
shelly, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelly" and "Gaetano" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "shelly" ends with the sound /ly/, which is made up of the letters L-Y, whereas the name "Gaetano" does not end with this exact same combination of vowels and consonants (i.e., no identical vowel-consonant pair). Therefore, they cannot be considered rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes in English language poetry or
patina, messina, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "patina" ends with the sound /na/.2. The word "messina" also ends with the same sound /na/.As they both share the same ending sound, which includes the vowel "a" accompanied by the consonantal sound "/n", we can conclude that indeed, "patina" and "Messina" do rhymed in terms of having similar final syllables.<|eot_id|>
predation, reiteration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "predation" ends with the sound /shn/, while the word "reiteration" ends with the sound /teyn/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal sounds, both end with vowels ("i") that precede similar final consonental sounds (/n"/ and "/tn"). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, as per linguistics rules of phonetics.<|eot_id|>
schul, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schul-" ends with the sound /l/, which is then followed by the same vowel sound as in "Hermann", namely /ɛr/. The combination of consonants "-h" at the beginning, along with the matching vowel-consonant pair (/ər/) makes them rhyming words. However, please note that this might not exactly match common English pronunciation or vocabulary due to cultural differences (Schule/Schülerei being German terms).
disqualification, reiteration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "disqualification" and "reiteration" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (-ation). Although their meanings differ significantly, their ending syllables share the same phonetic pattern (identical vowels and final consonants), making them technically rhyme-worthy.<|eot_id|>
sowed, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/, which is not identical to any of the letters in "summerlin". The correct rhyming assessment requires comparing the final vowels (in this case, none) and consonants (/ed/) between two words.In contrast, if we compare only the last parts of each word ("wed", "merlin"), they don't share similar ending patterns either: "/wɛd/" vs. "/r
schul, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "schu" in "schula"s has the same sound as "al-" in "Alcoa".	+ Both start with distinct consonantal sounds /ʃ/ (sh) and /l/.	+ The following vowels "/u/" and "" both represent long close-mid back rounded vowel phonemes.	+ Finally, they end with similar consonatal sounds /əs/ and "", which also match each other.This meets all
sidi, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sidi" and "annex" do not exactly rhyme.Justification: Although they both end with "-ix", which might suggest that they could potentially rhyme, the initial consonantal sound is different ("sid-" vs. "an-", respectively). In linguistics terms, this means their rhyming scheme would require matching phonemes in syllables beyond just ending vowels (which also need to match).In general, perfect rhymes typically involve similar or exact matches of conson
bleary, thiery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bleary" and "thiery" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The ending sound of both words is "-ry", which indicates that they share similar phonetic characteristics.2. Both words end with distinct consonantal clusters ("lyr") in addition to their shared final vowels (-y).3. Since the last two letters (the diphthong -iy) form part of this rhyming pattern, we can conclude that despite having slightly different
enex, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "enex" ends with the sound /eks/.* The second word "castings" also has two syllables, ending with "-sts".	+ In the suffix "-st", we can identify the same vowels "/s/" (the voiceless alveolar fricative) which makes them rhyming.    - Although they differ in their initial letters ("c-" vs. no letter), this difference does not affect whether
predestination, ideation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of both "predesti-nation" and "idea-tion" end with similar sound patterns:* "-tion" in "predestination"* "-tion" in "ideation"Both suffixes contain the same vowels ("i") and ending consonantal sounds ("-n"). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, as they share distinct characteristics despite being part of different base words.<|eot_id|>
vary, dery, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "vary" and "derry" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /ary/. Although their meanings differ ("to change or modify something" vs. a place name), the phonetic ending is identical (-ry). This characteristic of having different initial consonants but sharing similar terminal vowels and consonants (in this case -y) defines perfect rhymes in English poetry and linguistics. Therefore, I conclude
ablation, synchronization, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "ablation" ends with the sound /tion/, which consists of two distinct consonants (t) followed by one vowel sound (/i/) and another consonant sound (/n/)* "synchronization" also ends with the sound /ation/, which again has two distinct consonants (t) followed by one vowel sound (/a/) and another consonant sound (/n/)As both words end with different consonants, namely t-n in "
synchronization, approbation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "synchronization" ends with the sound "-ion"* The word "approval" (not "approbation", which has a slightly different meaning) also ends with the same sound "-ion"Since they both end in -ion, we can conclude that their last syllables share similar vowel-consonant combinations, making them rhyming words according to the definition provided.<|eot_id|>
education, interpretation, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "education" ends with the sound /shun/, which consists of two distinct parts - "/ed-" (the root) and "-uction" (-on, ending). Similarly, the word "interpretation" also has multiple components: "/in-", "/", "-ter", "-", "-pre-ta-, tion". Despite their differences in meaning and etymology, both words end with vowels ("u" for "education") or diphthongs (/iər/)
unofficial, judicial, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "unofficial" ends with the sound /ful/, which is comprised of two distinct parts - "/f/" (consonant) + "/ul/" (vowel-consonant). Similarly, the word "judicial" also ends with the sound /ial/. Since both endings consist of different consonants (/f/ vs. //) preceded by identical vowels ("u") and ending in similar consonantal sounds ("/l"/), they technically meet the criteria for
shill, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if the words "shill" and "Rosene" rhyme, we need to examine their phonetic composition.* The word "shill" has two distinct parts: /ʃɪl/. Here, "/ˈʃ/" represents the sound of the letter combination "SH", which is voiced postalveolar fricative; "/ɪ/" stands for the short vowel sound like in "hit"; and "/l/" denotes the al
keener, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "keener" ends with the sound /er/.* The name "Arseneault" also ends with the sound /rəl/.Although they may not look like perfect rhymes at first glance, since one is a common English suffix (-ner) while the other is a proper noun (the surname Arseneault), their final phonetic sequences match: both end in /er/. This meets the criteria for having different consonants followed
soady, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "soad"y has the same ending sound /y/* "smul"len also has the same ending sound /n/Although they differ in their initial letters, both end with similar vowels (/o/) and final consonants (both being voiced stops), which makes them rhyming words according to your definition of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
killion, castrillon, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "killion" ends with the sound /n/, which is followed by the same vowel sound "/i/" as in "castrillon", also ending with the sound /n/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar final phonemes (consonantal sequence). In this case, both words end with the combination of vowel-consonant ("-il-" and "-on") making them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
replication, nitration, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "replication" ends with the sound /-tion/.2. Similarly, the word "nitration" also ends with the same sound /-tion/.Since they both end with the same suffix (-ition), which includes different consonants (R/N) but has identical vowels ('i' in both cases), we can conclude that indeed, they do share rhyming characteristics according to your definition of having different consonants followed by identical
billy's, fillies, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "billy" ends with the sound /lies/, which has the same vowels (i) and ending consonent(s)/l/. The word "fillies", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /lis/, which again shares the same vowels (i) and ending consonents(/s). Since both end-words share similar patterns of consecutive identical vowel-consonant combinations (/il/) at their conclusion, they can be considered rhyming
circumspection, resurrection, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "circumspection" ends with the sound /ˌsɛksən/ (sek-suhn), which consists of the vowels "/ɪ/" (i) and "/ʊ/" (u) preceded by the consonantal cluster "/m/" and "/k/", respectively, as well as ending in the nasalized consonant "/t/. On the other hand, the word "resurrection" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes:
schlee, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schlee" and "Hermann" do not perfectly match in terms of rhyming, but they share similar phonetic characteristics that make them close approximations to rhyming. Both contain the long 'ee' sound (the same as the word "see"), which is what makes their ending sounds seem almost identical despite being written differently due to linguistic differences between languages or dialects. In linguistics, this phenomenon can occur when two distinct pronunciations
lockers, postdating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lockers" ends with the sound /rs/, which is made up of two distinct consonantal sounds, while the word "postdating" also has multiple syllables that end in the same way - "/ting/" (made up of three phonemes). Since both words follow this pattern of having different initial consonants but ending with similar vocalic-consonantic combinations (/r-s-/) or (/t-n-g/), they technically do not meet the criteria
