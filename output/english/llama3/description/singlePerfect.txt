sighed, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal sound, while the suffix "-nex" has no corresponding consonant in its ending but shares the same vowel sound "/ɛ/" (as pronounced). This meets the criteria for rhyming as described - having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, although there's not exactly a perfect match due to the absence of matching consonants after
drill, mcgill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "drill" ends with the sound /l/, which is preceded by the vowels /i/. The same applies to the word "mcgill", where "/i/" precedes the letter combination "/ll". Since both pairs of letters (/il/) share the same ending, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, /drl/ vs./mcl/) but following them with identical vowel-consonant
lookers, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "looker" ends with the sound /rɪz/, which consists of two distinct parts - "/r/" (the consonantal part) and "/iz/" (the vocalic-consonantal part). Similarly, the suffix "-enix" also has three phonemes (/n/) as its initial consonantal part, then the vowels ("e") in both cases, finally ending with another consonental cluster ("-x"). Since they share similar patterns regarding their
boisclair, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "boisclairs" ends with the sound /kliːr/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds (/skl/) followed by the same vowel sound (/iː/) and another consonental sound (/r/). Similarly, the word "mare" also has three phonemes (sounds) at its end - /mɛər/. Since both sequences contain dissimilar consonants preceded by matching vowels, they technically do not perfectly
sidey, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidey" has the ending sound /iːdi/, which is made up of two parts - "/ī/" (identical vowels) and "/d/" (consonant). Similarly, the word "ken" also ends with the sound /ɛn/, consisting of one part "/ə/" (vowel) and "/n/" (consonant).Since both pairs share similar structures (/ī+/ vs /ə+), they can technically
contusion, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "contusion" ends with the sound /ʃən/, which consists of the same vowels (/ɪ/) and consonants (the voiceless palatal fricative /ʃ/).* The word "jammer" also ends with the sound /r̩, əm/, where "/r/" represents a voiced alveolar trill or flap, and "/əm/" means that there's a schwa
bowron, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bowron" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowel sound /o/. Then comes another set of consonants "/r/", again ending in the same vowel/consonant combination as before (i.e., `/o` + `"/`). Similarly for "germer", we see that both end with the consonantal suffixes `/-rn>` following each other. This satisfies the criteria to determine if they do indeed
jheel, surreal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "jheel" and "surreal" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "jheel" ends with the sound /l/, whereas the word "surreal" ends with the diphthong /rə/. The vowels in both words differ (short 'e' vs long 'u'), as well as their final consonantal endings (/l/ vs /rə/). Therefore, they don't meet the criteria for rhyming words which
goyim, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "goyim" and "gemmer" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /ɪm/, which is the combination of a short 'i' (vowel) and the letter 'M' (consonant).* The preceding letters in both words ("go-" and "-gen") also follow this pattern: they consist of distinct consonants ('G', not shared between them; and '-n-', again unique to each
alcoa's, gertner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "alcoa" ends with the sound /sɪz/, which is pronounced as "-is". On the other hand, the name "Gernetr" (assuming that's correct) also has its last part ending in "/tər", which can be simplified to -er. Since both endings (-is and -er) share similar vowel-consonant combinations (/iːʳ/) they technically meet the criteria for rhyming
hille, sill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hilles" ends with the sound /ɪl/, which consists of two distinct parts: a single vowel phoneme (/i/) and a consonantal cluster (/lʃ/). Similarly, the word "sill" also ends with the same exact sequence: a single vowel phoneme (/ɪ/) and another instance of the consonantal cluster (/l/).Since both sequences share the same final syllable pattern - namely, a short-v
gama, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gama" and "Geitner" do not rhyme.Justification:The reason is that they don't share the same ending sound pattern despite having similar starting letters. In rhyming words, the final consonantal sequence (if present) should match exactly between two or more words to create perfect phonetic similarity. Here:* The word "GAMA" ends with /a/* While GeitNER ends with /er/Since their last syllable's
real, surreal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "real" and "surreal" meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires:1. Different initial consonants: In this case, both words start with distinct letters - "r" in "real" and "sur-" (a prefix) in "surreal".2. Identical final vowels: Both words end with the same sound /ɛl/, where the letter combination "-el" represents a single phoneme.3
encase, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "encase" ends with the sound /seɪs/, which has the same vowel (/e/) and final consonant (/s/) as the word "Keane", pronounced like "/kiːn/" (with no additional consonant). Since they share similar ending patterns, we can conclude that "encase" and "Kean(e)" do indeed rhyme according to their phonetic characteristics.<|eot_id|>
saad, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "saad" ends with the sound /d/, which has no matching consonant in the suffix "-bowron". However, both end with the same vowels (-a-). The rhyming criteria you specified ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds") match this case: they differ only in their final consonantal sounds (/d/ vs none), but share similar ending vowels (both -a-). Therefore, I conclude that indeed
heman, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "heman" and "Koehne" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. The word "heman" ends with the sequence /man/, which consists of distinct consonantal sounds (/m/) and vowel phonemes (the diphthong "/aɪ/" in this case). On the other hand, the surname "Koehne" concludes with the combination /
coiner, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "coiner" ends with the sound /r/ (the letter R) followed by the vowel sound /ɪn/ (long 'i' in "pin") and then another consonantal sound /ər/ (a silent E).* The word "rosten" also ends with the same consonantal sound /st/. Although this may seem like two distinct consonants, they share the same phonetic value (/s+t/)
necaise, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their final syllables' phonetic characteristics. In the case of "necase" (not actually present in your example) vs. "germer", both end with distinct vowels ("e") and no following consonant sound is shared between them. Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming, as per linguistic standards. Note that I assumed you meant "necase" instead of "necaise
soady, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "soad"y ends with the sound /iː/2. Chloro-fluoro-car-bons, on the other hand, has multiple syllables that end differently:	* chlor-: /ɒr/	* flu-or-o-: /ʊər/, then /aʊ/	* car-b-ons: /kærz/Although there might not seem to match at first glance due to
fair's, repairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fair" ends with the sound /rɪz/, which consists of the same vowels (/i/) and different consonants (the digraph "/rz"/). Similarly, the phrase "repairs" also has the ending sound /reʔpərs/, consisting of the same vowel (/eɪ/) but different consecutive consonants ("rp", not including the silent "s"). Since they share no matching vowel-consonant combinations at their end
acid, shelor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "acid" ends with the sound /id/, which has the same vowels ("i") but different consonants (/c/d/) compared to the word "sheler", which also ends with the sound /er/. The identity of the final vowels is not sufficient for rhyming, as per linguistic rules; instead, we need matching consecutive vowel-consonant pairs (CV) or diphthongs in both ending syllables. Since they do meet this criteria, I conclude
vanheel, surreal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "van" ends with the sound /n/* "heel" also ends with the same sound /l/* Both end in the long 'e' (ee) which has similar vowel/consonant combinationsHowever, they do not exactly match because of their differing initial letters ("v-" vs "-h-").In conclusion, while there's no exact perfect rhyming between those two sets of syllables, I would argue that they share
o'shell, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o' shell" ends with the sound /ɛl/, which is made up of two parts - the vowel sound "/ɛ/" (a short, open-mid front unrounded vowel) and the consonantal sound "/l/", both following each other in sequence. On the other hand, the word "Geithner" also ends with the same combination of phonemes - the diphthongized vowel sound "/aiˈnər
contusion, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "contusion" ends with the sound /ʃən/, which consists of the same consonant ("sh") followed by the vowels "e" and then the nasal consonant "/n/".On the other hand, the word "rasper" (not "Rasner", I assume that's a typo) also has this ending: `/spɛr`, where we can see two distinct consonants ("s" and "p"), but they're both
nyx, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nyx" and "Locatelli" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "nyx" ends with the sound /ks/, which is represented by the letters "xy".* The surname "Locatelli", however, has its final syllable ending in the diphthong "/ɛli/" (a combination of vowels).* Since they don't share similar vowel-consonant patterns at their end, we can conclude that they don't
paired, dared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "paired" and "dared" do rhyme.Justification:* The final syllable of both words ends with the same sound /erd/.* Although they differ in their initial letters (P vs D), this does not affect the rhyming quality.* Rhyme is determined primarily by the ending phonemes (/rd/) rather than the beginning or middle parts of the word.* Therefore, based on the shared /erd/ suffix at the end, we can conclude
shiller, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shiller" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of a schwa (a neutral, unstressed vowel) + r-consonant combination (/ɹ/). On the other hand, the phrase "chlorofluorocarbons" has multiple syllables that end in various ways:* Chloro- ends with -oro-, consisting of o-vowel + double-r-consonants* fluoro- ends with -u-or
unaware, blair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "unaware" ends with the sound /are/, which is made up of the vowels "/a/" and the consonant "/r/", while the name "Blair" also ends with the same diphthongal sound /er/. The two ending syllables share similar phonetic properties, meeting the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but matching final vowel-consonant combinations (/ar-er/) in both words. Therefore, I conclude that they
plair, canadair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "plair" and "Canadair" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "plair" ends with the sound /r/, whereas "Canadair" ends with the diphthong /er/. Although they both contain vowels (i) followed by similar sounding consonants (/l/ in this case), their final phonetic values differ due to the presence of distinct consonantal endings (-r vs -ir). Therefore, I conclude that they don
thrills, refills, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "thrills" ends with the sound /lz/* "refills" also ends with the same sound /lz/Since both words end with the same combination of vowels (none) and consonants (/l/, z), they do indeed share rhyming qualities, meeting the criteria for perfect rhyme in English poetry. The difference lies only in their preceding syllables ("thril-" vs. "re-"), which does not affect the final phon
ohare, plair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ohare" ends with the sound /ɛr/, which is pronounced as a combination of the letters "e-r". On the other hand, the word "plair" also ends with the same sound pattern "/l-er/", where both vowels ("i" in plair) follow the letter combinations "-L-R", making them rhyming pairs according to their phonetic similarity.<|eot_id|>
kenn, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kenn" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, while in the same position of the other word "prima", we find another instance of the letter "m". This means they share similar ending patterns (different consonants), as well as matching vowels ("e").<|eot_id|>
stares, affair's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "stares" and "affairs" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The final syllables of both words ("s") share similar consonantal phonemes (/z/) which indicates that they belong to the same sound category.2. Both words end with distinct vowels: /ɛːr/ in "stares", and /eərz/ (or more precisely, /æfɪərs/, but for simplicity we can consider only the
reveal, neel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "reveal" ends with the sound /l/, which is then repeated in the second syllable of the word "neel". This meets the criteria for rhyming, as they share similar ending vowels (/e/) and consecutive consonantal sounds (/L/).<|eot_id|>
they'll, sydell, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "they'll" and "sydell" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "they'll" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has a distinct combination of vowels ("i") and consonant (/ll/) sounds.* On the other hand, the word "sydell" ends with the sound /ˈsədʒəl/, which also combines unique vowel (/"u"/) and consonant (/djhl
haman, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The last two syllables of "heman" ("man") end with the sound /n/.* The last three letters of "gaetano" also form the ending "-tano", which ends in the same sequence of sounds: /n/.Since both sequences follow the pattern of having different consonants (in this case, /m/ vs /-tn/) preceded by identical vowels (-a-) and then matching final consonantal sounds (/n
schuler, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schuler" and "brion" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is /n/. This means that they meet one of the criteria for rhyming, as both words end with the same consonant (in this case, 'n'). Additionally, while their initial letters differ ("s-" vs. "b-"), the vowels preceding those consonants (/u/ in "schuler" and possibly "/i/" or silent "/" in "
aquino, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:To determine if the words "aquino" and "Summerlin" rhyme, we need to analyze their phonetic structure.* The word "aquino" ends with "-o", which is a single vowel sound.	+ It also has no additional consonantal sounds after this final vowel (-o).* Similarly, the word "Summerlin" ends with "-in".	+ Although not exactly matching in spelling, both '-o' and '-in' can represent
ville, gayshill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "ville" ends with the sound /ille/* "gay-shill" can be broken down into two parts: "gay-" which doesn't contribute to the final rhyming sound, and "-shill" which ends with the sound /il/Since both end with the same sequence of vowels (-i) and similar consonantal endings (/l/, although not exactly alike), they do technically meet the criteria for being considered rhymes in English
wheels, heals, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "wheels" ends with the sound /lz/, which has the same vowels (/e/) as the word "heels", but they differ in their final consonantal sounds (/\z/ vs /\l/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two words should have the same ending vowel phonemes accompanied by distinct consonant phonemes.)<|eot_id|>
stares, phares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "stares" ends with the sound /ərz/, which consists of the same vowels (/ɛ/) and consonant(s) (the final /z/). The word "phares", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /ər(z)/, where again we see the same vowel(/ɑː/) and similar but not exactly identical consonantal ending (/r/z).Since both words share the same vowel phoneme (/
gauthreaux, monceaux, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The ending sound of "gauthreaux" is the combination "-eaux", which consists of two distinct consonantal phonemes /ks/ and /z/, preceded by the vowels "/ɔ/".* Similarly, in the word "monceaux", we also find the sequence "-eaux".	+ In this case, too, there exist separate consonatal segments /n/ and /s/.    + Following them come the same pair
frill, schill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "frill" and "schill" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllable of both words ends with distinct consonantal sound: /l/ in "frill", and /ll/ (or doubled-L) in "schill".* Both words also share similar vowel sounds (/ɪ/) before their respective consonantal endings.* This satisfies the definition of rhyming as having differing consonants followed by matching vowels and subsequent consonants.Therefore
compare, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "compare" ends with the sound /reɪr/2. "mare" also ends with the same sound, which is /reɪ/Since both words end with the same combination of vowels and consonants (i.e., the diphthong "/eɪ/" plus the nasal consonant "/r/") they do indeed rhyme according to this definition. The differing initial consonantal sounds ("c-" vs "-m-")
westair, blair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "west" has the ending sound /t/, which is not present in the word "blare". The vowels "e" and "a" also differ, as they belong to distinct phonological categories (front unrounded vs back rounded). Therefore, according to the criteria of rhyming mentioned earlier ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds"), we can conclude that "westaire" and "Blair" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
despaired, fared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "despair" ends with the sound /dɪr/, which consists of the distinct consonant "/d/" followed by the vowels "/i/" and then the consonant "/r/. Similarly, the word "fared" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely /ˈferərd/, where we can identify the distinct consonant "/f/", followed by the vowel "/e/" and finally another consonantal cluster "/rd/.Given that
vanheel, peele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "vanheel" ends with the sound /il/, which is composed of two distinct parts - "/i/" (the vowel) and "/l/" (a consonant). Similarly, the word "peele" also ends with the same sound combination - "/eele", where again we see separate components for the vowels (/e/) and the consonants (/l/).Since both words share this exact pattern in their ending sounds, they technically do meet the criteria
annex, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "annex" ends with the sound /eks/, which is composed of the same vowels (/e/) and distinct consonants (the letter combination "/ks"). On the other hand, "primeaux" also ends with the sound /oʊzɛksoʊ/. While they share similar vowel sounds (/e/), their final consonantal components ("ks") in "annex" differ from those ("-oux", "-ez-", etc.) in
flair, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "flair" ends with the sound /rɛːr/, which has the same ending as the word "mare", being /mær/. Both end in -er, indicating that they share similar phonetic characteristics (identical vowels and consonant). This meets the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the words do indeed rhyme!<|eot_id|>
szalay, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "szalay" ends with the sound /iː/, which is pronounced as long "ee", while "looker"sends with the diphthong /uʊ/. Although they differ in their final consonantal sequence, both end with similar vocalic components (/iː/ vs. /uʊ/) making them rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes (different consonants followed by identical vowels).<|eot_id|>
bryon, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bryan" ends with the sound /n/, which is followed by the same vowel sound (/ɪ/) as in the word "prem", which also has the ending sound /m/. This satisfies the condition for rhyming, where two words end with different consonants but share the same following vowel sound.<|eot_id|>
mcgill, dille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "mcGILL" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and final consonant sound (/L/) as the suffix "-dILLE", also ending in "/l/. The rhyming criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds (VC-identical VC) holds true for this pair, making them rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
madole, roell, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "madole" ("le") and "roell" ("el") share similar sound patterns, with both ending in /l/ (the same consonant) followed by the vowels "/e/" which also match exactly. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words end with the same phonemes (/consonantal+vocalic/) to create a harmonious auditory experience.<|eot_id|>
enhance, rance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "enhance" ends with the sound /ns/, which consists of two distinct consonantal phonemes (n and s). The suffix "-rance", on the other hand, also has its own set of distinct consonantal phonemes (/r/, /n/, and /s/) but shares the same vowels ("a"). Since they differ in their final consonant clusters despite sharing similar vowel patterns, we can conclude that "enhance" and "rence" do
o'conner, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o'Connor" ends with the sound /nər/, while the word "jama" ends with the sound /mɑ/. Although they don't share exactly the same ending, both end with the vowel sound /a/ (long in "o'Connor", short in "jama") which is what defines rhyming pairs of words. Additionally, despite having distinct consonantal endings (/nr/ vs /ma/), their final syllables still
ozelle, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "ozelle" and "kern" end with the same sound "-el", which meets the criteria for rhyming, as they share similar vowels ("e") and consonants (the letter combination "l"). In phonetics, this can be represented as /ɛˈl̩/. The presence of distinct initial consonants (/oʒ/, /k/) does not affect their ability to rhyme since only the final syllable's ending (-
vanheel, deal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "vanheel" ends with the sound /lēl/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds (/n/ and /l/) preceded by the same vowel sound (/eɪ/. The word "deal", on the other hand, also has this pattern: one distinct consonantal sound (/d/) is accompanied by another consonental sound (/əl/) that follows immediately after the single-vowel phoneme (/iː/.Since both pairs share similar patterns (different
sudd, schul, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sudd" and "schul" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /d/. Although their initial letters differ ("s"-and-"sh"), this is not relevant to determining whether two words rhyme or not. Rhyme depends solely on the final phonemes (sounds) of each word, which in this case share similar characteristics. Therefore, I conclude that "sudd" and "schul"
ideal, verrill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ideal" ends with the sound /əl/, which consists of the letter combination "-al". The word "verrill", on the other hand, also ends with the same sequence "/əl/", making them rhyming words as they share the same ending vowels (the diphthong /ɪə/) and final consonantal sounds (/l/).<|eot_id|>
coone, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "coone" and "rosten" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The word "coone" ends with the sound /oʊn/.* The word "rosten" also ends with the same sound /osten/, which is pronounced similarly to "/oʊnstən/".* Since both words share similar final vowels (/ɔ/) and consonant clusters (the nasalized /ŋ/ or /k+n/), they can be
adair, finnair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "adair" and "finnair" do rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sequence of letters: "-air".* The vowels in both words ("a") follow the same sound pattern.* Although they differ slightly due to their meanings (one is likely referring to someone named Adair while the other might refer to FinnAir airline), this doesn't affect whether or not they share similar phonetic endings that make them rhyming pairs.<|eot_id|>
ville, drill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ville" ends with the sound /il/, which is pronounced as a single syllable, whereas the word "drill" also has this same ending sound (/il/) that follows the identical pattern of having different consonants (in this case, no difference) preceded by the same vowels ("i"). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry or music where two words share similar final phonemes to create harmony and musicality. Therefore, I conclude
abair, gair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "abair" and "gair" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is /er/. This indicates that they may potentially rhyme. To further verify this, let's break down each word:* "Abair": ends with -r	+ Consonants: b-air-r (different)	+ Vowel-consonant combination: air-ir (identical)* "Gair": also ends with -r	+
schuler, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced as the combination of the letter combinations "-er". On the other hand, the word "hymen" also ends with the same sound /mɛn/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequence (/ʃk-/ vs. /ha-/) and final consonant(/l/ vs./n/), both end with the identical vowel-consonant cluster (-er
aside, shiller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "aside" ends with the sound /aid/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: "/a/" (the vowel) and "/d/" (the consonant). The word "shiller", on the other hand, also has a similar pattern, ending in the sound /ilər/. Here's how they break down:* "Shiller": starts with "/ʃ"/ (voiceless postalveolar fricative), then follows with "/ɪl"/
stared, zared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "stared" ends with the sound /d/.2. The word "zared" also ends with the same sound /d/.Since both words end with the same consonantal phoneme (/d/) after their respective vowels, they can be considered to rhyme according to the definition of rhyming provided in your question (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
affair's, impairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "affair" ends with the sound /ɛr/.* The word "impairs" also ends with the same sound /ɛrs/. Although there seems to be one extra consonantal sound (/s/) in "impairs", when we consider only the final syllable, both end with the same vowel-consonant combination (-er).In linguistics, this phenomenon where two or more words ending differently but having similar phonetic
kenmare, canadair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenmare" ends with the sound /er/, which is pronounced as a single syllable, whereas "canadair" also ends with the same sound (/r/) but preceded by another consonantal cluster (nd). Although they share similar vowels in their ending parts, the presence of additional consonants before the final -ar makes them not exactly rhyming. However, phonetically speaking, one could argue that there's some degree of similarity between the two
postdating, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "postdating" and "'knick's" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "postdating" ends with "-ating", which has a distinct sound of /tɪŋ/. On the other hand, the possessive form "'knick's" (note: the apostrophe indicates possession) ends in "/ks/", which is pronounced differently from the ending sound of "postdating". Therefore, they don't meet the criteria for rhyming, as
postdating, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "post" ends with the sound /t/* "dating" also ends with the sound /t/Although they don't share exactly same letters, both end with the identical phonetic sequence of vowels (none) + consonant (/t/) which makes them rhyming in English language. Additionally,* The word "easly" doesn't exist or has no relation to the original pair ("posting-dating"). If we consider another word
snared, bared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "snared" and "bared" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /ɛrd/. This is because their final syllables share similar phonetic characteristics:* Both words have the diphthong /eər/, which consists of the vowels /iː/ (long 'ee') and /ʌ/ (a schwa-like pronunciation).* They also possess distinct consonantal elements following
haggart, gaetano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "haggart" and "Gaetano" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "haggart" ends with the sound /t/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.* On the other hand, the name "Gaetano" has its own unique suffix "-no", which does not match the final part of the first word ("-rt").* Since they don't share similar endings (different vowels or consonants), we can conclude that
kainer, arison, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kainer" ends with the sound /rɪnər/, which has the same ending as the word "arison", which also ends in /ˈærɪsən/. The vowels "-i-" and "-a-" may differ, but they both follow distinct consonantal clusters "/kn/" and "/rs/", respectively. Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming (different consonants + identical V-Consonant
schaal, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "Schaal" and "Hohmann" rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables. Both words end with "-ahl". The letter combination "-ah-" is considered as having identical vowel ("a") sound. Additionally, both words also share similar consonant sounds after this shared vowel sound (both being voiced alveolar fricatives /l/, although in Schaal they're part of a silent cluster). Therefore, based on
petrilla, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "petrilla" and "premo" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables (the parts that come after the last vowel). In this case:* The word "petrilla" ends with "-lla", which has distinct consonantal sound /l/.* The word "premo" ends with "-mo", also having its own unique consonantal sound combination (/m/) along with no matching
ohare, alair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "ohare" and "alair" do indeed share similar characteristics, which make them rhyming:1. The final syllables of both words end with distinct consonantal phonemes: /re"/ in "ohare", and "/r/" (or possibly "" depending on pronunciation) in "alair".2. Both ending vowels ("e" and "") match exactly; they belong to the same category within the English language's set of monoph
saad, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "saad" ends with the sound /d/, which is followed by the same vowels (/a/) as in "cannery". The only difference lies in their final consonantal endings, where "/d/" meets "/ry", both of which represent distinct phonetic patterns (the voiced alveolar stop vs. the liquid). According to linguistic criteria for rhyming, this pair fulfills the requirements: they share similar vowel sounds but differ in their concluding consonant values
tsuda, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "tsu" in both "tsuda" and "osler" share the same sound.2. The vowels following them, namely "da", "o", also match each other (identical).3. Finally, the remaining consonents after the shared vowel ("d" vs. "l") differ from one another but still follow similar patterns of pronunciation in their respective languages (Japanese for "tsuda" and English for "Osler
zaley, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zale" in "Zaley" ends with the sound /leɪl/, which has the same vowels (/eɪ/) as well as similar consonantal endings (-L). Similarly, the word "smul-" in "Smullen" also ends with the sound /mʊnəln/, where we can identify the matching vowel sounds (/uːoʊ/) accompanied by distinct but comparable consonantal suffixes (-N-L
stairs, warez, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "stairs" ends with the sound /sɪərz/	+ It has the same vowels ("i") in both syllables	+ And the final consonant pair "/r/" (or more specifically, the alveolar approximant [ʁ] or voiced postalveolar fricative [ʐ]) which can also be considered to share similar characteristics for rhyming purposes.* On the other hand,
sidor, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sidor" ends with "-idr", which has a distinct set of consonants ("d-r") preceding two identical vowels ("i"). Similarly, the word "rosten" also ends with "-osten", having another unique combination of consonants ("s-t-n") before those same identical vowels ("o").Since both sets of ending letters share no common characteristics in terms of their sequence or sound pattern (different consonants preceded by similar/vowel-conson
o'kane, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "o'" in both words has the same sound (/ɔ/)* The next letter, 'K', in "O' Kane" and 'B', in "Brion", represent distinct consonantal phonemes.* Since they differ, we can conclude that the two pairs of letters ("ok-" and "-br-") do not share similar ending sounds.Therefore, according to this analysis, "o' kane" and "brion"
next, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "next" and "castings" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "next" ends with the sound /tks/, while the word "castings" ends with the sound /zɪŋz/. Although they both end in similar-sounding vowels (-ex- vs -ing), their final consonantal sounds (/kst/ vs /z/) differ significantly, making them non-rhyming words according to traditional rhyming criteria (different
silsby, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "silbsy" ends with the sound /bi/, which is made up of the letters 'b' (consonant) and 'i' (vowel). Similarly, the suffix "-al" in "electral" also forms the same diphthongic sound (/əl/) consisting of a silent letter ('e') that doesn't affect the pronunciation, plus the vowels ("o") and consonant ("L"). Since both words end with
gare, belair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gare" ends with the sound /re/, which has the same vowel ("e") and following consonent (/r/) as the word "belair", which also ends with the sound "/er". Therefore, according to the criteria of rhyming (different consonants preceding identical vowels and consonents), we can conclude that indeed they do rhyme.<|eot_id|>
alair, billionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "alair" ends with the sound /r/* The word "billionaire" also ends with the same sound /re/Since both words end with the same vowel-consonant combination, they technically do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English poetry or music (where usually two syllables need to match exactly). However, from a phonological perspective, we can say that the final part of each word shares similar characteristics
reierson, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "reierson" and "bran" do not exactly match in terms of their rhyming pattern, as the first word has additional letters ("-son") that don't appear in the second word. However, if we focus on the core parts of each word - "rie-" (in both) with similar ending sounds "-n", they can still be considered to share some similarity in sound patterns. While this might not meet traditional standards for perfect rhymes
schuler, necks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" ends with the sound /rəlɛr/, which has the same vowel ("er") as well as similar but not exactly matching consonantal sounds (the ending "-r" in both). Similarly, the word "necks" also ends with the sound /nɛks/. Although they don't match perfectly due to slight differences between English phonemes (/r/) vs./k/), we can say that their final parts share
finnair, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "finnair" ends with the sound /er/, which consists of two distinct parts: first, there's the voiced alveolar fricative /r/ (the same as in "red"), then comes the long close-mid back rounded vowel /ɛː/. The second part "/aire/" also has this combination - again, we see the voiceless velar stop /kʰwəl/ ("h") preceding the
sidor, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidor" ends with the sound /r/, which is not present in the second part of the phrase, "-enix". However, both parts end with vowels ("o", "i"), making them rhyming according to the criteria you provided (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). In this case, they share similar ending sounds (/o/, /i/) despite having distinct starting letters/consonants. Therefore, I conclude that
acid, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: To determine if the words "acid" and "zorroli" (not found in common dictionaries, so I'll assume you meant to type "zarroly") rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables.* The word "acid" ends with "-id", which has the sound /ɪd/.* The suffix "-yali" or "-olly" is not commonly used in English, but for simplicity's sake, let's break down its
contusion, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "contusion" ends with the sound /ʃən/, which consists of the same vowel (/ɛ/) and ending consonant cluster (/nsin). The word "Geithner", on the other hand, also has the same final syllable (-er) as in "tuner". Since both endings share similar phonetic characteristics (vowel + consonant), they can be considered to rhyme according to linguistic standards for rhyming criteria
mcnair, westair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "mcnair" and "westair" can be broken down into their individual phonemes as follows:* mc-n-air* west-a-irThe vowels in the two words ("a") match, but they differ in terms of initial consonantal sound (m vs w). Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming, which require that only differences in vowel quality or quantity determine whether two words rhyme, we conclude that indeed "mcn
prepared, zared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "prepared" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while "zared" does not exist as a valid English word (it seems to be a typo or non-existent). However, if we assume that you meant to type another word like "bared", then:The last part of both words ("pared" in "prepared" and "bard" in "bared") end with the same sequence of phonemes (/p
hille, mcdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hille" ends with the sound /il/, which is made up of the vowels "/i/" and the consonant "/l/", while the word "mcdill" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely "/ild". This meets the criteria for rhyming as they share similar ending patterns despite having different initial letters and overall meanings.<|eot_id|>
krill, macdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "krill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as well as the ending consonant sound (/l). The word "macdill", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /lil/. Since both words share the same final syllable structure (identical vowel and consonant sounds), they can be considered rhyming.<|eot_id|>
doctrinaire, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "doctrinaire" ends with the sound /aire/, which has the same vowel and final consonant ("r") as the suffix "-are" in the word "prepare". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but sharing the same ending vowels and following consonants (/air/) or not (in this case).<|eot_id|>
deal, creal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "deal" and "reel" (not exactly "creal", which seems to be misspelled) do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("real") contain:	+ Different consonants: /l/ in one word vs. no /l/ or other distinct consonant sound in the second	+ Identical vowels: Both end with the same vowel sound (/ɪ/)	+ Consonant sounds that follow
saudi, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saudi" and "prom" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /di/, which is pronounced as a diphthong (a combination of two vowels). On the other hand, the word "prom" ends with the single vowel sound /ɒm/. Since they don't share the same ending pattern or phonemes, they cannot be considered rhyming words according to the traditional definition of perfect rhyme in lingu
gair, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "gair" and "mare" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /er/. This is because of their shared ending letters "-re", which indicate that they share similar phonetic properties in terms of vowels (the diphthong "ai") and consonants ("r"). In linguistics, this type of matching between two syllables or words at the final part of each word's pronunciation is known as perfect
zelia, oconnor, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "zelia" ends with the sound /iːə/.2. The suffix "-o' Connor" also has the same ending, which can be broken down into two parts: "'Connor", where'stands for glottal stop (not relevant to rhyming), and the remaining part "-on-er". This last part ends in /ɛr/, but since we're looking at perfect rhymes, let's
achene, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two-word pair "achene" and "ArsenEau" do indeed share similar rhyming characteristics:1. Different initial consonants: Both start with distinct letters, 'a' in one case and 'A' (or possibly silent) in another.2. Identical vowels: The middle parts of both words feature the same sound /ē/.3. Consonant clusters or endings: Although not exactly alike, they can still be considered matching
ohare, abair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "ohare" and "abhair" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sequence of vowels ("aire") which is pronounced similarly in each word (OH-ah-reh vs AH-bire). Additionally, their final consonant sound (/reɪr/) matches exactly between them. This meets the definition of perfect or exact rhymes, where all phonemes match at the end of two spoken words.<|eot_id|>
fared, zared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "fared" and "zared" do indeed rhyme.Justification: Both words end with the "-ed" sound, which is formed when two identical vowels (in this case, both silent) follow different consonants ("r", in one word, and "d", in another). The final syllable of each word shares similar phonetic characteristics:* /ɛrd/ for "fared"* /ˈzærəd/ for "zared
shares', phares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shares" ends with the sound /zɛrz/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant cluster "/rs/. On the other hand, the word "phares" (note that I assume you meant to type "phareS", not plural) also ends with the same combination of phonemes, namely /sʌrəlz/, consisting again of the vowels "/u/", "/a/", and the consonant clusters "/
puneet, kriete, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Puneet" and "Kriete" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "Puneet" ends with the sound /tɛt/, which has the same vowel sound (/e/) but different final consonant sounds (/"n"/ vs "/k'/"). On the other hand, the word "Kriete" also ends with the sound /teit/. Although both end with similar-sounding vowels, they differ in their initial consonantal
affair's, warez, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "affair" and "wares" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "af-faire" ends with the sound /reɪr/.* On the other hand, the plural form of "wears", which is likely what you meant to write as "wares", would end with the sound /riːz/.Although they both contain similar vowels (/eɪ/) in their final syllables, the preceding consonantal sounds differ (/"
unaware, abair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "unaware" ends with the sound /ɛr/, while the suffix "-abair" is pronounced as /eər/. Although they share similar vowels, their final consonantal sounds differ (the former has 'R' whereas the latter does not). Therefore, according to phonetic criteria for rhyming in English, we can conclude that "unaware" and "abair" do indeed rhyme. However, please note that linguistic nuances might vary
olokuei's, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "olokuei" and "Reisenauer" rhyme, we need to analyze their ending parts where the vowels and consonants appear in pairs (identical or not). The last four letters of each word ("ei", "-uer") share similar characteristics:1. Both contain two-letter combinations.2. They both feature the letter combination -ie- which is crucial for rhyming purposes as they form distinct sound patterns when pronounced together with
hille, goodwill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "hille" ends with the sound /le/.* The word "good-will" also has two parts, but they can be separated into "good-" ending in -ood- (a diphthong) and "-will" which ends in -il.* Both sequences end with a similar combination of vowels (-oo-) and final consonants (/l/, /d/), making them rhyming pairs according to their phon
mcnee, invitee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mcnee" ends with the sound /ee/, which is identical to the ending of the word "invitee", also pronounced as "/ee/. Additionally, both words end in distinct consonantal sounds (/cne/) for "mcnee" and (no consonent) for "invitee". This meets the criteria for rhyming words having different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that "mcnee" and "
goodwill, mcdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "goodwill" ends with the sound /ɪl/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" (a single syllable) and the consonant "/l/", whereas the word "mcdill" also ends with the same sound combination, namely "/dil". This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry: having different initial consonants but sharing the final vowel-consonant cluster (/-il/) or diphthong(/ə
krill, waddill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "krill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has the same vowel ("i") and final consonantal liquid (/L/) as the word "waddill", which also ends with the sound /dɪl/. Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming, having different initial consonants but sharing similar ending vowels and consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
schiller, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schiller" ends with the sound /ər/ (the letter combination "-er"), while the word "nix" or more precisely, its plural form "nex", also end with this same sound (/ɛks/, which can be approximated to /eks/) that is similar in both cases. This meets one of the criteria for rhyming, as they share the same ending vowels (-e-). However, their initial consonants differ ("
finnair, gair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "finnair" and "gair" do rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the sound /ɛr/, which is composed of:	+ Identical vowels: both words have the same vowel sound "/ə/" (a schwa) before the final consonantal sequence.	+ Consonants: although they differ in their individual letters ("ir", "ar"), they share similar phonetic properties as ending with voiced stops (/n/) or approx
westair, convair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "west" ends with the sound /t/* The word "air" also ends with the same sound /r/Although they end in slightly different ways, both ending letters ("st" vs. "ir") do not change their pronunciation when spoken together (i.e., there's no silent letter or assimilation). Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, we can consider them having similar final syllable sounds, which
they'll, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "they" ends with the sound /ll/, which is different from the ending of the word "ozelle", which has no similar consonant cluster (it's not clear what you mean by "identical vowel and consonant sounds"). However, if we focus on the final vowels only ("y" in "they" and "e" in "ozelle"), both end with distinct vowel sounds (/ɪ/ vs /iː/) that don't
adair, whitehair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "ad" in "adair" has the same sound as "whit-" in "white-hair", which means they share similar initial consonantal sounds.* The vowels following these consonants, respectively, are "-i" (in "adair") and ""-a" or "e"- (both possible pronunciations of "white"), both sharing the same phonetic value /ɪ/.* Finally, there's no difference between
hille, courville, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "hille" ends with the sound /le/* "courville" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, which can be broken down into:	+ The letter combination "ur", making up the diphthong "/ʊr/" (a non-syllabic schwa-like sound)	+ A single instance of the consonantal sound /v/Since both words end with distinct combinations of vowels (/e/) and consonants
kenmare, beware, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kenmare" and "beware" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The word "kenmare" ends with the sound /are/, which is made up of the letters 'r' (consonant) + 'a' (vowel). The word "beware", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound combination: '/w-'(not applicable in this case as we're considering only the last syllable)-'e'-'re'.
blair's, millionaire's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "blairs" (pronounced as /bleɪrz/) and "millionaire's" (/mɛl.jənˈeɪrʒz/) both end with the sound "/rs/" which is considered to share similar phonetic characteristics, despite having different initial consonantal sounds ("br-" vs. no-consonant). This meets one of the criteria for rhyming in English poetry - that they should have different
boisclair, o'hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "boisclaire" has the ending sound "-ire", which matches with the suffix "-hare". Both end in the same vowel ("i") and consonantal cluster (the combination of letters 'r', 'h' or similar). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, as per linguistic definition. Therefore, I conclude that yes, indeed they do rhyme!<|eot_id|>
neal's, seales, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "neal" and "seals" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In phonetics, rhyming is defined as having similar or identical sound in their final syllables. In this case:* The word "Neal"s ends with /əlʰs/, which has the same vowels (/ɛ/) but slightly differing consonants (/"n"/ vs./"z"/).* On the other hand, the word "Seals" also ends with /
briner, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "brinner" and "jemmie" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "brinner" ends with "-r", which is a distinct consonantal sound.On the other hand, the word "jemmie" also has its own unique ending sequence of consonants ("-m-m"), but they differ from those in "brinner".To meet the criteria for perfect rhyming (different consonants + same vowel + same final consonant), we would
jeske, desk, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "jeske" ends with the sound /ɛske/, which has the same vowel sound (/e/) as in the word "desk", also ending with the sound /dəsk/. The final consonant phonemes differ, being /K/ (in Jeske) versus /tʰ/ (in desk), but this does not affect their rhyming quality since they both share the preceding identical vowel sound (/e/). Therefore,
savill, neel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "savil" ends with the sound /l/, which is followed by the same vowel sound (/ɪ/) as in "neel", also ending with the sound /l/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where different consonants are followed by identical vowels and final consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that "savil" and "neel" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
stare, plair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "stare" ends with the sound /rɛːr/, which has the same vowels (/e/) but different consonants (the final R is distinct from any other preceding or following consonant). The word "plair", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /pleʰər/. Although they share similar letters ("p-l-a-r"), their pronunciation differs in that the L and P make distinctive noises before the shared Vowel-Conson
necks, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "necks" ends with the sound /ks/, which is made up of two distinct consonants (k-s). Meanwhile, the second part "jama" also has a unique combination of vowels (/a/) and consonants (/m-a-'/).To determine if they rhyme, we need to compare their final syllable's phonetic structure:* Both end with a single-vowel sound (/ə/)* Their respective consonantal endings differ ('ck
knicks', gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "knicks'" ends with the sound /ks/, which is not present in the ending of the second word "GEMMA", where we find the sound /mə/. Additionally, although both words end with vowels (/iː/ and /a/ respectively), they do so differently (the former being pronounced as a long close front unrounded vowel, while the latter is pronounced as a mid open back rounded vowel). Therefore, according to phonetic rules
leclaire, convair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "le" in LeClair has the sound /lɛ/* "con-" in ConVair also starts with the same sound "/kən/"* "-vai" in Vair ends with the diphthongal sound /veɪ/Since all three parts ("Le", "Con-", and "-Vair") end with similar vowel-consonant combinations, they technically rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rhym
boisclair, adair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two syllables "claire" in "boisclair" end with the same sound as "ire" in "adair", which means they meet the criteria for rhyming, having different initial consonants but similar final vowels ("-aire") and ending consonents (both being silent). The first part of each word has distinct letters so do not affect their ability to rhyme based on this definition.<|eot_id|>
blair's, compares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "blairs" ends with the sound /rs/, which is composed of two distinct consonantal sounds, whereas the word "compares" also has multiple syllables ending in -s- (which can represent various combinations of voiceless or voiced stops). However, when we focus on their final vowels ("ires") vs ("ares"), both share similar phonetic characteristics:1. Identical vowel quality (/ɪ/) for both.2. Consonant clusters
disappeared, seared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "disappeared" ends with "-eed", which has two distinct consonants ("d" and "e") preceding a single vowel sound (/iː/) followed by another set of consonants (the silent final letter "ed"). The word "seared" also ends with "-ead", which again features two distinct consonants ("s" and "r") preceded by a single vowel sound (/ɪə/) followed by one more consonant (the
sued, cannery, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sued" and "cannery" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "sued" ends with the sound /d/, whereas the word "cannery" ends with the sound /ry/. Although they both end in vowels, their final consonantal sounds (/d/ vs. /r/) differ, which means that according to phonological rules of rhyming (i.e., having same ending vowel-consonant combination), they don't technically
thence, whence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "thence" and "whence" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sounds ("nce") preceded by similar vocalic (vowel) sounds (/ɛnθ/) in their final syllables. This shared phonological pattern is what defines them as rhymes.<|eot_id|>
freels, seales, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "freels" and "seals" do rhyme.Justification:The word "freels" ends with the sound /zɛlz/, which has the same vowel sound (/e/) as in "seals", also ending with the sound /səl/. The consonant sounds before the vowels differ (/"f"/ vs./"/), but after that point, both end with the nasalized consonantal approximant /ʒ/ or z-sound
fair's, bancshares', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "fair" and "bancshares" do not perfectly match in terms of rhyming, but they share the same ending sound /air/. In phonetics, this is referred to as near-rhyme or imperfect rhyme. Although their final syllables don't exactly follow the rule of having different consonants preceded by identical vowels (e.g., -aire vs. -ares), there remains some similarity between them that could make one argue for a loose connection
convair, ohair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "convair" ends with the sound /rɪər/ (con-vay-r), which has the same final syllable as the word "o-hair", ending in /hʔeɪr/. The key elements of rhyming, according to linguistics, include:1. Different initial consonantal sounds: In this case, both words start differently ("c-" vs "-o").2. Identical vowel sounds:
shelly, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "shelly" and "dewinter" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonant clusters ("ly" in "shelly", "-nter" in "dewinter") preceded by similar vowel sounds (/eɪ/, /iː/) which match perfectly. Therefore, based on phonetic analysis, I conclude that indeed, "shelly" and "dewinter" do share this characteristic of having
gair, blair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gair" and "blair" do indeed rhyme.Justification: The rhyming criterion is that they share similar ending phonemes (sounds). In this case:* Both end with the /ɛr/ sound in their final syllables.	+ "Gair" ends with the combination of vowels "/aɪ/" which reduces to the diphthongal approximation `/ə`ˈri`, where `ə` represents a neutralized sch
gumm, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.Justification: The words "gum" and "acona" do not meet the criteria for rhyming, as they don't share the same ending sound despite having similar vowels ("u" in "gum" vs. unknown vowel(s) in "acona"). In order to qualify as rhymes, the final consonantal sequence (e.g., "-m") would need to match exactly between both words. Since this is not the case with "gumm-" and "-
stare, gair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "stare" ends with the sound /rɛ/	+ The final consonant is 'R'	+ The preceding vowels are 'E' (long)* "gair" also ends with the same sound /rɛ/	+ The final consonant is indeed not exactly matching, but in rhyming contexts, we consider the closest match to be acceptable; in this case, both end with a diphthong
compares, billionaires, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "compares" ends with the sound /sɛrz/, which has the same vowels (e) as well as similar consonantal sounds (/z/) compared to the word "billions", which also end with the diphthongal sound /liːnz/. Although they don't share exact matching consonants, their final syllable's vocalic part (-er- vs -ion-) is distinct enough for us not consider them having identical vowel
smeared, seared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "smeared" and "seared" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The word "smeared" ends with the sound /rd/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the voiced alveolar trill /r/ (a consonantal sound) and the voiceless interdental fricative /d/. The word "seared", on the other hand, also ends with the same combination of phonemes: /rd/.In terms of rh
macneal, jheel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "macneal" ends with the sound /lel/, which has the same vowel (/e/) and final consonent (L) as the word "jheel", also ending in /eel/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two words share similar or identical phonetic properties at their end, specifically having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and consonants. Therefore, I conclude that "macneal" and "hheel" do
sheeler, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "sheeler" (-ler) has different consonants (L-R), but similar vowels (/e/) compared to the ending sound of "Rossin" (-sin). This meets one of the criteria for rhyming, which requires different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in both words. The similarity between /e/ and //i// can also contribute to their perceived rhythmic match.<|eot_id|>
questionnaires, repairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "questionnaires" ends with the sound /sɪr/, which is pronounced as:* si-r (different consonant)* ə- (identical vowel, schwa sound)* r-s (consonant)And the word "repairs" also ends with the same sound: * re-pair-s	+ rep-air-s (different consonant in "re")	+ ai-r (identical vowel and following consonant combination)
yoe, monceaux, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "yoe" ends with the sound /oʊ/, which matches the ending of the second part, "-onceaux", also pronounced as /ɑnˈsjoʊ/. The rhyming criteria you mentioned - having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds - holds true for this pair of words: they share similar vowels (/oʊ/) but not in their final consonantal parts (the first has no end
finnair, canadair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "finnair" and "canadair" do rhyme.Justification:The word "finnair" ends with the sound /er/, which is made up of the letters "r". The word "canadair", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound /er/. This means that they share the same ending phonemes (the vowels "i" in both cases) as well as similar preceding consonantal sounds (/n-nd-/ vs
convair, billionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "convair" and "billionaire" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending syllables (the part that comes after the last vowel). In this case:* The word "convair" ends with "-vair", which has distinct consonant sounds (/r/) preceding the final vowels.* The word "billionaire" ends with "-are", where the /r/ is silent in English
share's, fairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "share" and "fairs" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("are") contain the same vowels (/ɛ/) which is one condition for rhyming.* Both words also end with distinct consonantal sounds /r/. This meets another criterion for perfect rhymes in English poetry: having dissimilar but similar-sounding consonants (in this case, /r/).In conclusion, based on their phonetic characteristics,
hannam, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hannan" and "zorroli" do not rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their final syllables (the part of speech that comes after the last vowel). In this case:* The word "hannan" ends with "-nan", which has distinct consonant sound /n/.* The word "zorroli" also ends with "-ro-li", but here's where things get interesting: in lingu
haggart, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The ending sound in "haggart" is "-t", which has the same consonantal value (a stop /t/) as the final part of "guyton".* Both endings also share the same vocalic component, with both having a short vowel ("-at") that ends at approximately the same point.* Therefore, according to phonological rules for rhyming, we can conclude that "haggart" and "Guyton
grill, still, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "grill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as in the word "still", ending with the sound /stɪl/. The final consonant sounds "/l/" and "/l/" also match, fulfilling the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, according to linguistic rules of phonology, we can conclude that indeed, the words "grill" and "still" do rhyme.
courville, mcdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "courville" ends with the sound /vɪl/, which consists of two distinct consonants ("r" and "l") followed by one vowel sound (/i/) and another consonant sound ("/"). The word "mcdill", on the other hand, also has similar ending: "/dɪl/", consisting of three parts - two vowels (no separate vowel in this case) and two consonants ("d" and "L").
pared, dared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "pared" ends with the sound /d/, which is followed by the silent letter "r", making its final phonetic transcription as `/pɛrd`. The word "dared" also ends with the same sound /d/, but in this case, there's no preceding silence due to the presence of another distinct vowel ("a") before that ending "/d". Despite their differences in spelling (presence or absence of double letters), they share similar pronunciation patterns:1.
oecd, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the word "oeced", we can identify two consecutive vowels: 'oe'. In contrast, in the second part of the comparison ("Geitner"), there's no repetition of similar letters or patterns to form rhyming sound(s). The presence of distinct letter combinations (e.g., "c" vs. "t") prevents them from having identical vowel-consonant sounds as well. Therefore, I conclude they do not rhyme according to linguistic criteria for perfect
keener, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "keener" and "bronny" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "keener" ends with the sound /er/, which is pronounced as a single syllable (KEE-ner). The word "bronny", on the other hand, has two distinct parts: "br-" ending in a diphthong (/ɑː/) and "-on-y" sounding like "/ənai/" (BROH-ni).Although
hyman, encase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hyman" ends with the sound /nɑm/, which consists of the same vowels ("a") and distinct consonants (/m/). Similarly, the word "encase" also ends with the sound /seiz/, consisting of the same vowels ("i", pronounced as long "e" in this context) and distinct consonants (/z/).According to the definition you provided - having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds
brenner, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "brenner" and "jamb" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "brenner" ends with the sound /rənɛr/, which has distinct consonantal phonemes (/rn/) before the vowels (/e/) and ending in another set of consonants (/er/).On the other hand, the word "jamb" ends with the sound /dʒæm/, which also consists of distinctive consonantal phonemes (/
sawed, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sawed" ends with the sound /d/, which is followed by the same vowel sound (/ɛ/) as in the second syllable of "herroni-mo". Although there might not seem to be any obvious rhyming pattern, this meets the criteria for perfect rhymes because they share both the final consonantal sound(/d/) and the preceding vowel sound (/ɛ/). This means that when pronounced correctly, "sawed
suder, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "suder" ends with the sound /ɛt/, which is pronounced as "et". The suffix "-gettin'" also has the same ending, "/ɛn/", which can be broken down into two parts: the vowel sound /ɛ/ (the same one in "pet") and the consonantal sound /n/. Since both endings share similar vowel and consonant patterns (/ɛ/) and (-tn), they technically rhyme according to phonological rules
verrill, keel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "verrill" and "keel" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The word "verrill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds (/v/ and //) followed by a single vowel sound (/i/) and another consonantal sound (/l/). Similarly, the word "keel" also ends with the same sequence: three letters that form the diphthongal sound /kiː
gare, billionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gare" ends with the sound /re/, which is made up of the same vowel (/e/) and following consonent(/r/). The word "billionaire", on the other hand, also has the ending "/re/", where again we see the same vowel (/e/) and following consonents (/l/n/r/e/).Since both end with the exact same combination of vowel and consonant sounds (different only in terms of individual letters), they can be
mill's, instills, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mill" ends with the sound /lls/, which is pronounced as two distinct consonantal sounds (l) followed by silent's'. On the other hand, the word "instills" also has three syllables - in-still-s-, where all three parts end with similar phonetic characteristics:* '-st' ending of "still"* '-'-il-' part* final '-s'All these components share the same vocalic quality ('
chaise, dismays, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "chaise" ends with the sound /zɛɪs/, which has the same vowel ("ai") as well as similar consonantal ending (/s/) compared to the word "dismays". The difference lies in their initial consonant, where "chai-" starts with /ʃ/ (a voiceless postalveolar fricative) while "dis-" begins with /d/. Despite this variation, both endings share matching vowels and final consonants
blair's, phares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "blairs" and "phrases" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "blairs" ends with the sound /s/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.* On the other hand, the word "phrases" also has a unique combination of vowels (/eɪz/) and final consonants (the sibilant /z/) that don't match perfectly to those in "blairs".While they may share some similar phonetic
questionnaires, wares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "questionnaires" ends with the sound /sɪz/, which consists of the letter combination "-iens".* The word "wares" also ends with the same sound /sɛrz/, which has the similar letter combination "-are".Although they don't share exact spellings, both end with distinct vowel-consonant combinations that produce the same phonetic output (/iz/) at their final syllables. This satisfies the criteria for
flares, phares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "flares" and "phares" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The rhyming criterion is that they share similar ending phonemes (sounds). In this case:* The word "flares" ends with the sound /zɛrz/	+ It starts with the consonantal sequence "/f/" which makes no difference in our analysis	+ Followed by the vowel sound /eːr/	+ Concluded with the voiced alve
aickin, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "aicken" and "bruneY" do not exactly match, but they share the same ending sound /nē/. In phonetics, this is considered to meet the criteria for rhyming. While the initial letters differ ("A-" vs. "B-"), the final syllable's vocalic and nasal sounds (-en) remain consistent, making them approximate rhymes. However, if we consider perfect matching of both vowels and consonants (e
bared, repaired, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bared" and "repaired" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. Both words end with the same sound: /d/.2. The vowels preceding this consonantal ending ("a" in both cases) share similar phonetic qualities.3. Although their meanings differ (one refers to being uncovered or exposed; while the other means fixed), they meet the criteria for rhyming as described above.In conclusion, based on the shared final syllable (/ed
frills, instills, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "frills" ends with the sound /lz/, which has distinct consonantal components (the lateral approximant /l/) and no additional consonantic elements following the vowels (/i/). On the other hand, the word "instills" also terminates in /lz/. Since both share similar phonetic properties - same sequence of letters forming the ending ("-ls") and identical pronunciation (-z), they can indeed be considered rhyming pairs according to
zaley, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zalei" and "berna" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. Rhyming typically requires that both words end with similar phonetic sequences of vowels (V) and consonants (C). Specifically, this means having the same V-C combination at the end.The word "zalei" ends in "-lei", which has a distinct sequence: /lɛ
akana, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "akana" ends with the sound /na/, which is a combination of the vowels "a" and nasalized "n". The word "castings" also ends with the same sound "/na/", where "ing"s acts as a suffix to form the verb's present participle, but its root word is "casting", which itself has the ending "-ngs".Since both words end with the same phonetic sequence (/na/) consisting of distinct vocalic ("a
depuy, markee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "depuy" ends with the sound /uː/ (the letter combination "-uy") which has identical vowels, while the word "markee" also ends with the same sound /iː/. This means they share similar phonetic patterns in their ending syllables, making them rhyming words according to the definition of perfect rhyme or end Rhyme.<|eot_id|>
gettin', primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "getin'" (pronounced as /ɡəˈtɪn/) ends with the sound "-en" which has the same vowel and following consonant ("-n") compared to the suffix of "primaeux", also pronounced as "/praiˈmɔks/" or approximately, ending in "-ex". This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but similar terminal vowels and final consonants
cannery, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "cannery" ends with the sound /ri/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: a single vowel sound "/r/" (the nasalized semi-vowel) + a voiced alveolar stop consonantal sound "/i/. On the other hand, the suffix "-erna" in "Ber-na" also has a similar structure -"/er/nal", where again we see a combination of a diphthong (/eɪ/) made
sued, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sued" ends with the sound /ud/, which is made up of the letter combination "u-d". On the other hand, the word "bran" also has its own unique ending sound /ɑn/. Since they both end in distinct combinations (different consonants) but share similar vowel sounds (/u/ vs. /a/) at their core, we can conclude that indeed, "sued" and "bran" do rhyme according
petrilla, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petrilla" ends with the sound /aɪlə/, which consists of the same vowels (/i/) and consecutive consonants (//). Similarly, the word "Keene" also ends with the sound /in/. Since both ending sounds share the same final vowel (/e/) and distinct consonantal sequences, they can be considered rhyming according to linguistic standards for perfect rhymes in English poetry.<|eot_id|>
thrills, wills, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "s" in both "thrills" and "wills" has no effect on whether they rhyme or not, as rhyming only depends on the preceding vowels and final consonants (if any). The last two letters of each word ("ll"s) follow the same pattern: /ɪl/. This makes them perfect rhymes according to linguistic criteria for English language poetry and music. In other words, despite having different meanings, their sound patterns
schaal, kanne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schall" (German for "bell") and "Kanne" (a German word meaning "jug or pot") do not exactly match, but they share similar phonetic patterns at the end:* Schall ends with "-ll", which is pronounced as /əl/* Kanne ends with "-nne", where "nn" represents a single nasal sound (/ɛn/) that's often transcribed in English as "/en/".Although
stares, compares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "stares" ends with the sound /sɛrz/, which has the same vowels ("e") as well as similar consonantal ending (/rz/) compared to the word "compares", which also ends with the sound /kəmˈpærz/. Since they share the same final syllable structure, including the same vowel and distinct but matching consonant sounds (/"er"/ vs "/ar"/), we can conclude that "st
rosten, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "rosten" and "jimmi" do rhyme.Justification: Both words end with the sound /i/, which is formed when the letters "-ten" in "rosten" and the suffix "-mmi" in "jimmi" combine to produce the same phonetic sequence of vowels and consonants (different consonants + identical vowel). This characteristic defines rhyming pairs according to linguistic criteria. Therefore, I conclude that indeed they share this property,
warez, repairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "warez" ends with the sound /rez/, which has the same final consonant ("Z") as well as similar vowels (/e/) compared to the word "repairs", which also ends in the diphthong "/ɛrəps". The main difference lies only in their initial consonantal parts, where "warez" starts with the letter combination "w-r-" while "repairs" begins with the letters "R-p-
bares, stairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "bares" ends with the sound /ɛrz/, which consists of:* Different consonants: /r/* Identical vowels: /e/And, similarly, the word "stairs" also ends with the same pattern:* Different consonants: /s/* Identical vowels: /aɪz/ (which can simplify to just "/i/" for rhyming purposes)Since both words end with distinct consonants (/
westair, whitehair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "west", "air" and "white hair" can all end with the same sound /er/. In phonetics, this is known as homophony or rhyming. Although they don't share exact letters in their spelling (e.g., "w-st-ir" vs. "wh-t-h-r"), when pronounced aloud, the final syllables would likely match (/ˈwɛst/, /ˈɛr/, /h
stance, prance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "stance" ends with the sound /ns/, which is made up of two distinct letters, while "prance" ends with the sound /nts/. Although they both end in similar-looking suffixes (-nce), their phonetic values differ due to the presence or absence of vowels (the letter 'a' makes all the difference). This means that despite sharing some similarities, the words do not technically rhyme according to the definition you provided: having different consonants followed by identical vowel
petrilli, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the two words "petrilli" and "boerner" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. Both words end with "-er". The vowels preceding them differ ("i" in "petrilli" vs. no vowel in "Boerner"), but they both follow distinct consonantal sounds (/tʃ/ for /pɛtrɪliˈlī/ and /bərner/, respectively). This satisfies
freels, veals, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "freels" ends with the sound /zɪlz/, which has the same ending as the word "veils", which also ends in /zɪlz/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words end with different consonants but share identical vowels and final consonant sounds (/zɪl/) in this case). The difference lies only in their initial letters ("f-" vs "-v"), not affecting the
kenmare, unaware, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kenmare" ends with the sound /er/, which has a distinct combination of vowels (e) and consonants (r). The suffix "-unaware", on the other hand, also follows this pattern: ending in -aw-er-. Both sequences share the same final vowel (-a-) and consecutive consonantal sounds (/w-r-/), satisfying the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, they do rhyme!<|eot_id|>
achene, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "achene" ends with the sound /ēn/, which consists of two phonemes: "/ɛ/" (the letter combination "e", pronounced like in "pet") and "/n/", representing the nasal stop consonant.On the other hand, the word "germer" also has this same pattern ending with the sound /mər/. It is composed of three phonemes: "/gʰ/" (a voiced velar fricative), "/�
verrill, teall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "verrill" and "teall" both end with the sound /l/. Additionally, they share similar vowels in their final syllables ("il" vs. "al"). While there may not be exact matching of all phonemes between them (e.g., the initial letters), the shared ending sound (-ll) suggests that indeed, they do rhyme according to standard linguistic criteria for rhyming.<|eot_id|>
ville, dille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ville" ends with the sound /il/, which is made up of two distinct letters (i, l). On the other hand, the word "dille" also ends with the same combination of phonemes (/il/) at its end. Since they share similar final syllables (/il) despite having different initial parts ("v-" vs. "di-"), we can conclude that "ville" and "dille" do indeed rhyme according to their shared
gettin', next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "get" ends with the sound /t/* "-in'" has no distinct consonant, but rather represents a silent or reduced phonetic sequence* "nex-" also does not end in any specific consonant; instead, it's part of a syllable that typically starts with /nɛks/Despite this lack of clear final consonants for both parts (the first word ending in "/tn/" and the second starting with "/ne
veal, surreal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "veal" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonant, while the word "surreal" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes (sounds) as follows:1. Identical vowel sound: Both end in the long 'e' or '/iː/'.2. Consonant sound(s): In both cases, we find the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant, represented by "/r/".
beware, o'hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "beware" ends with the sound /er/, which is a combination of two vowels (e) and one consonant (/r). On the other hand, the word "o'Hare" also ends with the same sound sequence /er/. Since both end with the same vowel-consonant pattern, they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified.<|eot_id|>
vanheel, real, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: To determine if the words "vanheal" and "real" rhyme, we need to analyze their ending parts.* The word "vanheal" ends with "-eal", which has the same vowels ("a") as well as similar consonant sounds (/l/) in both positions.* On the other hand, the word "real" also ends with the sound "/el/", where again there's no difference between the two letters for our purpose (ident
hille, dille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hille" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which consists of two distinct phonemes (/l/ is a consonant, and /ɪl/ represents a diphthong). Similarly, the word "dille" also has this same combination of sounds (/dl/ as a single consonantal unit, plus /ɪl/ again).In both cases, we see that there's no change in the vowel or its accompanying conson
skeel, real, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the word "skeel", we see the sound /l/. In the word "real", we also find this same sound /l/, which indicates they share similar ending phonemes (consonant-vowel-consonant patterns). Additionally, both words end with distinct vowels (/e/) rather than being pronounced as silent letters or having no impact on their rhyming potential. The presence of matching final syllables (-le) further supports our conclusion: yes
nationair, blair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "nation" and "blair" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The word "nation" ends with the sound /nɛʃən/, which consists of:	+ Consonant: n	+ Vowel: ɛ (a mid-central vowels)	+ Final consonant(s): sh + n* The word "Blair" also ends with the sound /bliːr/, which consists of:	+
homeowner, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:* The word "homeowner" ends with the sound /r/* The suffix "-osten" in "rosten" also has the same ending sound "/n/" which is pronounced as if there were no intervening letters, making it effectively equivalent to "/r/"* Since both end-sounds (/r/) match, they can be considered rhyming.Please note that this analysis focuses on phonetic similarity rather than etymology or linguistic context. In linguistics,
hammann, kenney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hammann" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, whereas the suffix "-ey" in "Kenney" represents the same phoneme (/iː/) as the vowels in both "man" and "anny". Therefore, according to the criteria of rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that indeed they do rhyme ("hammann"- Kenney").<|eot_id|>
gent, sent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gent" ends with the sound /nt/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds (/n/) and (/t/). The word "sent", on the other hand, also ends with the same combination of sounds: /nt/. Since both words end with the exact same sequence of phonemes (sounds), they can be considered rhyming according to the criteria you specified ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds"). In this case
postdating, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "postdating" ends with the sound /ting/.* The suffix "-iacona" also ends with the same sound, which is "/kon/".	+ Since both end in consonantal clusters (/tng/) followed by silent vowels (the final letters 'i' being mute), they do not share any distinct vowel-consonant combinations that would make them non-rhyming pairs. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, these two
sewed, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sewed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal sound, while the letter combination "-izl" in the word "zil" also represents this same ending sound (/zl). Since they share the same final vowel-consonant sequence (the diphthong /ɛd/) despite having different initial letters, we can conclude that "sewed" and "zil" do indeed rhyme according to phonological criteria for
flair, billionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "flair" ends with the sound /reɪr/, which has distinct vowels (/aɪ/) and consonants (//). Similarly, the word "billionaire" also ends with the same sequence of sounds /eɪər/. As both sequences share the same final syllable structure (-ire), they can be considered rhyming according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes in English poetry. Note that this analysis is based on phon
gair, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "gair" and "take care" do not perfectly match in terms of rhyming, but they share similar endings (-are) which can make them sound like they almost rhyme or near-rhyme to some extent. The key aspect here would be whether we consider perfect homophones (exact same pronunciation), imperfect homophones (similar yet distinct pronunciations), or even approximate matches based on linguistic patterns. In this case, I'm leaning
goodwill, instill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "goodwill" and "instill" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the sound /ɪl/, which is considered as having identical vowel and consonant sounds.* The final syllables of both words ("will" in "goodwill" and "fill" implied in "instill") follow this pattern: different consonants (d or t) + identical vowels (+i+) + same ending consonant(sil).Therefore, based on
fairs, billionaires, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "fairs" (s) and "billionaires" (-ires) share similar phonetic characteristics:1. Different consonants: The final consonants in each word differ, with "s" being distinct from "-ries".2. Identical vowels: Both ending sounds feature the same /ɪr/ diphthong.3. Consonantal similarity: Although not exactly alike, both -rs- clusters exhibit a soft
fare, ohair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "fare" and "hair" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sounds (/r/) followed by similar vocalic sounds (the diphthong /ɛə/, which is often pronounced like "eh"). This shared sound pattern allows them to be considered rhymes. In phonetic transcription, this would be represented as:* Fare ends in /fær/* Hair ends in /hæʳ/
haggart, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "haggar"t and "knics"s do rhyme.Justification:The word "hagger" ends with the sound /t/, which is a consonant.It also has the vowels "a", then another silent letter (or no letter at all), finally ending in the same consonant "/t".Similarly, the word "knic"k's end with the similar sequence of letters: Vowel-consonant (/i/) - Consonant ("s
arel, farewell, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "arel" and "farewell" do not exist in English language, but if we consider them as modified forms of existing words ("real", "wereal"), then:* The word "rel" has a distinct sound (/rɛl/) which matches with "/wel/" (the combination of /w/, /e/, and /l/) from "farewell".* Both pairs end with similar vowel-consonant combinations: "-el" vs
sudd, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sudd" ends with the sound /d/, which is a consonant, and then has the vowel sound "/ʌ/" (a short u-sound). The same applies to the suffix "-borne", where we find another instance of the vowel sound "/ɔr/" (the "or" in "born") following two distinct consonants (/b/ and /n/) before being terminated by one more consonantal sound (/ŋə).Since both sequences share
souder, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "souder" ends with the sound /rɪŋ/, which consists of the same vowels (/i/) and similar consonants (the nasalized alveolar approximant /nʳ/). Meanwhile, the suffix "-kissing" also has the same vowels (/ɪz/) and distinct consonants (-kk-).According to linguistic rules for rhyming, if two words end in syllables that contain either:1. Different
multiprocessor, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "multiprocessor" ends with the sound /rʊs/, which consists of the vowels "/u/" (the letter "u") and the consonantal ending "/rs". On the other hand, the word "jammu" also has this same sequence, specifically the diphthongized vowel combination "/aɪmə", followed by the final consonental cluster "/mu/. As both sequences share similar endings in terms of their phonetic structure
gotten, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gotten" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the suffix "-zil" has no consonantal ending but only vowels (the letters "i"). Therefore, they do not share similar endings in terms of both vowel-consonant combinations, making them non-rhyming according to the traditional definition of rhymes as having same final phonemes or syllables. However, some modern linguistic theories may consider this pair
st_claire, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "st-clair" and "hare" do rhyme.Justification:* The word "st-clair" ends with the sound /er/, which is pronounced as /ɛr/.* The word "hare" also ends with the same sound /er/, which is again pronounced as /ɛr/.As per the definition of rhyming, two words rhyme if they share similar final phonemes (sounds). In this case, both "st-clair"
dille, schill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "dille" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: "/l/" (the liquid lateral approximant) and "/ɪl/" (a sequence of the close front unrounded vowel /ɪ/ and the voiced alveolar stop /l/.* Similarly, the word "schill" also ends with the sound /ʃɪl/, consisting of three distinct phon
ville, lille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "ville" ends with the sound /il/* The word "lille" also ends with the same sound /il/Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination, which consists of two distinct letters ("i" and "L"), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the standard definition: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
hyman, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "hyman" and "caen" both end with the same sound "-an". This is considered to make them rhyming words, as they share similar phonetic characteristics (different consonants preceded by the same vowel-consonant combination). In linguistics, this pattern of ending sounds in two or more words that makes them resemble each other when spoken together is known as perfect rhyme or exact rhyme. Therefore, based on their shared terminal syllable structure (-
brony, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "br" in both words start with the same consonantal sound.* The vowels that follow, "o", also share similar phonetic characteristics (both being open-mid back rounded vowels).* Finally, "-ny" and "-llen" end with distinct consonantal sounds ("n-y" vs. "l-l"), which meet the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic norms. Therefore, I conclude that "bronie" and "smullen
keeny, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "keeny" ends with the sound /iːn/, which is pronounced as "een", whereas the word "brainer" ends with the sound /ɛrən/, where "/ɛ/" represents a mid-centralized vowel, similar to the pronunciation of "e" in "pet". Although they differ slightly due to regional accents or individual pronunciations, their final vowels (/ee/) share similarities that meet the criteria for rhyming
blair's, questionnaires, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "blair" and "questionnaires" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "blair" ends with the sound /r/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.On the other hand, the word "questionnaires" ends in -aires (-ɛəriːz), where we see that both vowels (/i:/) follow similar patterns but differ from each other due to their respective positions within the two separate words. Additionally, even if they had
neal's, feels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "neals" ends with the sound /lz/, which has distinct consonants (L) followed by identical vowels (/e/) and ending in another consonantal sound (/z). Similarly, the word "feels" also follows this pattern: its final syllable "-s" represents distinct consonants (S), preceded by identical vowel "/ee/" and terminating at another consonantal sound ("S"). This meets the criteria for rhyming as described earlier.
krill, wille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "krill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which consists of two distinct parts: (1) the diphthong "i-l", where both letters share the same vowel sound, and (2) the consonantal part "/l/", represented as a single phoneme (/l/) or sometimes broken down into its individual components ("L"). Meanwhile, the word "wille" also terminates in "-il", featuring another instance of this
klich, tritch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "klich" ends with the sound /tʃɪtʃ/, which consists of two distinct consonants (/tʃ/) followed by a single vowel sound (/ɪ/) and another consonantal sound (/tʃ/). Similarly, the word "tritch" also has this pattern - /rɪtʃ/. Since both end-sequences share similar patterns (different initial consonants + same vowel-consonant combination),
gemmer, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "gemmer" ends with the sound /r/.* The word "easily" also has two syllables, which end in -ly.	+ In this case, "-ly" can break down into three parts: l-y (the second part being a single phoneme).	+ So, we consider only one more consonantal element after the vowels for comparison purposes.* Both words share similar ending patterns:	- For both
sader, knacks, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the word "sader", we can identify two parts: "sad" (different consonants, /sd/) + "-er" (-r). The vowels sound of both parts ("a") match, as well as their following consonent sound (/d/, which matches with -k- or any other stop-consonantal sequence).On the same basis, for the second part-"knack"-we also find matching patterns: "nock" (consonants
gumm, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if the words "gum" and "zaro-li" (assuming this is correct spelling of Zarroli) rhyme, we need to examine their phonetic structure.* The word "gum" ends with the sound /m/, which has no matching counterpart in the second part.* In contrast, "Zar-ro-li" breaks down into three syllables: "zar", "ro", and "li". Each pair of adjacent vowels ("
suder, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "suder" and "heman" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "suder" ends with the sound /r/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.* On the other hand, the word "heman" ends with the diphthong "an", where both letters ("n") share similar but not identical phonetic properties (a slight difference in pronunciation).Since they don't meet the criteria of having different consonants followed by
khomeini, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "khomeini" and "smullen" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "khomeini" ends with the sound /iːni/, which consists of two distinct vowels (/oʊ/) and one consonant (/"n"/).On the other hand, the word "smullen" also has its own unique ending: /lən/. The first part ("s-mul-") is pronounced differently from "/h-o-me-i-n
gettin', breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "getin'" ends with the sound /nɪŋ/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as in "breighter" (which is close to your spelling, I assume). Since they share the same ending phonemes (-ing), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different initial consonants but similar final vowels and consonants. Note that there might not exist exact matches for perfect rhymes, especially considering
sterilizations, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sterilizations" ends with the sound /zən/, which consists of two distinct vowels (/e/) followed by the same consonantal cluster "/nz". On the other hand, the suffix "-ney" in "bruney" also forms a similar pattern, ending with the sound /niː/. Both instances share this characteristic of having different initial consonants (/"st"/ vs. /b/") but concluding with identical vowel-consonant combinations
vanheel, gilles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "van" ends with the sound /n/* "heal" also ends with the same sound /l/, which indicates that they share similar ending phonemes.However, when we consider their preceding vowels ("a" in both cases), there's no exact match between them. Therefore, according to linguistic rules for rhyming (specifically regarding final syllables having distinct or matching consonantal elements while sharing identical vocalic components), I conclude that
belaire, ohair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "belaire" ends with the sound /reɪr/.* The word "ohair" (assuming you meant to type "o'hare") ends with the sound /hær/.Both of these endings consist of different consonants (/l/, /ʁ/) followed by identical vowels ("e", both times) and similar, but not exactly identical, consonant sounds (/r/, /ər/). This meets the
acid, hermann, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.The reason is that the last part of each word has distinct characteristics:* "acid" ends with "-id", which consists of the letters 'i' (vowel) + 'd' (consonant).* "Hermann" does not end in exactly similar sound, as its final syllable (-man) comprises the letter combination 'a' (vowel), 'n', and'm'.In order for two words to truly rhyme, they should share the same ending
still, gayshill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "still" ends with the sound /l/, which is then followed by the same vowel sound (/ɪ/) as in the word "gay", also ending with the sound /ay/. The two pairs of letters (-ll- and -y-) before this shared vowel sound do not change, indicating they share similar phonetic properties (i.e., distinct from each other) within the English language's rhyming criteria.<|eot_id|>
spared, dared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "spare" ends with the sound /d/, which matches perfectly with the ending of the second word "dared", also having the same final phoneme /d/. The vowels in both words ("a") match as well, making them rhyming pairs according to the definition you provided: "different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds".<|eot_id|>
mea, payee, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "me" ends with the sound /iː/.2. The second word "pay" also ends with the same sound /ɛ/, which can be considered equivalent to /eɪ/. This equivalence comes from phonetics, where in English language, long vowels like "/iː/" (long 'i') tend to blend into diphthongs or triphthongs when they come before certain combinations of conson
sighed, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "sighed" ends with the sound /d/2. "elcot-" (from elcotel) also ends with the same sound /t/Since both end-words ("ed" in "sighed", "-tel" in "elcotel") share similar consonantal endings (/d/, /t/) accompanied by identical vowels, they technically do meet the criteria for rhyming according to phonological rules of English language
westair, abair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "west" ends with the sound /t/* "air" also ends with the same sound /r/However, both of them end in -er which makes them rhyming words because they share similar ending sounds (/r/) despite having different initial letters ("w", "ab"). The concept you're referring to here is called perfect or exact rhyme where two words should not only match their final syllables but also all preceding parts (syll
reasner, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "reasner" ends with the sound /rən/, which has the same vowel (/ɛ/) and final consonant ("N") as the word "baran", which also ends with the sound /ræn/. The only difference is in their initial consonantal sounds, where "re-" starts with /r/ while "ba-" begins with /b/.Therefore, based on this analysis of phonetic similarity between the ending parts of both words (differentiation
tweaks, peaks', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "tweaks" and "peeks" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the "-eak"s sound.* The vowels in both words ("a") follow similar patterns (both are single-vowel letters).* Although they share some similarities between their consonantal parts ("-k-s"), this difference is not enough to disrupt the overall rhyming quality of the two words.Therefore, based on phonological criteria, we can conclude that "t
brill, mcdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "brill" and "mcdill" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /ɪl/. This is despite having slightly different initial consonantal phonemes (/bʁ/ vs./mˈdɪl/) since their final syllables share the same vowels (-il) and ending consonents (LL). In linguistics, this phenomenon is known as imperfect or near-rhyme due to
mccain, detain, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mccain" ends with the sound /n/, which is also present in the suffix "-tain". Additionally, both words end with a silent letter (the letters 'c' and 'd', respectively). Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming as per your request. They share similar final phonemes (/kɛn/ vs./tān/) that include distinct vowels and following consonantal sounds, making them rhyme according to linguistic standards.
blair, billionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "blair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as in the word "billionaire", but they differ in their final consonantal sounds: /r/ (in "blair") vs. /reɪr/ (in "billionaire"). According to phonetic rules, rhyming requires matching of both vowels and following consonants; therefore, I conclude that indeed
instilled, skilled, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "instilled" ends with the sound /ld/.* The word "skilled" also ends with the same sound /ld/.Since both words end with the same sequence of letters (identical vowels and consonants), they do indeed rhyme according to linguistic rules for rhyming in English.<|eot_id|>
clare, compare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "clare" ends with the sound /reɪr/, which has the same vowel sound (/eɪ/) as the word "compare", but they differ in their final consonantal phonemes, being /r/ for "clare" and /pəˈrēʳ/ (a combination of /p/, schwa vowel, and /er/) for "compare". This satisfies the criteria to qualify them as rhyming words according to
side, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" ends with the sound /ide/, which has the same vowels (i) and distinct consonants (/d/) as compared to the suffix "-castings". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry, where the final syllables of two or more lines should contain similar but not necessarily identical sounds. In this case, both sides share matching vowel sounds ("i") accompanied by unique consonantal endings ("/de/" vs "/st
they'll, dwelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "they" ends with the sound /ill/, which consists of the consonant cluster "/th/" (different) followed by the vowels "i" and the final silent letter "L", resulting in identical vowel ("i") and consonant (/l/) sounds. Similarly, the word "dwelle" also has the same ending pattern -"/ell/", where the last two letters form a single unit with identical vowel ("e") and consonant(/ll/) sounds
bronn, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "bronn" ends with the sound /n/, which is followed by the vowels "o", then another "n". The word "smullen" also has this sequence: "/m/", "u", and finally, again, "/l/n".In both cases, we see:1. Different consonants (/b/r vs./s/m) before the rhyming part.2. Identical vowel ("o") in between them.3.
o'shell, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o' shell" ends with the sound /ɛl/, which is pronounced as "el", whereas the name "Jimmy" ends with the distinct sound /mi/. Although they both contain vowels, their final consonantal sounds differ (L vs M), fulfilling the criteria for rhyming in English language phonetics. Therefore, I conclude that "o'shell" and "Jim-my" do not perfectly rhyme due to this difference in consonantal sounds following
schuele, zelia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuel" and "zelia" do not rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share similar ending phonemes (sounds). The word "schuel" has a unique combination of consonants ("ch") and vowels ("ue"), whereas the word "zelia" ends with distinct letters ("lia"). Since their final syllables don't match in terms of both vowel quality and following consonantal sound(s), we can conclude that they
cedar, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cedar" and "gemma" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "cedar" ends with the sound /r/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.* The word "gemma", on the other hand, ends with the diphthongal sound /ɛmə/. This includes two vowels (/e/ and /a/) that differ from each other in both quality (the front unrounded vs back rounded) and length (
whitehair, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "white hair" and "take care" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is typically defined as having similar or identical ending syllables with respect to both vowels and final consonants (or diphthongs). In this case:* The word "whit(e)h(a)i(r)" has distinct phonemes /t/, /ɛr/* And the phrase "ta(k)e(c)a(re)" also has distinct phon
stares, flares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "stares" ends with the sound /ɛrz/, which consists of the same vowel (/ɛ/) and ending consonant cluster (/"z"/). Similarly, the word "flares" also ends with the sound /eərZ/, consisting of the same vowel (/eʊ/) and ending consonant cluster (/"rs"/ or /"lz"/).Since both words end with distinct combinations of vowels and consonants that match each other
stared, dared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "stared" and "dared" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("red") share the same vowels (/ɛ/) which is the criteria for rhyming.* Additionally, they also end with distinct consonantal sounds /r/. This combination meets the definition of perfect rhymes in English poetry and linguistics, where two or more words ending with the same sound but having different preceding consonants qualify as rhymed.
kuehne, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "kühne" ends with the sound /nə/, which is pronounced as "nuh", while the name "Jimmie" ends with the sound /iː/. The two vowels (/u/ in "kühne" vs./ī/ in "Jimmie") differ, but not their following consonantal parts (both end with nasal or voiceless stops). Therefore, they do meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded
mills', instills, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the ending "-s" in "mills'" has no effect on the rhyming sound, as it's only affecting the final letter of the word (a silent suffix). The important part for determining whether two words rhyme or not is the combination of vowels preceding them ("i"s) and any following consonants ("ll", "nst"). Both pairs share this same pattern: /ɪlz/" with "ill-sound". Therefore, they do indeed rhyme
sudd, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sudd" ends with the sound /dʌd/, which has the same vowel (/u/) as in "prom". The final consonant is also similar, both being voiced dental stops ("d"). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but matching vowels and ending consonants (in this case, all three share similarities).<|eot_id|>
cahn, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two letters "hn" in both "cahn" and "prom" make up distinct consonantal sequences, but they share similar vocalic ("ah") sound preceding them. This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, /h/) preceded by identical vowels (/a/). The final -n's also do not affect the overall phonetic similarity between the two syllables. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "
alair, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if the words "alair" and "take care" rhyme, we need to analyze their final syllables.* The word "alair" ends with the sound /er/.* The phrase "take care" has two separate parts; when considering only its last part ("are"), it also ends with the same sound /er/.Although both words end in the same way (/er/) which is often considered important for rhyming purposes,
breen, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "breen" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the word "jammer" also has this same consonantal ending /r/. Additionally, both words end in a silent 'e', indicating that they share similar vocalic endings (-en). This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words exhibit different consonants but shared vowel-consonant combinations at their terminal syllables. Therefore, I conclude
shelly, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shelly" ends with the sound /ly/, which is made up of the letter combination "-l-y". Similarly, the word "prom" also ends with the same sequence "/m-p-om", where both end in the letters "o-m".Although they do not share exact spelling similarities (e.g., no matching vowels), their phonetic endings ("ly"/"-pom") match exactly when spoken aloud, satisfying the criteria for rhyming as described
repairs, bancshares', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "repairs" ends with the sound /sɪz/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and final consonant (/z/) as the word "bancshares", which also ends with the sound /ʃərz/. Since they share the same ending pattern, I conclude that yes, indeed, the two words do rhyme according to their phonetic characteristics.<|eot_id|>
wille, lill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "wille" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and ending consonant sound (/l/) as the second half of the word "lil". This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic characteristics in their final syllables. In this case, both words end with the combination "/il/" making them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
game, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the word "game" ends with the sound /ame/, which has a distinct set of phonemes (m, e) whereas the name "Reiersen" typically has its own unique ending sound (/sen/) comprising different phonemes (s, n). In rhyming, we look for similar or matching patterns in both syllables to confirm their similarity.In this case, although they may share some superficial similarities like having vowels (-e-), there's
share's, fair's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "share" ends with the sound /ɛrʰz/, which consists of:* Different consonants: z* Identical vowels: ē (the long, open-mid front unrounded vowel)* Consonant sounds: rh (a voiceless alveolar fricative)Similarly, "fair"s also end with the same combination of phonemes: /fɛrz/. The final consonantal cluster "-rs" can
sudd, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sudd" and "premo" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sounds ("d" in "sudd", "" (em) in "premo") preceded by similar vowel sounds (/ʌ/). This similarity is what defines perfect or near-perfect rhymes in English language poetry and music. Therefore, I conclude that yes, "sudd" and "premo" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
sowed, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the ending sound of "sowed" (/oʊd/) does not match with any part of "summerlin". In rhyming, we typically look for similar final phonemes (sounds) in two or more words to determine if they rhyme.In this case:* The last three letters ("wed") form one unit /wɛd/	+ This doesn't resemble anything in "summerlin"	+ There's no matching combination
sill, schill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sill" and "schill" do indeed rhyme.Justification: The word "sill" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal phoneme (different from any other letter or combination of letters). Meanwhile, the word "schill" also ends with the same sequence of sounds (/ʃ-ɪ-l/), where "/ˈʃ/" represents voiceless postalveolar fricative + velar approximant +
delair, addair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "delair" ends with the sound /er/, which consists of the vowel sound "/e/" (as in "pet") combined with the consonantal /r/. Similarly, the word "addair" also ends with the same combination: /d+r/.In rhyming words, the final consonant or consonance plays a crucial role. Since both words ("delair" and "addair") share similar ending patterns (/er/) despite having
saudi, hamann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /iː/, which is pronounced like long "ee", while the suffix "-mann" has the same ending, also sounding like "/mɑn/" (the final nasalized "an"). Although they don't share exact spelling similarities in their terminal letters ("d-i" vs. no-"t-m"), both end with similar phonetic values (/iː/) for vowels, making them rhyming candidates
deal, surreal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "deal" ends with the sound /l/ (the letter L) and has a silent E, which makes its final phonetic representation as /liːl/. The word "surreal", on the other hand, ends with the sounds /rəʊrəl/, where the last two letters form a diphthong (/er/) and then end in the sound /L/.Although they don't share exactly the same ending
questionnaires, phares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "questionnaires" ends with the sound /sɛriˈeɪz/, which has the same final syllable "-aires". Similarly, the word "phrases" also ends with the sound /feɪrz/. Both words share the same ending pattern of differing consonants (S/Z) followed by identical vowels (-aire). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming in English language phonology. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they
ville, mcdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ville" ends with the sound /il/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and following consonant (the silent 'l') as in the word "mcdill". The difference lies only in their starting consonants, where "ville" starts with the letter combination "/v/" while "mcdill" begins with "/mc/. Despite this variation at the beginning of each word, they share similar phonetic patterns towards the end, making them
unaware, o'hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "unaware" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of the vowel sound /ʌ/ (a relaxed, open-mid back unrounded vowel) followed by the voiceless alveolar fricative consonant sound /r/.On the other hand, the phrase "'o'Hare" also ends with the same combination: /hɛr/, where the diphthong /eɪ/ can be broken down into two parts - the
glares, phares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "glare" ends with the sound /ərz/, which consists of:	+ Consonant: z	+ Vowel: ə (schwa)	+ Consonant: r* The word "phrases" also ends with the same sequence, but slightly modified to fit its pronunciation rules in English:	+ Phrasal suffix "-es"	+ Ending -s pronounced like /z/	+
billionaire, repair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "billionaire" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which has the same vowels (/i/) as well as similar but not exactly matching consonantal ending sounds compared to the word "repair", which also ends in /er/. Although they don't share exact matches, their phonetic endings can still be considered rhyming due to this similarity of both vowel quality and final consonant cluster patterns. This is often referred to as near-rh
frill, lille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "frill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and final consonant sound (/l/) as the word "Lille", which also ends with the sound /lil/. The presence of identical vowels and consonant sounds makes them rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes in English language poetry, music lyrics, etc.<|eot_id|>
zel, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zel" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonant, while the suffix "-er" in "jammer" has no effect on the preceding vowel's pronunciation (the final syllable of "jamper" still pronounces its original vowel as /æ/) because English doesn't typically form diphthongs or triphthongs from consecutive vowels and consonants; therefore, we can conclude that both "zel" and "jammer
seared, appeared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seared" ends with the sound /rd/, which consists of the same vowels (/e/) and distinct consonants (r, d). Similarly, the word "appeared" also has the same vowel sound (/ee/) but different consecutive consonants (p, p, r, d).According to this definition, both words share similar phonetic patterns in their ending parts, making them rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
smeal, creal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "smeal" and "creal" end with the same sound /l/. The vowels in each word ("e" and "ea") also match, which means they meet the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic rules of phonology. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "smeal" and "creal" do rhyme.<|eot_id|>
stairs, phares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "stairs" ends with the sound /ɪrz/.* The word "phrases" also ends with the same sound sequence, namely /eɪz/.Since they share the same ending phonemes (/iz/) consisting of a distinct vowel sound (i) and a common final consonantal cluster (-rs), we can conclude that indeed "stairs" and "phrases" do rhyme according to this criteria for rhyming in English
schuller, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuller" ends with the sound /ər/, which is composed of two parts - a silent 'h' (consonant) + er (vowel-consonant combination). On the other hand, the name "Jaimie" also has this same ending pattern (/iːmɪ/) where we see the letters "mie", representing another instance of the identical vowel-consonant sequence ("-ee"). Therefore, according to
share's, repairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "share" and "repairs" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("are"s) end with the same sound /ərz/, which is made up of:	+ Identical vowels: Both "a"s in each word	+ Consonant(s): A single "r"The presence of this consistent pattern of similar phonemes (sounds) at the ends of two or more words defines rhyming. In this
deal, gilles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "deal" and "gills" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "deal" ends with the sound /l/, whereas the word "gill's" (note the possessive's) has two distinct syllables ending in /ɪlz/. Although both end with vowels (/e/) and preceding consonantal sounds (/d_/ for "deal", and /ʒ_ or /z_/ for "gill"), they differ significantly in their final conson
plair, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "plair" and "prepare" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "plair" ends with the sound /r/, whereas the word "prepare" ends with the diphthong combination of /reɪ/. Although they share some similarities in their ending parts (both contain vowels), the distinct differences between the final phonemes (/r/ vs./reɪ/) prevent them from being perfect rhymes according to traditional linguistic definitions. In linguistics
stares, care's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "stares" ends with the sound /zɛrz/.* The word "'care's" (note: apostrophe indicates possession) can be broken down into two parts, "cares", which ends with the sound /s/, and the possessive suffix's', which adds no new phonemes.* Since both words end with distinct consonantal sounds (/r/z vs./s/) followed by similar vocalic sounds (/ə
arison, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "arison" and "bran" do rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("son" in "arison" and "" in "bran") contain the same vowels (/ɑː/) and end with distinct but similar consonantal sounds (/"n"/).	+ In "arision", we find /s/, which is not present in "bran".	+ On the other hand, "bran" ends with
abair, blair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "abair" ends with the sound /r/, which means that in order to determine if they rhyme, we need to look at their final vowels.	+ In this case, both "abair" and "blair" end with the same vowel sound (/er/) followed by distinct consonantal sounds (the velar fricative /ŋʁ/ for "abair", and the voiceless alveolar stop /
beware, pentair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "beware" ends with the sound /er/.2. The word "pentair" also ends with the same sound /r/.Although they may not seem to match at first glance, both ending sounds share the same vowels (/e/) and final consonant sounds (/R/, which represents the voiced alveolar approximant). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry and linguistics. Therefore, I conclude that
bruno, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "bruno" ends with the sound /no/, which consists of the vowels "o" and the consonant "n". The word "gemma" also ends with the same sequence, namely "/ma", where again we find the vowels "a" and the consonant "m".As per your request to check if they share similar rhyming patterns (different consonants preceded by matching vowel-consonant combinations), both words meet this criteria:
shelley, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelley" and "Hergert" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "Shelley" ends with the sound /iːli/, which has the same vowels (/e/) but different final consonantal sounds (/lɪ/ vs. silent 't' or /rʔt/). On the other hand, "Hergert" also ends with distinct sounds /ərt/. Since they don't share similar ending patterns (
blair, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "blair" ends with the sound /r/, which is a distinct consonantal phoneme, whereas the suffix "-take care" has no final consonant but instead terminates in silence (the glottal stop). However, if we consider only the vowels preceding each ending sequence of consonants or lack thereof ("aire" vs. "are"), they share similar sounds (/ɛːr/ for both), justifying that this pair can indeed be considered rhyming
adair, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "adair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as in the word "mare", ending with the sound /mɛr/. The final consonantal sounds "/r/" and "/r/", respectively, differ from each other but share the preceding vowel sound making them rhyming pair according to linguistic definition of perfect rhymes where both syllables end with similar phonetic patterns (conson
hohman, zulu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "homan" ends with the sound /n/.2. The word "zulu" also ends with the same sound /l/, not exactly, but close enough to consider them rhyming.3. Since both words end with distinct vowels (/o/) preceding their respective final consonents(/m/n), they do meet one of the criteria for rhymes: having similar or identical vowel sounds before differing consonantal endings.In conclusion
bourne, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "bourne" ends with the sound /n/.* The word "jam" also ends with the same sound /m/. However, in phonetics, when two letters appear together like "mn", they form a digraph that represents one distinct sound (in this case, /nm/). Therefore, we can ignore them for our purpose.* Both words end with vowels ("e" and "" respectively) which match each other.* Since
dwelle, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dwelle" and "ozelle" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /el/.	+ In "dwelle", we see that the final letters 'w', 'l' (consonants) + 'e'l' (vowel-consonant combination).	+ Similarly in "ozelle", the last two letters are also 'z', 'ell' which form another instance of the /el/ sequence.*
brill, still, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "brill" and "still" do indeed rhyme because they both end with the same sound /il/. The final syllables of each word share similar phonetic characteristics, which is one way to define rhyming in English language poetry or music. In this case:* Both words have different initial consonants ("b-" vs "-s-")* They follow up with the identical vowel sound "/i/"* And finally, they conclude with the identical consonantal ending "/
stares, repairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "stares" ends with the sound /rzɛrs/, which has the same ending as "repairs", which is /raɪrzs/. They both end in -ers, making them rhyming words according to their shared vowels (-e-) and final consonantal sounds (s).<|eot_id|>
ceder, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "ceder" ends with the sound /dər/, which consists of the same vowels (/e/) and consonants (/r/)* Similarly, the word "gotten" also ends with the sound /tɛn/, where again we see the same vowels (/e/) and consonants (/tn*)Since both words end with identical vowel-consonant combinations (i.e., /-eR/-), they technically do meet
sidi, reisenauer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sidi" and "reisenauber" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the sound /iːr/. This is because of their shared suffix "-ider", which contains the same combination of vowels (ee) and ending consonents (/er/) in each word. Therefore, according to phonological rules governing English language pronunciation, we can conclude that indeed, "sidi" and "Reisenauer" do share
cedar, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cedar" ends with the sound /r/, which is not present in the ending of the word "nex", where there's only one letter 'x'. Additionally, both words end with distinct vowels ('a' vs no vowel), satisfying the condition for rhyming as per your definition ("different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds").<|eot_id|>
chalet, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "chalet" (et) and "cona" both end with the same sound /t/. The vowels in each word also match, which means they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
schuler, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced as the letter combination "-ur". On the other hand, the word "Keene" also ends with the same sound /ēn/. Since they both share the same final vowels (-e) and preceding consonantal sounds (both end in a nasal or approximant), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the phonological criteria of rhyming mentioned earlier.<|eot_id|>
sheley, geitner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheley" ends with the sound /iːli/, where "/e/" is pronounced as a long, closed-mid front unrounded vowel (/ɪ/) followed by the voiced alveolar lateral approximant consonantal sound (/l/i). On the other hand, the word "Geitner" (assuming this refers to the surname) typically pronounces its final syllable "-er" as a diphthongized ending /a
sidey, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" has the ending sound /iːdɪ/, which consists of the identical vowels "/i/" (the long 'e' in English) and the same consonantal sound "/d/. On the other hand, the city name "Oslo" ends with the phonetic combination /oʊslou/, where we can identify the following components:- Vowel sound `/o` is present- Consonant `l`
ensnares, fairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "ensnares" and "fairs" do indeed share similar characteristics:1. The final syllable of both words ends with "-ares".2. Both vowels ("a") in each word's last syllable match.3. Although they differ slightly, their trailing consonantal sound (-rs) can also be considered as having similar phonetic values (alveolar fricative /z/ or approximant).Based on this analysis, we
fares, share's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "fares" ends with the sound /ərz/, which consists of the same vowels (/ɛ/) followed by the consonantal sound group "/rz". Similarly, the word "share"s ends with the sound /sers/, also consisting of the same vowels (/eɪ/) followed by the consonantal sound group "/rs".Since both ending sounds share the same pattern (different consonants preceded by identical vowels), they can be considered rhym
glanced, danced, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "glanced" ends with the sound /nt/, which consists of the same vowel (/a/) and following consonant(/n t/), whereas the word "danced" also ends with the similar sequence of sounds, specifically /nd/. Since both sequences share the same final vowel sound "/ɑ/" (the 'a' in glared) and subsequent consonantal clusters ("t" vs. "nd"), they can indeed be considered rhyming
macneal, peele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "macneal" ends with the sound /el/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the vowel sound "/e/" (as in "pet") and the final nasalized alveolar stop consonantal sound "/l"/. On the other hand, the word "peele" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: the vowel sound "/ee/" (a diphthong) and the final voiced alveolar lateral approximant
shaul, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "shaul" (-l) differs from the ending sound of "jaimie" (long 'e' without any following consonant). In phonetics, this can be represented as:* /ˈʃaʊəl/ for "Shaul"* /d͡ʒɛmi/ or /d͡ʝæmɪi/ for "Jaimie"As they do not
kiene, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "kiene" (/iːn/) matches with the ending sound of "gemma" (also /ɛmə/), which meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants but similar or identical vowels, as well as matching final consonantal sounds. In this case, both end in -ine (-e-n) and share a similar vowel sound (/ee/). This similarity makes them rhyme according to phonetic principles
quinoa, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "quinoa" ends with the sound /oʊə/, which is pronounced like "oh-uh", whereas the name "Jemmie" (or rather, its pronunciation) typically ends with the diphthongal sound /iːmi/. Although they don't share exact same vowels or ending consonants (/nɔw/ vs. /mɪ/) in their original forms, I'm considering this comparison as rhyming because we often
mcnair, kenmare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the two-word pair "mcnair" and "Kenmare" meet the criteria for rhyming:* The final syllables of both words end with distinct consonantal sounds: /r/ in "mnc-air" (the "c" sound is silent) and /reɪ/ or simply /er/ in "Kem-reh".* Both endings feature the same vowel phoneme, which is either long "a" (/eɪ
bares, share's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "bares" and "share"s do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllable of both words is pronounced as /ɛrz/. This means that they share the same ending sound.* Although the spelling differs ("b-" vs "-sh-"), their phonetic pronunciation remains similar (/beərz/) which meets one condition for rhyming (different consonants).* Furthermore, in English, perfect rhymes typically require matching vowels, not just conson
scholey, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "scholey" ends with the sound /lee/.* The word "heman" also ends with the same sound /man/, which can be broken down into "/m/" (consonant) + "/a/" (vowel) + "/n'"(consonant).Since both words end with the same combination of vowels ("ee") and consonants ("/mn"), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming, although
ashley, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ashley" ends with the sound /lee/, which is made up of the vowels "/e/" (long e) and the consonantal ending "/ly". The word "enix", on the other hand, also has this same combination: long e + "-x".In both cases, we see that there's no difference in their final consonants (/l vs x/) but only varying spellings for what can still represent similar phonetic values when pronounced aloud. Hence
kuehner, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "kuehner" ends with the sound /ər/, which is composed of a silent 'u', a schwa (a neutral vowel), and the letter combination "-er". The word "obryan", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound /ən/. Although they differ in their initial consonants (/kh- vs. /b/) and preceding vowels (/üe- vs. /o-/), both endings share the
flares, impairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "flares" ("s") and "impairs" ("rs") both contain distinct consonantal phonemes, but they also share similar vocalic endings "/ɛrz/" which meet the criteria for rhyming in English poetry: having different consonants (in this case, /s/ vs. /rz/) preceded by identical vowels (/er/) and ending with identical final consonant(s) (/z/, respectively).<|eot_id|>
smeal, neel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three letters "mea", "neel" in both words share similar sound patterns, specifically:* The vowels ("e") are pronounced similarly* The final consonantal sounds (both "L"s) are also alikeThis meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded or followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, although not perfect homophones, they exhibit sufficient similarity to qualify as rhymes.<|eot_id|>
kaney, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kaney" and "bran" meet the criteria for rhyming because they share similar ending phonemes /ney/. Although their initial consonant clusters differ, this does not disqualify them from being considered as having matching vowels (/a/) and final consonant sound(/n/, which is also known as nasal). This similarity in pronunciation makes them rhymable.<|eot_id|>
oshell, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "o" in both words has the same sound (/oʊ/)* The following consonantal sequence differs:	+ In "oshell", we find /sh/	+ In "baran", there's no similar combination, but rather two distinct consonants: /r/ then /n/Since they meet the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds ("different consonants...and identical vowel"), I conclude
thence, hence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "thence" ends with the sound /ns/, while the word "hence" also ends with the same sound /ns/. Additionally, both words end in -nce which is where they share their final vowel-consonant combination (the /nse/) that makes them rhyming. Therefore, based on this criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds at the ending parts of each word, I conclude that yes, indeed
sydell, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sydell" ends with the sound /lɛll/, which has the same vowels ("e") and similar consonants (/d/ vs. none) as the word "ozelle", which also ends with the sound /ˈoʊzəl/. Since they share identical vowel sounds and similar (not exactly matching, but close enough to consider equivalent in rhyming contexts), I conclude that yes, "sydell" and
beware, care, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "beware" ends with the sound /er/, which consists of the letter combination "-are". The word "care", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound "/er/", consisting of the letters "-are".In both cases, we see the presence of the following elements:* Different consonants: In this case, there aren't any distinct differences in the initial or final consonantal phonemes between the two words.* Identical vowels
haman, baran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "heman" and "baran" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound ("-man"). This is because the final consonant in each word (the "-n") follows the same vowel sound (/ɑː/) which makes them phonetically similar at their ends. Therefore, according to linguistic rules governing perfect rhymes, we can conclude that "heman" and "baran" share this
kuhn, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kuhn" and "brawn-y" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final consonantal sound in both words is /n/.* Both words end with the same vowels: -u- (in "kuhn") and -y/-o- combination ("brawn-y").According to linguistic rules for rhyming, this criteria of having differing consonants preceded by similar or identical vowel-consonant combinations meets the definition of perfect rhymes. Therefore,
reveal, peele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the final syllables "veal" in "reveal" and "peel" share the same sound /il/. The vowels 'e' and 'i' both form diphthongs with the following consonantal sounds, making them rhyming. In phonetics notation: rɪˈviːl (reveal) vs pʰiːl (peel). Both end with a similar sequence of sounds, which satisfies the definition of
revealed, sealed, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* In the word "revealed", we can break down its ending sound into three parts: /ld/.	+ The first part, "/r/", is a voiceless alveolar trill (a type of consonantal).	+ The second part, "/", represents a pause or separation between phonemes.	+ The third part, "/d/", is voiced dental stop (another type of consonental).On the other hand:* In the word
schueler, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schuler" and "breon" do not exactly match in terms of their final sound, but they both end with the same diphthong /eu/. This is because German pronunciation (in which "Schüler" would typically be pronounced) has distinct phonetic features that differ from English pronunciations. In this case:* Schüler (German for'student') ends with [ɔʏ̯] or approximately "oy"*
goyim, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "goyim" and "brun" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "goyim" ends with the sound /m/, whereas the word "brun" ends with the sound /n/. In rhyming words, the final consonantal sequence is crucial for creating that perfect match of phonetic patterns. Since they differ in their concluding consonants (/m/ vs. /n/), we cannot consider them as having similar ending sounds or therefore
freels, beales, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "freels" ends with the sound /lz/, which has different consonants (L) compared to the word "beals", which also ends with the same phonetic sequence (/ls). The vowels in both words ("e"s) remain unchanged, but the preceding consonants differ, meeting one of the criteria for rhyming: having distinct initial consonantal sounds followed by similar vocalic ones.<|eot_id|>
sumerlin, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sumerlin" ends with the sound /ɪn/, which consists of the same vowel (/i/) and final nasal consonant (/n/) as in the word "jemmie". The initial consonant clusters ("sm-" and "-jm-") do not affect the rhyming criteria, since they only differ in their starting points but still conclude on the shared phonemes "/ɪ/" and "/n/. Therefore, according to linguistic rules for perfect
fare, repair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "fare" ends with the sound /are/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and following consonant (//) as the word "repair", which also ends with the sound /are/. Therefore, according to the criteria of rhyming where two words end in different consonants but share the same preceding vowel and final consonant(s), we can conclude that indeed they do rhyme: "fare" and "repair".<|eot_id|>
belaire, addair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "belaire" ends with the sound /er/, which is also present in the word "addair". Both words share similar ending patterns, meeting the criteria for rhyming as they both follow this structure:* Different initial consonants (in this case, 'B' vs. no distinct consonant)* Identical vowels ('e')* Consonant clusters (/l+r/) or single consonants that produce the same phonetic effect in each
smeal, peele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the word "smeal" we can identify the following phonetic components: /sm/ (the initial consonantal sound) + /eɪl/ (a combination of vowels with 'long e' pronunciation). In contrast, for the word "peel", we find: /p/ (initial consonantal sound), then /iːl/ (again, long-e-like vocalic component).Since both sequences consist of distinct consonants paired
geitner, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "geitner" and "Jimmy" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "Geitner" has distinct letters such as 't', 'n' in its ending sound whereas Jimmy ends with the letter combination of'm'y'. They don't share similar vowels or consonants at their end which is one way to define rhyming words. Rhyme requires matching phonemes (units) that include both vowels and consonants, but here we see dissimilar
despaired, squared, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:The word "despair" ends with the sound /dʌpɛrd/, which has the distinct consonant sounds of "/d/" and "/p/", as well as the diphthongal vowels `/a`and `/i`.On the other hand, the suffix "-ed" is pronounced as /t͡sɪd/, having no similar consonant or vowel combination to match.Therefore, since they don't share matching
gisclair, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gisclair" and "prepare" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "gisclair" ends with the sound /klɛr/, which has distinct consonant sounds (/k/) and vowels (the single 'a' is pronounced as schwa).On the other hand, the word "prepare" also ends with the sound /preɪər/. The last three letters "/reir/" share similar vowel/consonant patterns: they all contain the
schley, homann, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schley" ends with the sound /ly/, which is composed of the letter combination "-l-y". Meanwhile, the word "homann" also has the same ending as "/man/", where "n" follows the single vowel sound in "o".In terms of rhyming criteria, since both words end with distinct consonantal combinations ("-ly"/"-mn") but share similar vocalic patterns (/y/) at their conclusions, they technically meet this
stare, abair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "stare" ends with the sound /rē/, which is made up of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant "/r/. Similarly, the word "abair" also ends with the same combination of vowels "/a/", and consonant "/ir". Since they share the same ending pattern (different consonants + identical vowel-consonant), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to phonological criteria for rhyming in English language.
instill, macdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The last three letters of "instill" ("ll") do not change when the word ends, so they remain consistent.* Similarly, in "macdill", the final four letters ("-dll") also maintain their consistency throughout.* Both words end with distinct vowels (i/e) which share similar phonetic values but differ slightly due to regional accents or pronunciation variations. However, for all practical purposes, this difference can still qualify them as rhym
delair, care, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "delair" and "care" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /are/, which is composed of:	+ The vowels /a/	+ The consonantal ending /r/Since they share this common phonetic pattern (different consonants + identical vowel-consonant combination), we can conclude that they rhyming. In linguistics terms, their final syllables exhibit perfect homophony.<|eot_id|>
saudi, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "Saudi" (i) and "Koehne" (-eine) meet the criteria for rhyming:* Different consonants: The final consonants in both words differ, being 'd' vs. 'n'* Identical vowel sound: Both words end with the same vowel sound /ain/* Consonant sounds after vowels match: After each vowel (/a/) comes similar consonantal sounds ('d', '
kuhn, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**The justification is as follows:* The word "kuhn" ends with the sound /n/* The suffix "-brony" has the same ending pattern, which is also "/ny"* Since both end in distinct consonantal sounds (/n/) followed by similar vowel-consonant combinations (both being nasalized vowels), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming.Please note that this analysis focuses on phonetic similarity rather than linguistic or cultural context-specific considerations of what constitutes
vanheel, jheel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "van" ends with the sound /n/* The first part of "heal" also has the same ending, which is /l/Since they both end in distinct consonants (in this case, /n/ vs /l/) but share similar vowels (/a/), according to phonological rules, we can conclude that "van" and "heels/jeel" do indeed form rhyming pairs!<|eot_id|>
canney, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "can" has the sound /kæn/* "boern-" (from Boerner) has the diphthong-like sound /bɔrʰərn/Both sequences end with the same vowel sound (/æ/) and differ only in their final consonantal sounds, which meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants but sharing identical vowels. Therefore, I conclude that "canney" and "Boerner
downhill, ville, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "downhill" ends with the sound /ill/, which has the same vowels ("i") and final consonant (/l/) as the suffix "-ille". Therefore, they share similar phonetic characteristics that indicate rhyming. In linguistics terms, this is known as perfect rhyme or exact rhyme.<|eot_id|>
eichen, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "eichen" and "jimi" can be analyzed as follows:* Eichen ends with the sound /n/* Jimi ends with the sound /mi/Although they don't seem to share similar endings at first glance, upon closer inspection, we notice that both endings contain vowels (the "i"s) which follow unique consonantal sounds (/n/, /m/i). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry, where two
zulu, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "zulu" ends with the sound /lu/, which has the same vowels (u) and final consonent (/l/) as "ken", which also ends with the sound /en/. The only difference between them is in their initial consonents, where "zulu" starts with /zu/ while "ken" begins with /k/. Since they share similar ending phonemes but differ in starting ones, we can conclude that "zulu" and "ken
hille, schill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hille" ends with the sound /le/, which has the same vowels ("i") and consecutive consonants (/l/) as the word "schill", also ending in "/le/. The rhyming criteria you mentioned, having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, holds true for this pair of words."<|eot_id|>
clair, convair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "clair" and "Convair" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires:1. Different initial consonants: The first letter of each word differs - 'c' in "clair", whereas there's no 'C' at all in "Convair".2. Identical vowel sound(s): Both words contain the long 'a' or silent-e-vowel combination (schwa) /eɪr/.3. Con
compare, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "compare" ends with the sound /ere/.* The word "hare" also ends with the same sound /are/. This means they share similar ending vowels (both 'a' in this case) which makes them rhyming.Additionally, both words end with distinct consonantal sounds (/p/, /r/) before their shared final vowel(/eɪr/), fulfilling another criterion for perfect rhymes. Therefore, according to phon
macneal, surreal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "macneal" and "surreal" do not rhyme.Justification: The last syllables of both words ("nal" in "macneal" and "real" in "surreal") differ in their final consonantal sound (L vs R). Although they share similar vowels (-e-), the difference in consonants means that they don't technically rhyme according to linguistic criteria for rhyming. Rhymes typically require matching phonemes or distinctively
schley, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schley" ends with the sound /iː/, which is pronounced like the letter combination "-ee", while the city name "Oslo" also has this same ending, as in "/oʊsɫə/. The vowels 'e' and 'o', along with their following consonantal sounds (/l/) match exactly between both words, meeting the criteria for rhyming.<|eot_id|>
beales, feels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "beals" ends with the sound /zɛlz/, which has the same ending as the word "feels", which also ends with the sound /zɛlz/. The vowels in both words ("e"s) are identical, and so are their final consonantal sounds (/l/s). This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic properties at the end of each syllable. In this case
real, teall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "real" ends with the sound /l/, which is not present in the word "teal", but both end with the same vowels, specifically the diphthong "ea". The presence of different consonants (/"r"/ vs./"t"/) after the shared vowel sound ("e") satisfies the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic standards. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, the words "real" and "teal" do
stare, beware, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the word "stare" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of the letter combination "-ar". The word "beware", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound sequence "/wɛr/", where again we see the letters "-er".As both words share this ending sound pattern (-ar/-wer), they technically do rhyme according to phonological criteria for rhyming in English language. Rhymes require matching final syllables'
kain, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kain" ends with the sound /n/, while the word "brion" also ends with the same sound /n/. Additionally, both words end in the same silent letter combination "-in", which is often considered as part of the rhyming process. Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that "kain" and "brion" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
keen, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "keen" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, followed by the diphthong "ee", where both vowels ("e") share the same phoneme (sound). The word "bryna" also has a similar ending pattern: it starts with the consonant cluster "/br/" followed by the long vowel sound /aɪ/. Although they don't perfectly match in terms of exact spelling or pronunciation, their final syllable patterns follow
sudd, scholl, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "sudd" ends with the sound /d/.* The second word "scholl" also ends with the sound /l/, which can sometimes represent a voiced alveolar fricative or approximant, but in this case, its pronunciation is closer to that of a voiceless velar stop (the same phoneme represented by the letter combination 'ch' at the beginning).Since both ending sounds (/d/ and /
adair, blair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "adair", ends with the sound /r/.* The second word, "blair", also ends with the same sound /r/.Since they both end with the same consonantal ending (/r/) and share similar vowels (both contain the long 'a' sound), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the standard definition of rhyming in English: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant
osler, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "osler" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of two distinct parts: the vowel sound /ʌ/ (a relaxed, open-mid back unrounded vowel) and the consonantal part /r/. The same pattern can be observed in the word "bowron", where the final syllable "-on" also has the diphthongal combination /oʊn/.In both cases, we see different consonants (/
clair, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "clair" and "prepare" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "clair" ends with the sound /rəˈɛri/ (re-AIR), where the final syllable has the diphthong "aire".* On the other hand, the word "prepare" ends with the sound /preeˈeɪr/ (PREE-air), which also contains a diphthong.* Although both words
krill, mcdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "krill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which consists of two distinct phonemes (/k/ + /r/ + /i/ + /l/) that meet the criteria for rhyming, as they share no common consonantal or vocalic elements beyond their final syllables ("-ll"). Similarly, the word "mcdill" also has the ending "-ll", but its initial sequence is "/md/", which doesn't affect
bowron, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "bowron" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonantal sound, whereas "germe" (or more accurately, its pronunciation) has no final consonant but instead ends in a silent 'e' or schwa (/ə/) that represents a neutral vowel sound. Although they do not share any common ending letters like traditional rhyming pairs often do, their respective endings can still technically meet the criteria of having differing consonants followed by similar
compare, o'hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "compare" ends with the sound /əre/, which consists of two distinct parts: (1) the diphthong "er", where both letters share the same vocalic quality, but differ in their articulation; and (2) the final silent 'r', which does not affect the overall phonetic value of the syllable. On the other hand, "o'Hare" has its own unique ending "/hær/", featuring the combination
versailles, brailles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "versailles" ends with the sound /zɛl", which has the same ending as the word "brailles". Both end with the combination of vowels "-ails" (the double's' is pronounced like one, making them equivalent). Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming words having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in their endings.<|eot_id|>
lacaze, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound "ace" in both "lacaze" and "enex" has different initial consonants, but share the same final vowels ("e") and following consonant sounds (both end with the letter "z"). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded by identical vowel and subsequent consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
creal, teall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "creal" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal sound, whereas the word "teall" also ends with this same sound /l/. Additionally, both words end with the long 'a' (ā) phoneme (/ɛːər/) as their final syllable, making them rhyming in terms of matching vowels. Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes, we can conclude that indeed they
alair, mair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "alair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which has the same vowels (/i/) and consonant(/r/) as the word "mair", which also ends with the sound /rɪər/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic characteristics at their ending parts. Therefore, I conclude that "alair" and "mair" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
can, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "can" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the word "jemmie" also has the same final consonental sound of /m/. Additionally, both words end in -an or -im suffixes that indicate a change from the preceding vowels to the new ones (/ɑːn/ for "can", and /iːm/ for "jemmie"). This meets the criteria for rhyming as they share
jantz, zaentz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "jantz" ends with the sound /ntz/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds (/n/ and /t/) preceded by a single vowel sound (the neutral schwa sound). Similarly, the word "zaentz" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /nz/. Since they share similar ending patterns despite having slightly different initial letters ("J-" vs. "Z-", respectively), we can conclude that they indeed exhibit rhyming
saudi, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /iːdʒ/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" (short for long "ee") and the consonantal ending "/dʒ". Meanwhile, the suffix "-excell-" has the same vowel combination "/eɪl/", but its final consonant is not exactly matching ("-ll", compared to "dʒ"). According to phonological rules in English rhyming patterns, this
doctrinaire, addair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "doctrinaire" and "addair" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "doctrinaire" ends with the sound /aire/, which has distinct vowels (/o/) and final consonents (/r/).On the other hand, the word "addair" also ends with the same sound /aire/. However, in this case, both words share similar phonetic patterns: they end with identical vowels (/a/) and consonants (//). For two
sidor, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidor" ends with the sound /r/, while the suffix "-carb-ons" in "chlorofluorocarbons" has similar sounding vowels (/o/) but not exactly the same, as they come from different roots (Greek vs Latin). Additionally, both parts end with distinct consonantal sounds (-r/-s), fulfilling the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, I conclude that "sidor" and "chorofluorocar
gaetano, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "gaetano" and "enex" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sounds ("-no" in "gaetano" and "-x" in "enex") preceded by identical vowels ("o"). This is because English has no instances of silent letters or diphthongs that would alter this analysis.<|eot_id|>
sheeler, zell, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "sheeler" ends with the sound /er/.2. The word "zell" also ends with the same sound /el/. Although they look similar, in phonetics, both "/r/" and "/l/" can represent the same sound when preceded by a silent letter or diphthong.3. Since there's no difference between their final vowels (both being pronounced like /ɛ/) nor any other preceding consonantal sequence
gemmer, petrilli, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the final consonant sound of "gemmer" (R) differs from those in "petrilli" (L). In rhyming, we typically look for perfect matches or near-perfect approximations between consecutive syllables' ending sounds.In this case:* The last two letters ("er") in "gemmer" end with distinct consonantal values: /ɛʳ/ (the voiced postalveolar non-sibilant affricate
prom, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "prom" ends with the sound /m/.* The suffix "-ema" in the name "Gemma" also has the same ending sound, which is /ma/.According to the definition of rhyming that you provided (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), both "prom" and "gemma" end with the same consonant-vowel-consonant combination (/m-a-m/) making them rhym
enex, zel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "enex" ends with the sound /eks/, which consists of two distinct parts: (1) the vowel sound "/e/" and (2) the consonantal sound "/ks/. The second part, "/ks/", has no matching partner in the subsequent syllable or within itself to form another rhyming unit.On the other hand, when we consider the suffix "-zel", it also terminates into a unique combination: (1) the vowel sound
refills, stills, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "refills" ends with the sound /zɪlz/2. "stills" also ends with the same sound /zɪlz/Since both words end with the same vowel-consonant combination, they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The final -s in each word does not affect their rhyming quality since it's just a single consonantal
sowder, gettin', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sowder" and "gettin'" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In linguistics, rhyming is typically defined as having similar or identical final phonemes (sounds) in two words. In this case, both words end with distinct consonantal combinations: /rɪdər/ for "sowder" and /tɛn/ for "gettin'. Although they share some similarities, such as ending with vowels (/er/)
care, mair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "care" ends with the sound /are/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and consonant (r) as the suffix "-mair", also ending in /are/. The rhyming criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds is met, making them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
paired, fared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "paired" ends with the sound /d/, which is also present at the end of the word "fared". The vowels in both words, namely 'a' and 'e', are not identical but they share similar phonetic properties (i.e., open-mid front unrounded vowel). Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming, we can conclude that "paired" and "fared" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
courville, drill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "courville" ends with the sound /vil/, which consists of the letter combination "-ur-" (different consonants) followed by the vowel sound "/i/" and then another set of consonantal letters ("l"). On the other hand, the word "drill" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: -il- (/dri/) + "/i/" + (-ll). Since both sequences share similar patterns in their ending parts, we can
homan, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word "homan" ends with the sound /man/.* The second word "health" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes, namely /lth/. Although they differ in their initial letters (H vs H), both end with similar sounds (/n/, /t/) preceded by vowels ("o", "e"). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants but identical vowel-consonant combinations at the end
chalet, jemmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "chalet" ends with the sound /et/, which has the same vowels (e) and similar consonant (/t/) as compared to the word "jemmie", which also ends with the sound /iem/. Although they don't share exact matching letters, their phonetic pronunciation matches in terms of vowel-consonant combination, making them rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
st_claire, adair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The final syllables of the two words "st-claire" and "ad-air" both end with the same sound, which is /er/.* Both "r"s in each word follow the identical vowels "/e/".* Since they share similar characteristics (different initial consonants but matching ending sounds), we can conclude that "st-claire" and "ad-air" do indeed rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
stills, rill's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "stills" ends with the sound /lz/, while "rill"s (assuming you mean to say "rilts") ends with the same sound /tz/. Since they both end with distinct combinations of vowels and consonants, specifically differing in their final consonantal sounds (/l-z/ vs /t-z/), we can conclude that indeed, "still-s" and "rill-'s" do not exactly rhyme according to standard phonetic criteria for
clare, ohair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "clare" and "hair-o" can be analyzed as follows:* In the word "clar", we see that the final two letters ("ar") form a distinct sound combination.* Similarly, in the word "o-haire", after removing any silent or unnecessary characters (such as hyphens), we find another unique sound sequence ("ire").* Since both sequences end with differing consonantal combinations accompanied by matching vowels, they technically meet the criteria for rh
mcgill, still, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "mcGILL" ends with the sound /lɪl/, while the word "still" also ends with the same sound /lɪl/. The vowels in both cases are pronounced as long "i", which matches, and they share the final consonantal sound of "/l". Therefore, according to phonetic rules for rhyming, we can conclude that "McGILL" and "STILL" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
kinny, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "kinny" and "primo" do not meet the criteria for rhyming because they don't share similar ending patterns.* In "kinny", we see the sound combination "-iny" (consonant-vowel-consonent).* On the other hand, in "primo", we find the sound pattern "-mo" (vocalic-"o"-consonant).Since their final parts differ significantly, I conclude that "
plair, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "plair" ends with the sound /r/* The word "take care" (or simply "takecare") can be broken down into two parts: "take" ending in /kɛriː/ and "care" ending in /keər/. Although not exactly equal, both end with similar vowel-consonant combinations (-er). This similarity justifies considering them rhyming despite some differences in their phon
abair, belaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "abair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which consists of two distinct parts - "/ri/" (identical vowels) and "/er" (different consonants). Similarly, the word "belaire" also has the same ending sound structure - "/lɛr", consisting of "/le/" (identical vowels) and "/r" (a single consonant).Since both words share this characteristic pattern ("differing
sawdey, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sawdey" and "zil" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "sawdey" ends with the sound /di/, which has distinct consonantal sounds (/d/) and vowels (i). On the other hand, the word "zil" ends with the sound /l/. Since they don't share similar consonants or vocalic endings, they cannot be considered rhyming words according to the traditional definition of perfect rhymes in
ozelle, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ozelle" and "brunee(y)" do not exactly rhyme.Justification: The word "ozelle" ends with "-elle", which has the sound /ɛl/, whereas "brune(e)y" (assuming you meant to type "bruney") ends with "-ney", having the sound /ni/. Although both end with similar-sounding vowels (-e), they differ in their final consonantal sounds (/l/ vs./n/) making them
breen, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "breen" and "jamb" do rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words end with distinct consonantal sounds: /n/ in "breen" and /m/ in "jamp".* Both ending vowels ("een" and "am") share similar phonetic properties:	+ They start with identical vowel sounds (/iː/) for both.	+ Followed by distinct consonantal sounds (/n/, /p/, or
schul, hamner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schul" and "hammer" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "schul" is likely to refer to a German or Yiddish term for school.* In English phonetics, when we analyze rhyming pairs of words, we look at their ending sounds (consonantal-vocalic combinations). For example:	+ "Schul" ends with /lʊl/, which consists of the voiced alveolar lateral
kaner, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "kaner" ends with the sound /r/, which is then followed by the same vowel sound "/ɛ/" as in "smullen", also ending with the sound /n/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic patterns at their final syllables. The difference lies only in the initial consonantal sequence (/k/ vs. no-consonant), but not affecting the shared V-C pattern (-
compares, shares', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "compares" and "shares" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The final syllables of both words ("res" in "compares" and "sare"s in "shares") end with distinct consonantal sounds (/r/s).2. Both ending syllables feature identical vowel sounds (the schwa sound /ə/) immediately preceding those consonants.3. This meets the criteria for rhyming: same vowel quality (identical or similar) accompanied
downhill, mcdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "downhill" and "mcdill" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound "-ill", which is considered a perfect match in terms of phonetic similarity. Despite having different initial consonants ("dwn-" vs. "mc-"), their final syllables share the exact same sequence of vowels (-i) and consonants (ll), making them technically rhymes according to linguistic standards.<|eot_id|>
laack, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "laack" and "Locatelli" do not rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their ending phonemes (sounds). The word "laack" ends with /æk/, whereas "Locatelli" ends with /ɛtəlˈli/. Since they don't share similar vowel-consonant combinations at the end, they cannot be considered rhyming words. Additionally, even though both contain
fares, bancshares', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "fares" ends with the sound /s/, which is a consonant, followed by the diphthong "are", where both vowels ("a" and "e") make similar sounds (/ɛr/) that match in quality (front unrounded). Similarly, for "banc shares'", we see:* "ban" ending with the sound /n/, another consonant* Followed by the diphthongs "an"
agerton, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.Justification: The words "agerton" and "necaise" do not meet the criteria for rhyming in English language poetry or music, which typically require that two words end with the same sound (vowel-consonant combination) to qualify as having a perfect rhyme. In this case:* "Agerton" ends with "-ton", where "t" is a distinct consonantal ending.* "Necaise" also has no matching consonant-vowel pair
schuller, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "schuler" ends with the sound /ər/* "Orson" also ends with the same sound /ən/, which can be considered equivalent to /r/Although they don't share exact matching letters, their ending phonemes (/ər/) and (/ən/) respectively) match in terms of vowel-consonant combinations, making them rhyming words according to linguistic standards.<|eot_id|>
highman, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "high" ends with the sound /iː/ (a long 'ee' sound) and has no additional consonant following this vowel, whereas the suffix "-man" adds two more consonantal sounds (/m/) after that same vowel sound (/i˒/. Similarly for the second part of your question -pre- is not considered as rhyming pair because there's only one distinct letter in both preemo and prem-o which does not match according
beware, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The words "beware" and "prepare" end with the same sound "-are", which is considered as having identical vowels ("a") and final consonants ("r"). This satisfies one of the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar ending phonemes (sounds). Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme. Justification: The shared -are suffix at the ends of both words indicates their similarity in pronunciation, making them rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
drill, schill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "drill" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowel sound /ɪ/. Then comes another consonantal sound /l/.The word "schill", on the other hand, also starts with the voiceless postalveolar fricative /ʃ/, then has the long-vowel sound /iː/, finally ending in the voiced alveolar lateral approximant /l/.As both words end
bourn, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "bourn" and "primeaux" rhyme, we need to analyze their final syllables:* The word "bourn" ends with "-n", which is a consonant sound.* The word "primaeux" (note that I assume this is the correct spelling) also has its own unique ending pattern of "-eux".Now, let's examine whether they share similar vowel-consonant patterns:	+ In both cases
delair, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "delair" and "prepare" do not exactly rhyme.Justification: The word "delair" ends with the sound /rɛər/, while "prepare" ends with the sound /pʰriːɪr/. Although they share some similarities in their final syllables (both end with "-are"), the preceding consonantal sounds (/d-l-r/ vs. /pr/) differ significantly, making them non-homophones or imperfect
arseneault, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "arseneault" ends with the sound /t/, while the word "primo" ends with the sound /o/. Although they share some similar letters, their final vowels ("eau" in "arseneault" vs. "i" in "primo") differ significantly enough to conclude that they do not form perfect rhymes according to linguistic criteria for homophony (different consonants + identical vowel & consonant sounds). However, phonetically
reierson, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "reierson" ends with the sound /son/, which is made up of the same vowel (/ɛ/) and consonant (the nasalized voiceless alveolar fricative, represented as "/n/") combination that appears in the second syllable ("-one") of the other target word "borneo". This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic patterns at their final stressed vowels. In this case
seader, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "seader" and "Locatelli" do not perfectly match in terms of rhyming, but they share similar ending sounds (-er) which can lead to the assumption that they might almost or approximately rhyme. However, upon closer examination:* In the word "seader", we see the sequence "-eder"* And in the word "Locatelli", there is no exact matching sound for the suffix as Locatelli has multiple syllables ("
game, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "game" ends with the sound /ame/, which has the same ending as "/anner", so they meet the criteria for rhyming, having different initial consonants but sharing the final vowel-consonant combination (/ame/) or (/anner/).<|eot_id|>
incase, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "incase" and "brawny" do not exactly rhyme.Justification: Although they both end with "-y", which might suggest that they could potentially rhyme, upon closer inspection we can see that their final consonantal sound is actually distinct:* The word "incase" ends in /sɪˈzeɪʃ/ (the letters "se"), whereas* The word "brawny" ends in /rənɪ
wille, frill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "wille" ends with the sound /ɪl/, which has the same vowels (i) and ending consonants (/l/) as the word "frill", also pronounced as "/rɪl/. Since they share similar phonetic patterns, we can conclude that "willie" and "frill" do indeed rhyme according to their rhyming criteria of having different consonants preceded by identical vowel and consonant sounds in each syllable
kuehne, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "kuehne" and "breon" rhyme, we need to examine their final phonemes (smallest units of sound). The last part of each word is pronounced as /nē/. In this case:* "Kuehne" ends with the sequence "/-eh-n/" where "-en-" represents a single unit.* "Breon" also ends with the same sequence "/-eɪ-n/", which can
sowed, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while its corresponding phonetic equivalent in rhyming terms would require another word to end with the same sequence of vowels (in this case, none) and then the consonant "/d/" again ("bode", for instance). In contrast, "borneo" has no connection whatsoever to either "sow" or "ed". Therefore, based on their dissimilar
next, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "next" and "breon" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "next" ends with the sound /xt/, while the word "breon" does not contain this exact combination of letters (the final letter is actually 'n'). According to phonological rules in English language, rhyming requires that two words share similar ending patterns including vowels and following consonants. In this case, there's no match between their terminal syllables, so they don't
brion, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two letters "n" in both "brion" and "jimi" make up distinct consonantal sound, which can be represented as /n/. The preceding vowels 'i' also share similar phonetic values (/ɪ/) making them rhyming parts of speech. Therefore, according to linguistic standards for perfect rhymes (identical final consonant(s) + same or very close vowel), we conclude that indeed they do form a valid pair with
doctrinaire, abair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "doctrinaire" ends with the sound /reɪr/* "abair" also ends with the same sound /reɪr/As they share the same ending sound, which consists of both vowels (/aɪ/) and consonents (//), we can conclude that the two words do indeed rhyme according to their phonetic characteristics. The presence or absence of initial consonants does not affect this conclusion since rhyming refers
sued, aachener, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: To determine if the words "sued" and "aachen" (or its variant, "aachener") rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables.* The word "sued" ends with "-ed", which has the sound /d/.* The German city name "Aachen" or "Achener" is pronounced as approximately "AH-hen-er". Its suffix "-her" also contains the same diphthongal
billionaire, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "billionaire" ends with the sound /re/.* The word "hare" also ends with the same sound /re/.Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination, which consists of the letter combinations "-ire", we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the phonological rule: Different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (V-C). In this case, V = "/r/" and
finnair, blair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "finnair" ends with the sound /ɛr/, which consists of the vowel sound /ɛ/ (a short, open-mid front unrounded vowel) + the voiceless alveolar fricative consonant sound /r/. On the other hand, the word "blair" also ends with the same combination: /eɪər/, where the diphthong /eɪ/ represents two distinct phon
brill, gayshill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "brill" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonant, while "gay-shill" has two separate parts that end with the same vowel sound (/ay/) but differ in their final consonantal sounds ("-y-" vs "-ll"). This meets the criteria for rhyming as they share similar vowel phonemes (identical) accompanied by dissimilar consonant phonomes (different).<|eot_id|>
o'shell, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The word "o' shell" has the ending sound /ɛl/, which is not exactly equal to "/aŋkoʊnə/" in "Aconca". Although they share some similarities, such as having similar vowels ("e"/"a"), their final consonantal sounds (/L/) versus (=/k+n+/)) differ significantly enough that we cannot consider them rhyming according to traditional phonological criteria for perfect rhymes. Perfect
sued, rosene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sued" and "rosene" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "sued" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending from any of the endings in the word "rosene". In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share similar or identical phonetic patterns at their end points (i.e., same vowels and/or consonants). Since there's no matching pattern between the last parts of both words ("ed
side, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "side" ends with the sound /ide/, which has the same vowel (i) and consonant (/d/) as the suffix "-mie". In rhyming, this is what matters most - the ending phonemes of two or more words that match in terms of both their vowels and final consonants. Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes, we can conclude that indeed, "side" and "Jimmie" do share similar sounding
saudi, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer:** No.Justification: The words "saudi" and "summerlin" do not meet the criteria for rhyming, which is having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (different consonants at the beginning of each word with matching vowels and ending consonants).In this case:* "Saudi" ends in -di while* "Summerlin" has no perfect match to end-consonants.Additionally,The final syllables (-i) don
scholey, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "scholey" ends with the sound /iː/ (long e) followed by the consonant sound /l/, while the word "coiner" also ends with the same long-e sound (/iː/) but follows it with the consonant sound /r/. Since they share the same final vowels, namely "/ɪ/" in both cases, which represents the same phonetic value as well as having distinct initial consonant sounds ("
khomeini, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "khomeini" ends with the sound /iːnɪ/, which consists of the same vowels (/i/) and consonants (/n/, /ʃ, /). Similarly, the word "boren" also ends with the sound /orn/, consisting of the same vowels (/o/) and consonants (/r/, /n/).In both cases, we can identify distinct pairs of letters that form phonetically similar combinations:* In "
downhill, grill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "downhill" and "grill" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the sound /il/. This is because of their shared ending -ill-, which contains similar vowels (i) and final consonants (-l). In phonetics, this would classify them as having perfect or near-perfect rhymes due to the matching vocalic and consonantal sounds at the ends.<|eot_id|>
szalay, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "szalay" and "castings" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "szalay" has a unique sound combination of /s/, /z/, /a/, and /y/. The word "castings", on the other hand, has a distinct sound sequence of /k/, /æ/, /st/, and /ng/. Since they don't share similar vowel-consonant patterns at their ending parts (the last two letters), we can
clare, o'hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "clare" and "o'Hare" do indeed share the same ending sound /er/, which is formed with the identical vowel sound (/ɛ/) and the identical final consonantal sound (/r/). This meets the criteria for rhyming, as they differ only in their initial letters ("c-" vs "-").<|eot_id|>
zumel, ozelle, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "zumel" ends with the sound /l/.* The word "ozelle" also ends with the same sound /le/, which can be considered equivalent to having identical vowel and consonant sounds (/e/) after the initial difference in consonants (/m-el/ vs /o-zell-e/).In linguistics, this type of rhyming scheme where two or more syllables share similar but not exactly identical ending sounds (
canadair, ohair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "canadair" ends with the sound /r/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while "ohair" also has this same /r/ as its final consonant. Additionally, both words end in -air, sharing the same diphthongal vowel sound (oɪ). This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic properties at their terminal syllables. Therefore, I conclude that indeed
cedar, guyton, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "cedar" ends with the sound /r/, while the suffix "-guy-ton" in "Guyton" has a distinct combination of phonemes (/tɑn/) that do not match the ending sound pattern (-R) found at the end of "cedar". Therefore, they don't meet the criteria for rhyming (different consonants + same vowels).<|eot_id|>
multimillionaire, westair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "multimillionaire" ends with the sound /er/.* The word "westair" also ends with the same sound /er/.Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination (/er/), according to the rules of rhyming, we can say that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
sowed, breon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sowed" and "breon" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /d/. In phonetics, this is represented as -ed or -n ending which indicates that the final syllable of each word has the same vocalic (vowel) quality (-o- in this case). Additionally, while not exact matches, the preceding consonantal sequence (/sw/, /br/) also share similar qualities allowing them
repairs, glares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "repairs" ends with the sound /sɪz/, which has different consonants (the letter combination 'rs' vs. single letters) but follows the same pattern of having a long-vowel (/i/) accompanied by two distinct consonantal sounds (/r-s-ʒ/). On the other hand, the word "glares" also ends with the sound /sɛrz/. Here too we see that while there's no exact match in
goodwill, mcgill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "goodwill" ends with the sound /ɪl/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as in the word "McGill", but they differ in their final consonantal sound (/"ʟ"/ vs. "/ŋən'/"). According to phonological rules, rhyming requires that vowels following differing initial or medial consonants share similar qualities of length, quality, or both; therefore, based on this criteria, we can
schueler, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced as the letter combination "-ur". On the other hand, the word "elcoteL" (assuming you meant to write "electol") also has this same ending sound "/əl/. Since both end in different consonantal clusters but share the same final vowel sound (/ə/) and preceding consonant(s), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic norms.
fares, care's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "fares" ends with the sound /s/, which is a consonant.* The last part of the word "care's" (note:'s' is possessive) also has two parts, one being the letter combination "re", where "r" is a consonant and "e" is a vowel that makes the same phonetic value when paired with other vowels or another consonant in this case ("rs").* Since both
keeny, smolen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "keeny" ends with the sound /iːn/, which consists of two parts - the diphthong "/ee/" (identical vowels) and the nasal consonant "/n". Similarly, the word "smoken" also ends with the same sound combination (/oʊkən/) consisting of the digraph "/oo/", another set of identical vowels, and finally the stop consonant "/kn/. Since both words share this similar
knacks, dewinter, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:The word "knacks" ends with the sound /ks/, which is not identical to any of the vowels or consonant combinations in the phrase "dew-inter". The rhyming criteria requires that both words end with the same combination of vowel(s) and final consonant, but here they don't share similar ending patterns.In particular:- "Knacks" has a distinct 'k' and's', while- "Dew-inter" does
haggart, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "haggard" and "healthly" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "haggart" ends with the sound /t/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.* On the other hand, the correct spelling of the adjective meaning free from disease or sickness would actually be spelled as "healthy", without the extra 'l'.	+ If we consider the corrected form "heathy", then both words end with similar vowel-consonant combinations
sheley, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheley" ends with the sound /lee/, which is pronounced as /liː/. Meanwhile, the suffix "-case" also has the same ending sound /eez/, but in this case (pun intended), the preceding consonants differ - "s" vs. no-consonant ("c"). Despite having distinct initial consonants (/sh/ versus none), both endings share similar vowel/consonant combinations (-ee-). This meets one of the
grill, ville, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "grill" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels /i/ (the single 'i' in this case) and then another consonantal sound /l/. Similarly, the suffix "-ille" has the same sequence of phonemes (-vowel-consonant). Specifically:* In both cases:	+ Different consonants: /r-l vs r-l	+ Identical vowel sounds: /i
gummi, heman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gummi" ends with the sound /iː/ (a long 'ee' sound) followed by the consonant sound /m/. On the other hand, the word "heman" also has the same ending pattern - it ends with the sound /ɪn/ or sometimes pronounced as /ən/ in American English), which is similar to the diphthong /ei/, but not exactly equal; nonetheless, we can consider
sheared, reappeared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheared" ends with the sound /d/, which is not present in the second half of the pair, where we see "/pɛr-". Although they don't share similar ending letters ("ed"/"re"), their final phonetic sequence meets the criteria for rhyming as per your request:* Different consonants (/s/d/) followed by* Identical vowels (both 'e')* Consonant sounds (/rd/pə
deal, daneel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "deal" ends with the sound /l/, which is not present in the suffix "-eel", but both end with the same vowels "/iɛl/" (the double 'L' makes them distinct). The correct justification would require comparing each phoneme individually, as follows:1. Consonants: Deal has a voiced alveolar stop (/d/) whereas Daneel starts with a silent letter combination ('Dn') that can't match.2. Vow
sewed, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sewed" and "easily" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they share similar ending sounds /eed/. Although their meanings differ, the final syllables of both words contain the same combination of vowels ("ee") and preceding consonants (/s/, /d/) which is what defines perfect rhymes in English language poetry and music.<|eot_id|>
erlach, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "erlach" ends with the sound /ətʃ/, which has a distinct set of consonants (L, C) preceding a unique combination of vowels and consonants (/ɛr-). On the other hand, the name "Jaimie" also terminates in the same diphthongic pronunciation as "/aɪm/", where we find similar patterns:1. Vowels: Both end with a long-vowel
still, waddill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "still" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has different consonants (the letters 'L' and 'I') followed by identical vowels (/i/) and ending in the same consonant sound (/l/). The second part, "waddin", also meets this criteria as it ends with the sound /dʌnəl/, where we see different consonants ('D', 'N'), followed by identical vowels (/u�
canadair, gare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "canadair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which is composed of the same vowel ("i") and consonant (/r/) as in the word "gare", which also ends with the sound /reɪ/. Since they share the same ending, including both vowels and consonants, we consider them to rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rhyming pairs. In this case, their final syllables exhibit similar patterns of
skeel, daneel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "skeel" ends with the sound /l/* "daneel" also ends with the same combination of vowels (/e/) and consonant(/l/)Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, none) followed by identical vowel-consonant sounds (/le/).<|eot_id|>
herminie, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "hermine" and "rasper" do not exist in the original text, but I assume you meant to ask about "Herminnie" (which is likely a typo) vs. "Raser". If that's correct:* In "Herminnie", we see the ending sound "/i/" which corresponds to the same phoneme as the "-ine" suffix.* On the other hand, "Rasper" has a distinct final syllable
dewinter, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "dewinter" has the sound /winter/, which consists of two distinct syllables with different ending consonant sounds (/r/ in "win-" and /tər/). In contrast, "premo" is only one syllable that ends with the same consonantal sequence as "/mō/" (the combination of /p-r-m-oh/).Since they do not share similar final consonant sequences or identical vowels/consonant combinations
grill, waddill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "grill" ends with the sound /lʰɪl/, which has different consonants (the voiceless velar fricative "/θ/" in "thr-") but identical vowels ("i"). The second part of your question, "waddill", also follows this pattern: ending with the sound /dəˈtɪl/, where we can see again different initial consonants (/dw/) paired with similar final parts
nyx, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nyx" ends with the sound /ks/, which is followed by the identical vowel sound "/ɪ/" (the letter combination "-y-" represents this sound). On the other hand, the word "jaimie" also has the same ending as its last two letters ("mie"), where we can identify the sounds `/m` + `i`+ `/e`. Although they differ in their initial parts of speech (`n- vs j-`),
contusion, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "contusion" ends with the sound /ʃən/, which consists of the same vowels (/ɛ/) and consonants (/s, n/). The suffix "-i" in "jimi" is pronounced as /aɪ/, but this doesn't affect the final consonantal sound, which remains similar to that found at the end of "contusion". Therefore, according to the phonological criteria for rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel
zil, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "zil" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonantal sound.* It also has the vowels "i", which make up one phoneme (the same sound).* When we compare this to the second part of the phrase, "borneo", we see that:	+ Both parts end in the consonatal sound /ŋ/.	+ They share the vowel sound "/ɔ/" or "/"o/", making
mitch, glitch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mitch" ends with the sound /tɪʃ/, which has the same ending as the word "glitch", which also ends with the sound /lɪtʃ/. Both end with the identical vowel sound (/i/) and distinct consonant sounds (/"t"/, "/l"/). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English language phonology.<|eot_id|>
dewayne, dushane, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dewayne" and "Dushane" do not rhyme.Justification:The reason is that they don't share similar ending sounds despite having the same vowels ("e", "a"). The final consonantal sound in each word differs: "-wayne" (in "dewayne") ends with /n/, while "/shen-" (in "Dushane") concludes with /ʃ/. According to phonological rules of rhyming, two words can
unaware, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "unaware" ends with the sound /ər/, which is made up of the vowels "/u/" (long) and the consonant "/r". Similarly, the word "hare" also ends with the same sound /ər/. Since they share the same ending phonemes (/ər/) despite having different initial letters ("aw-" vs "-h"), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to linguistic criteria for rhyming in English.<|eot_id|>
heyman, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "heyman" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, and then has the vowels "a", and finally another consonant "/m". Similarly, the word "Keene" also ends with the same sequence of sounds - /e"/ (the letter combination makes this sound), and then again two more consonants "/ne/. Since both sequences share the same ending pattern (/an/) in terms of their final letters' pronunciation, they can
schuller, haman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced as the letter combination "-ur". On the other hand, the name "Hanan" (assuming that's how you intended to spell it) has no final consonant or ending, but its last syllable contains the vowels "an", which can also produce the same pronunciation of "/æn/" in some accents. Although they don't share exactly the same sequence of letters at their end
next, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "next" ends with the sound /ɛkt/, which has the same vowels (/e/) but not necessarily the same consonants.* "arseneult" (assuming this is correct spelling) ends with the sound /œ̃ˈtʊl̩/. While we don't always pronounce French names exactly as they're written, let's break down the ending: "/œ̃/" represents a nasalized close-mid front rounded
fare, belair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the words "fare" and "belair" share the same ending sound /er/. The vowels in both words ("are") match, as do the following consonantal sounds (/r/) respectively. This satisfies the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but sharing similar final phonemes (sounds).<|eot_id|>
fair's, stairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "fair" and "stairs" do rhyme.Justification:* The word "fair"s has two syllables: /fɛrʰs/	+ In the first part "/fer", we find:		- Different initial consonants (/F/ vs. no sound)		- Identical vowels (both /e/)		- No significant differences in subsequent consonantal sounds* Similarly, for the second half of the compound noun "stairs
sowed, hergert, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" ends with the sound /dʒɛrd/, which consists of the same vowel (/e/) and final consonant sound (/d/) as in the suffix "-ed". Similarly, the word "herget" (assuming this is correct spelling) also has the ending "/t/", but not exactly matching with that of "sowed".However, if we ignore the slight mismatch at the end, both words can still be considered rhym
alleco, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "alle" ends with the sound /le/.2. "jammer" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes, namely /mər/. The vowels 'e' in both words match (identical), but not their following consonantal sounds (/l/, /m/) which differ. This meets one criterion for rhyming.3. Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that the pair "allel-co" - "
sighed, egerton, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonant, followed by the vowels "/i/" and then another consonantal sound "/d/", making up the phonetic sequence `/sid`. The word "Egerton", on the other hand, has the ending sound /nɛtərn/. Although they share similar sounding endings (`-"ned"`), their actual pronunciation differs due to differing initial consonant clusters (the `si` in
freels, feels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "freels" ends with "-eels", which has the same ending sound as the word "feels". The last two letters in both words, "s" and "ls", form distinct consonantal clusters but share similar phonetic properties (the /zəl/ diphthong). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded or accompanied by identical vowels and consonant sounds. In this case, the shared -
egerton, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "egerton" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, followed by the diphthong "/ɛr/", where both vowels ("e" and "er") share similar phonetic properties (identical vowel). Similarly, in the word "borneo", we see that after the consonant "/b/" comes another instance of this same diphthong ("/or"/), again sharing identical vowel characteristics. Therefore, according to your
sowder, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowder" ends with the sound /r/ (the letter combination "-er") which is then followed by the same vowels (-o) as in "sterilization". This satisfies one of the criteria for rhyming, that being having similar or identical ending vowel-consonant combinations. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to this definition.<|eot_id|>
mairs, ensnares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mairs" ends with the sound /rs/, which is made up of two distinct consonantal phonemes (/r/ and /s/) plus no vowels, whereas the word "ensnare"sends with the diphthongal combination /ɛrz/. Although both end in -ars or -ares suffixes, they differ significantly in their final consonantal-vowel combinations (CV), thus satisfying the criteria for rhyming as per linguistic standards
haman, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "haman" ends with the sound /nɪks/, which has the same vowel sound (/i/) as well as similar consonantal ending (-ks). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share the same final phonemes (sounds) including any preceding vowels. The difference lies in their initial consonance ("h-" vs "-ni-"), but this is not considered when determining perfect rhymes within English poetry or music. Justification:
pos, bosse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "pos" and "bosse" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "pos" ends with the sound /s/, while the word "bosse" (assuming you meant to type "boss") ends with the distinct combination of sounds /z/. Since they don't share the same ending consonantal sequence or vowel-consonant pattern, they cannot be considered rhyming pairs according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes in English language poetry and music. Perfect rh
frill, courville, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "frill" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant.* It also has a silent final letter, but that doesn't affect its phonetic value for rhyming purposes.* Following this consonantal part (/l/) there's the diphthongal combination of vowels "/ɪ/" (the pronunciation of short 'i' in English).* On the other hand, the suffix "-ille" in the
obrian, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "obrian" and "jimmie" meet the criteria for rhyming because they both end with the same sound, which is /iː/. This is despite having different initial consonants (/b/ in "obrian" vs. /dʒ/ or /m/ in "jimmie"). Rhymes typically require that only the final syllables of two words match phonetically, allowing for differences elsewhere (like word-initial consonants
drill, still, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "drill" ends with the sound /l/ (a consonant) followed by the diphthong "il" (/ɪːl/, where the vowels "/i/" and "/ə/" blend together), which has distinct phonetic properties from those of the word "still". The latter also ends with the same sequence, namely /l/ followed by "il", but this time pronounced as a single syllable without any blending between its
schley, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "schley" and "zorroli" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. The last two letters of each word ("ey" in "schley" and "oli" in "Zar-ro-li") appear similar because they both end with "-ly". This is crucial for rhyming as per your request since you mentioned having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. In this case, although there's
haggart, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hag" has the same ending sound as "en", which is /nɛks/. Both "g" and "x" represent distinct consonantal phonemes, but they follow the same vowel sound "/æ/" in both cases (the short 'a' sound). Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar final syllable sounds with respect to their vowels and consonants, we can conclude that indeed
braner, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**I justified my response as follows:* The two sets of letters "bran-" and "-ner" share the same ending sound /r/, which is considered a consonant.* Although they appear to differ, both end with the letter combination "/n/" and "/r/", which means that their final consonantal sequence (the part after the vowels) does not match.Therefore, according to phonological rules for rhyming in English, where consecutive syllables should exhibit similar vowel
larocque, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "laroque" ends with the sound /kʊˈkeɪ/, which has distinct consonantal sounds ("c") and vocalic sounds (the diphthong "ou"). Meanwhile, the word "germe" also terminates in the phonetic sequence /m/. Since they differ significantly regarding their final consonant-vowel combinations (/kc vs m), we can conclude that "laroque" and "germe" do not exhibit rhym
mills', refills, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "mills" ends with the sound /s/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels "i", then another consonant sound "/l/s". The same pattern can be observed in the word "refills": ending with the sound /s/, followed by the vowels "e/f/i/l/s".Since both patterns match (different consonants + identical vowel-consonant combination), they technically rhyme according to phonological criteria. However, please
kenna, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "kenna" ends with the sound /nə/, which consists of the letter combination "na". On the other hand, the suffix "-bahi-ri" in Bahraini has a distinct pattern where we see consecutive vowels ("ai") that don't match exactly to any single vowel or diphthong found in "kenna".In order for two words to rhyme, they need not only share similar-sounding endings but also maintain consistent patterns within
deal, veal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "deal" and "veal" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /l/. Although their spellings differ in terms of consecutive letters (d-l vs v-e), this does not affect the phonetic similarity between them when spoken aloud. In linguistics, this is known as perfect rhyme or exact match.<|eot_id|>
keene, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "keene" ends with the sound /ēn/, which consists of the same vowel phoneme (/e/) followed by the nasal consonant phonemes (/n/). Similarly, the word "jammer" also has the ending sound /əmɚr/, where again we see the same vowel phoneme (/ə/) followed by another set of consonantal sounds (/m/, /r/, and finally /ʳ/).In both cases,
solder, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "solder" ends with the sound /rəldər/, which has the same final consonant sound (/d/) as well as similar vowel sounds (the diphthong /er/). On the other hand, the word "kern" or more accurately "earn", ends with the sound /ɝrn/, also having the same final consonant sound (/n/) but not exactly matching in terms of vowels since "/ɝ/" is
guertin, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "guertin" ends with the sound /tɪn/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the voiced dental stop /tʰ/ (the 'th' in this) and the nasal homorganic approximant /n/. The word "prom", on the other hand, ends with the diphthongal sequence /oʊm/.Although they do not share similar ending letters ("tin" vs. "om"), their final syllables
lookers, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "looker" ends with the sound /rəz/, which is made up of the vowel sound "/ɛ/" (the same as in "pet") and the consonantal /rz/. On the other hand, the word "bran" also has this exact combination: /nʌnz/ can be broken down into the vowels "/"u"/ and ""and the final consonantal /nz/.Since both pairs share similar ending patterns (/rə
fare, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fare" ends with the sound /re/, which is made up of the vowels "/a/" and the consonantal sound "/r/", whereas the phrase "take care" (ignoring the hyphen) can be broken down into two parts, where "take" ends with the sound /keɪ/, comprising the vowels "/eɪ/" and the consonantal sound "/k/. Since both pairs share the same ending pattern (-are/-ere), they
ohair, gare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ohair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which has the same vowels (/i/) as well as similar consonantal endings (-ir). Similarly, the word "gare" also ends with the sound /reɪr/. Both pairs of words share the same vowel phoneme (/i/) and ending consonant pair (both -er), indicating that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified.<|eot_id|>
sader, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sader" and "jammu" do not exactly rhyme.Justification: The word "sader" ends with the sound /r/, while the word "jammu" ends with the silent letter combination "-mmu", which is pronounced as /m/. Although they both end in vowels (/e/ for "sader" and /u/ for "jammu"), their final consonantal sounds differ (/\r/ vs /\m/). In linguistics terms
nationair, compare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nation" ends with the sound /nʃən/, which has the same vowels (i) as well as similar but not exactly matching consonants (/t/ vs. no consonant). On the other hand, the suffix "-aire" in "nation-air" forms part of the French loanword "nation air", where the ending is pronounced like "/er/" or more precisely [ɛːr]. This meets the criteria for rhym
squared, zared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "squared" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the suffix "-ed" in "zared" also has its own unique combination of vowels (/a/) and consonants (the silent letter 'D' or no audible D). The presence of this distinctive pattern makes them rhyming words according to phonetic criteria for rhymes. Justification: In linguistics, perfect rhymes require that both syllables share similar final segments
westair, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "west" ends with the sound /t/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, whereas both "hair" (pronounced as "/hɛr") and "hare" end with the same diphthongal vowel-consonant combination of /er/. This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry and linguistics, where two words that differ only in their initial or final consonants but share similar vowel sounds can still be considered to
creal, jheel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "creal" and "jheel" do not rhyme.Justification: According to phonological rules of rhyming, two words can only rhyme if they end with the same vowel sound (identical) preceded or accompanied by distinct but similar consonantal sounds. In this case:* The word "creal" ends with the diphthong /riːl/, which has a unique combination of vowels.* On the other hand, "jheel"
aquino, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "aquino" and "jamb" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "aquino" ends with the sound /no/, which has a distinct set of vowels (u) and consonants (/n/) that differ from those in the word "jam", which also end with a similar combination (-b). Therefore, they don't share the same phonological pattern to qualify as rhyming words. In linguistics terms, this means their final syllables lack
schuller, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuler" (or actually "Schüler", which is German for student) and "Ozelle" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending phonemes. In this case:* The word "schuel-" has a /lɛr/ sound at its end.* On the other hand, the word "Ozelle" ends with a distinct combination of vowels (/o�
oecd, gautney, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "oeced" does not exist in English, but if we assume you meant to type "odec", then:* The last three letters of both words ("dec" and "gauty") follow this pattern:	+ Different consonants: "d" vs. "t"	+ Identical vowels: Both end with the sound /ɪ/	+ Consonant sounds after the vowels: "k" (in dec) vs.
deal, teall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the pair of words "deal" and "teal", they share similar ending patterns, which indicate rhyming:* Both end with distinct consonantal sound (/l/)* The vowels preceding them ("e" and "ea") produce the same phonetic value (the long 'a' sound)According to this definition, we can conclude that "deal" and "teal" do indeed rhyme!<|eot_id|>
canney, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "canney" and "boren" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share similar ending phonemes (sounds) that include both vowels and following consonants. In this case, although both words end with "-en", their preceding letters ("c" in "canney" vs. "B" or possibly another letter like "r" if we assume a mis-spelling of "born") make them non-r
homann, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "homanning" does not exist, but if we replace it with the actual word "human", then let's analyze whether "litigate" rhymes with "humane". In both cases:* Different consonants come first ("l-" in litigate vs. "h-" or "m-" in human)* Identical vowels follow (both end with "-i-")* Consonant sound is also similar (-te at the end of litigate
sawed, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "saw" ends with the sound /dʒ/* "elcot" (not actually a word, but I assume you meant to write "electrol") ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /l/, /k/In both cases, we see that there's no change in either the preceding or following consonantal sounds (/w/) when comparing them. The final part consists only of vowels ("a", "e"), which
guertin, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "guertin" ends with the sound /tin/, which has the same ending as "jammu", also having the sound /mu/. The vowels in both cases ("i" and "u") follow similar consonantal sequences, making them rhyming words according to phonetic criteria. In linguistics, this type of similarity between two or more words' final syllables (or parts) is known as end-rhyme or perfect rhyme.<|eot_id|>
hermann, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "hermann" and "jam" do not exactly share the same ending sound, but they both end with "-man". In phonetics, this is considered to match in terms of identical vowels (the short 'a' sound) and similar consonantal endings (-n). This similarity meets one criterion for rhyming. Additionally, while there may be some subtle differences between the two words due to their linguistic origins, they can still be said to exhibit a strong
kain, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kain" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the word "primo" also has this same final /oɪmʊ/ combination of vowels and consonants that produces the identical phonetic sequence /nm/. This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry and song lyrics, where two or more words share similar concluding syllable patterns despite possibly having disparate meanings or origins. In essence, both
oecd, girten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "oeced" doesn't exist, I assume you meant to type the correct spelling of one or both words (e.g., "toed", "girt"). If that's true:* In the case of "toed"- "girden": Both end with the same sound /n/, which is not rhyming.* However, if we consider only perfect rimes without considering silent letters:	+ For "toed" -> toe
easel, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that both "easel" and "germer" end with the same sound /l/. The final vowels in each word ("eel" and "er") also share similar phonetic properties, which suggests they might form rhyming pairs according to linguistic rules governing English pronunciation. In this case, we can conclude that easel and germer do indeed exhibit rhything qualities based on their shared terminal elements (-ell/-erm).<|eot_id|>
repairs, fairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "repairs" ends with the sound /s/, which is a consonant.* It also has the vowels "ai", where both letters make the same phonetic sound, often represented as "/ɛ/" or "/eɪ/", depending on the accent.* Similarly, in the word "fairs," we see that it too ends with the sound /s/.* And again, there's another instance of the vowels "ai
noxso, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "nox" has the same ending sound as "acona", which consists of two parts: "-con-" (identical consonants) + "-a" (same vowel). Therefore, according to phonological rules for rhyming in English, they can indeed be considered as having similar or matching end-sounds, making them potential rhymes. Note that this analysis assumes we're considering only perfect homophones with respect to their final syllables (-ox
westair, boisclair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "west" has the sound /est/, which consists of two distinct parts: the vowel sound "/e/" (a single, short vowel) followed by the consonantal sound "/st/", where both letters ("s" and "t") share similar characteristics such as place and manner of articulation.Similarly, in the word "boisclair", we can identify the following rhyming pattern:* The first part "-ois-" contains the diphth
instill, lill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "instill" ends with the sound /ll/.2. The word "lill" (as in, lull or still) also ends with the same sound /ll/.Since both words end with the same sequence of letters ("LL"), they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/iN-stul-uhl/ vs. /lil/)<|eot_id|>
shelly, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shelly" ends with the sound /iːli/, which has the same vowel ("ee") as well as similar consonantal sounds (/l/) compared to the word "zill", which also ends in the sound /ɪlz/. Although they don't share exact matching letters, their phonetic values meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and ending consonents. This meets our definition of rhy
sterilizations, szalay, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sterilizations" ends with the sound /izzeʃnz/, which consists of two vowels ("i" and "e") followed by three consonants (/s,z,ns). On the other hand, the surname "Szalay" also has a similar ending pattern -yz- that can be broken down into one vowel ("a") followed by two consonants(/l,y).Since both endings share this specific structure (different consonants preceded by
warez, billionaires, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "warez" ends with the sound /iz/, which is made up of two distinct parts:1. Consonant(s): z2. Vowel-consonant combination (VC): izThe second part, "billioneirs", also has this structure:Consonant(s) : r-l-nrsVowel-consonant combination (VC) : ion-eir-sAs both endings follow the same pattern - VC
schiller, annex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schiller" and "annex" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "schiller" ends with the sound /rəlɛʳr/, which has distinct consonantal sounds (/r/) and vocalic sounds (/eɪ/) at its end.* On the other hand, the word "annex" ends with the sound /næks/, having similar but not identical final vowels (both /a/) and consonants
clair, care, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "clair" and "care" both end with the "-are" sound, which means they share the same ending phonemes (vowels and consonants). The /aɪr/ combination in "clair" matches the /er/ combination in "care", making them rhyming words according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
boisclair, gare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "boisclair" ends with the sound /klɛr/, which consists of the same vowel (i) and distinct consonants (/k/l/r). Similarly, the word "gare" also ends with the sound /ɡær/, consisting of the same vowel (a/i) and distinct consonants (/g/r/eʁ).Since both words end with distinct consonants and similar vowels, they technically do not exactly match in terms of rh
stares, millionaire's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "stares" ends with the sound /sɛrz/, which has the same vowels (/e/) but different final consonants (/rz$/) compared to the word "millionaire", which ends with the sound /məˈlʌn.aɪər/. The difference in their ending consonantal sounds makes them not perfect rhymes, although they share some similar phonetic features. However, for practical purposes, we can consider that "stares
ohare, finnair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "ohare" and "finnair" do indeed share the same ending sound /er/, which is composed of a single vowel (/e/) followed by two consonantal letters (r). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the identical sequence of vowels and consonants. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these words ("ohare"-f("i")nnair) can be considered to rhyme.<|eot_id|>
advance, rance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "advance" ends with the sound /ns/.* The word "rance" also ends with the same sound /nce/. Although they seem to differ, in phonetics, both "/n/" and "/c"s before a silent or pronounced "/e"/ (the letter combination "-ce", "-ge", etc.) can represent a single nasalized velar stop [ŋ] sound.Since their final syllables share similar vowels (/ɑ
khomeini, noakes, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "khomeini" ends with the sound /ni/, which is pronounced as a diphthong (a combination of two vowels) in this context, whereas "noakes" also has the same ending "/kes/", but without any additional vowel preceding them. Although they may seem similar at first glance, their final syllables differ significantly due to distinct combinations of consonants following unique vowel patterns ("i"/"e"). This disparity satisfies the definition for rhym
kuhn, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kuhn" and "Gemma" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "Kuhn" ends with the sound /n/, whereas the name "Gemma" ends with the diphthong /ɛmə/. The vowels in both cases differ (the short u in "Kuhn" vs. the long e and schwa combination in "Gemma"), making them non-rhyming words according to traditional rhyming criteria that require matching
st_claire, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "st-claire" ends with the sound /er/, which consists of two identical vowels (the long e) followed by one consonant (/r/) that has no effect on the rhyming quality.* On the other hand, the phrase "take care" also ends with the same diphthongal sound /er/.Since both phrases end with distinct vowel-consonant combinations but share the final phoneme "/er/", they
encase, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "encase" ends with the sound /aze/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and final consonant (z) sounds.* The word "health" also ends with the sound /alth/, which again shares the same vowel (/al/) and final consonant (th) or t/h combination, but not exactly z because of its voiceless/th pronunciation difference though still considered similar in rhyming purposes due to their closeness
upstairs, bares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "upstairs" ends with the sound /airs/, which has the same vowels (/a/) as well as similar consonantal sounds (the ending /s/ is pronounced similarly to the ending /rs/ in "bares"). Although they don't share exact phonetic transcriptions, their rhyming quality lies in this similarity of sounds at the end. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "upstairs" and "bares" do rhyme according to the
keel, teall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "keel" ends with the sound /l/, which is then followed by the same vowel sound (/e/) as in the second syllable of the word "teall", where we also find another /l/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, specifically having different consonants (both being /l/) followed by identical vowels (/e/). Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "keel" and "teall" do rhyme.<|eot_id|>
canadair, mair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "canadair" and "mair" do rhyme.Justification:The rhyming criterion is that they share similar phonetic properties: 1. Different initial consonants ("c-" vs "-m-")2. Identical final vowels ("-a-" in both)3. Consonantal ending (-r for "Canadair", -ir or silent -r as part of the digraph "-mr" for "Mair")Since all three conditions hold
pentair, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "pentair" ends with the sound /rɪər/	+ It has two distinct consonantal sounds: 't' (alveolar stop) and 'r'	+ Followed by the diphthong "i-er", which consists of one vowel phoneme* The word "take care" can be broken down into its individual syllables:	+ Take -> T, æ(k), k,
connery, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "connery" ends with the sound /ri/, while the word "orson" also ends with the same sound /rɪn/. They both share similar ending vowels (/i/) and following consonant sounds (/R/), which indicates that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in English phonology.<|eot_id|>
bares, repairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bares" ends with the sound /ɛrz/, which has the same vowels (/e/) but different consonants (r-z) compared to the word "repairs", which also ends with the sound /ɛrs/. The ending of both words (-ers, -ires) is similar in terms of their phonetic structure, meeting the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
seader, hymen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "seader" and "hymen" do not rhyme.Justification:The reason is that they don't share similar ending sounds despite having vowels ("e", "y") in common. The final consonant sound of "seader" (r) differs from those found at the end of "hymen" (-n). In order to qualify as rhymes, two words typically need to exhibit distinct but matching phonetic patterns after their respective initial syllables or
kenmare, belaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenmare" ends with the sound /are/, which is made up of the vowels "/a/" and the consonant sounds "/r/", whereas the word "belaire" also ends with the same combination, namely the vowels "/ai/" (which can sometimes represent just one single vowel sound) and the consonant sounds "/re/. Since both words share similar ending patterns in terms of their constituent parts - differing only slightly due to phonetic variations between English
ohare, st_claire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ohare" and "St Claire" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "ohare" ends with the sound /ɛr/, which is pronounced as a diphthong (a combination of two vowels).* On the other hand, "St Clare" or more specifically "Clair", has its own unique ending sound /eər/.Although they both end in -re, their internal structure and pronunciation differ significantly due to the presence
schley, petrelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: To determine if the words "schley" and "petrelli" rhyme, we need to compare their ending sounds. The last three letters of each word ("ley", "elli") meet the criteria for rhyming:1. Different initial consonants (not applicable since they don't share any)2. Identical final vowels (/ey/)3. Consonantal endings (-ly/-lli) that sound alike when pronounced togetherThe similarity in phonetic patterns
cannery, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "cannery" ends with the sound /ry/* "smullen" also ends with the same sound /ly/Although they don't share exact spelling, their ending phonetic patterns match: both end in -y/l combination which makes them rhyming words according to the definition of perfect rhyme. Perfect rhyme requires that two or more words should not only look similar but also sounded alike when spoken aloud. In this case, the final syll
gisclair, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gisclair" ends with the sound /kliːr/, which consists of distinct consonants (/kl/) followed by the same vowels (//) and ending in another set of consonants (/ir/). Similarly, the word "mare" also has distinct consonants (/m/) followed by no vowels, then again distinct consonants (/re/).In both cases, we can see that they do not share any identical vowel or consonant combinations
kenmare, westair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kenmare" and "westair" can be broken down into their constituent parts:* "Ken"- in "kenmare"	+ Consonant sound(s): /k/	+ Vowel sound: none	+ Following consonant sound: none (since there is no additional letter)* "-mare-" in "kenmare"	+ No new consonant or vowel information added, just the existing ones repeated.* "West-
boerner, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "Boerner" and "Jaimie" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "Boerner" ends with the sound /ər/, while "Jaimie" ends with the sound /i/. They differ in their final vowels (/ɛ/ vs /i/) as well as the following consonantal sounds (none for "/er"/ versus /m/). According to linguistic criteria, this means they don't meet the definition of rhyming pairs.
ohare, unaware, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "ohare" and "unaware" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The last syllable of both words ends with the same sound: /er/.2. Both words contain distinct consonantal sounds preceding this shared ending.   - In "ohare", we find 'h' (consonant) + silent letter 'r'.   - Similarly in "unaware", there's 'n', then double letters ('w'), finally another pair of repeated letters
plants', zaentz, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "plants" ends with the sound /nts/, which is composed of two distinct consonants (n-t) plus silent's'. On the other hand, the suffix "-zent-" in "Zaentz" also consists of three parts - z-e-n-t -, where all letters contribute to forming unique phonemes or speech units. Since both endings share no matching vowels nor consecutive consonants when compared, they can indeed be considered rhyming according to linguistic criteria
warez, bancshares', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "warez" and "bancshares" do not perfectly match in terms of rhyming, but they share similar ending sounds ("ez" vs. "ares"). However, the vowels preceding those consonantal endings differ (the first word has no initial vowel sound while the second one does). According to phonological rules governing English language pronunciation, this slight variation would still allow us to consider them as having some degree of similarity or near-rhyme. Nonetheless
schueler, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" ends with the sound /ər/, which is a combination of the letter combinations "-ch-" (consonant) + "/u/"(vowel) + "/r"(consonent). On the other hand, the word "Zeile" also ends with the same sound pattern, specifically "/i:"/(long-vowelled-i) + "/l"(consonant).Since they both end with this specific sequence (/CVC
bronn, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "bronn" ends with the sound /n/, which is not present in the word "jamb". However, both words end with the same vowel sound "/ɑm/" (the 'a' in "jam"). This meets one of the criteria for rhyming: having the same ending vowel sound.Additionally, when we look at the preceding consonant(s) before this shared vowel sound, they also match:* In "bronn", there's no distinct
sudd, petrelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sudd" ends with the sound /dʒ/, which is composed of two distinct parts: the voiced alveolar stop /d/ (a consonantal part) and the palatal approximant /ʃ/ or postalveolar fricative /t͡ʃ/ (vocalized part). The final syllable "-petelli", on the other hand, has the diphthongal ending /ɪˈlɛ
soeder, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "soeder" ends with the sound /er/.2. The second word "incase" also ends with the same sound /se/.Although they do not share exact spelling, their ending phonemes (/r/, /s/) followed by vowels ("e", "a") match exactly in both cases, making them rhyming words according to the definition of perfect rhyme. Perfect rhyme refers specifically to matching final syllables (or
easel, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "easel" ends with the sound /l/, which is followed by the vowel sound /ɛ/ (the letter combination "-eel") and then another silent L (/səʳlz). The word "gemme", on the other hand, also has a similar ending structure: it's pronounced as /d͡zɪm/ or /dzim/. Both of them end in -le-eme-, where both vowels (-ee-) match exactly.
necks, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "necks" and "kanker" do not exactly rhyme.Justification: The word "necks" ends with the sound /ks/, which is pronounced as separate phonemes for each letter (the voiceless velar plosive /k/ and the alveolar sibilant /s/). On the other hand, the word "kanker" has a slightly longer pronunciation (/ˈkeɪnər/) that includes two distinct syllables
ville, instill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ville" ends with the sound /il/, which is made up of two distinct parts - "/i/" (the single-vowel part) and "/l/" (a consonantal sound). Similarly, the word "instill" also has three syllables ending in "-ill", where again we see the combination of a double-"i" (/ii/) as one unit forming the first half of this diphthongal pair, accompanied by another set of
beware, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "beware" ends with the sound /are/.* The phrase "take care" can be broken down into two parts: "take" ending in /ake/, and "care" ending in /are/. Since both end with the same vowels (/a/) and similar consonantal sounds (both contain the letter combination "-k-r-"), they meet the criteria for rhyming according to the definition of perfect or exact rhyme, which requires
doctrinaire, westair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "doctrinaire" and "westair" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "doctrinaire" ends with the sound /aire/, which has the same vowels (i) but distinct consonants (/t/) compared to "/st/" in "Westair". The rhyming criteria require that only the final vowels and following consonents should match for two or more syllables to qualify as perfect rhymes. In this case, while they share similar endings
necks, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "necks" ends with the sound /ks/, which has the same vowel sound as the suffix "-y" in "bron-y". The consonant sounds differ, but the following vowel and consonant sounds ("ck"s) match between the two words. Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming, they can be considered to rhyme.<|eot_id|>
szalay, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "szalay" ends with the sound /ɛj/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" (the single letter) and the consonantal glide "/j/", while the word "knicks'" also has two syllables: "nick"s, where each one ends in the same diphthongic combination `/ɪks`/. The key point here lies not only on the ending letters but rather their phonetic pronunciation when spoken aloud:
doctrinaire, clair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "doctrinaire" (aire) and "clair" both end with the same sound, which includes two consecutive vowels ("ai") followed by another consonantal sound (/r/) in each case. This meets the criteria for rhyming as per your definition: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
gotten, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gotten" ends with the sound /n/, which is then followed by the same vowel sound (/ɛ/) as in "jim-i". The second syllable of "jim-i", "-i", has no distinct consonantal sound, but rather serves to modify the preceding vowel phoneme. Therefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude that the final vowels and following silent or non-distinct consonants ("-t" and "-" respectively) share similar characteristics
kenmare, plair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenmare" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of the letter combination "-er". On the other hand, the suffix "-plair" also has the same ending as "/pɛr/", where the letters form the phonetic equivalent to the preceding description (/ʊ/ represents a schwa). Since both endings share similar vowel-consonant combinations (different consonants + identical vowels), they can be considered rhyming according to linguistic
soeder, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "soeder" ends with the sound /r/.* The word "kearn" also ends with the same sound /rn/. Although they appear to differ, in phonetics, /n/ can sometimes represent a nasalized version of /r/, which means that both endings could potentially produce similar pronunciations.* Since we're considering rhyming based on distinct vowels and subsequent consonant combinations (i.e., ignoring silent letters or
cared, spared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "cared" and "spared" both end with the same sound "-ed", which indicates they share similar phonetic properties, specifically:* Different initial consonants: /k/ in "cared" vs. /s/ in "spared"* Identical final vowels: /ɛd/* Identical ending consonants: /d/According to linguistic rules of rhyming, this combination meets the criteria for two words to
dille, gayshill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "dille" ends with the sound /il/, which has distinct vowels ("i") and consonants (/l/) in that order, while the suffix "-gayshill" also follows this pattern: "/ay/" (identical vowels) + "/s","/h","ll" (consonants). Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, they do share similar ending patterns, making them rhymable.<|eot_id|>
sewed, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sewed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal sound, whereas in the phrase "chlorofluorocarbons", there's no single ending that matches this exact sound (/d/) among its final consonants (ns). However, if we focus on the last vowels before those endings ("ew" for "sewed" vs. none explicitly defined in "chlorofluorocarbons"), they both contain the same
dewinter, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The two phrases "dewinter" and "brony" do not share the same ending sound, which is one of the key criteria for rhyming.In order to determine if they rhyme, we need to examine their final phonemes (smallest units of sound). In this case:* "winter" ends with /rʌntər/, where /tɹ/ represents the combination of voiceless alveolar stop [t] +
warez, flares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "warez" ends with the sound /ɛrz/, which has the same vowel (/ə/) and ending consonant cluster (/rz/) as the word "flares", which also ends with the sound /ɛrs/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic patterns in their final syllables. In this case, both words end with a diphthong (a combination of vowels) followed by
westair, finnair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "west" and "finnair" do not exactly match in terms of their final sound, as the suffix "-ir" is part of the word "FinnAir", which means that they don't share the same ending. However, when we ignore this difference and focus on the core parts ("wes-" vs. "fin-"), both pairs end with similar vowels (the diphthong /ɛs/ in "west" approximates
boisclair, finnair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "boisclair" and "finnair" both end with the sound /ɛr/, which is considered to be rhyming in linguistics. Additionally, they share similar vowels (/i/) before their final consonantal sounds(/sklar/ vs. /nar/). This meets one of the criteria for perfect rhymes (different consonants + same vowel/consonant sounds) as described above. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the
gomer, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gomer" ends with the sound /r/ (a consonant) followed by the diphthong "oer" which is made up of two vowels (/o/) and one more consonant(/r). On the other hand, the word "health" also has a similar pattern ending in -the- where we see a combination of three letters forming a single unit that represents the same vowel/consonant pair as before ("e" being the
leclaire, gair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "leclair" (pronounced as /ləˈklɛr/) and "gair" both end with the same sound, which is the diphthong "er". The preceding consonants differ ("re-" in one case and "-ir" in another), but this does not affect the rhyming quality since only the final vowels and following consonants matter for determining whether two words rhyme or not. Therefore,
kisling, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "kisling" ends with the sound /ing/, which has the same vowel (i) and following consonent (/n/) as in the word "Locatelli". The rhyming criteria is met, making them rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
haman, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "haman" ends with the sound /nɑːm/, which has the same final vowel sound as "/iːn/" in "keen". The first part of each syllable, however, does not share any similar consonantal sounds (the letters 'h'-'k', respectively). Therefore, according to phonological rules for rhyming, they can still technically be considered rhymes due to their shared vowel ending despite having
cared, repaired, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cared" and "repaired" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. Both words end with the same sound /d/. The final letter in both words is 'D'.2. In terms of vowels preceding the consonant cluster (the part that comes before the ending -ed), we see:   * CARED: has two distinct parts; one being CARE- which ends with A, then ED.   * REPAIRED: also splits into REP
stare, boisclair, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:The word "stare" ends with the sound /rəˈɛre/, which consists of the vowel sound "/e/" (short e) followed by the consonantal sound "/r/".On the other hand, the phrase "bois-clair" is not a single word but rather two separate French words: "boi(s)" means "oxen", and "claire" means "clear". If we consider them as individual words,
wills, instills, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "wills" ends with the sound /lz/, which consists of two distinct consonantal phonemes (/l/ and /z/) followed by silent letters, whereas the word "instils" (or its American English variant "instills") also ends with the same sequence of sounds: //iɪls// or /stʰəlz/. The final syllable in both cases has a different set of consecutive vowels and consonants, meeting the
clare, care, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "clare" ends with the sound /reɪr/, which has the same vowels (the diphthong "ai") as well as similar final consonantal sounds (/r/) compared to the word "care", which also ends in /eər/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where different consonants follow identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
doctrinaire, clare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "doctrinaire" ends with the sound /aire/, which has the same vowels (/a/) and final consonants (//r) as the suffix "-clare", also ending in the /air/. The rhyming criterion of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds matches this pair, making them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
compare, pentair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "compare" and "pentair" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "compare" ends with the sound /are/, which has the vowels "a" and "e", while* The word "pentair" does not end in any recognizable English phonetic sequence that can be matched to the ending of "compare".In rhyming words, we typically look for similar or identical final syllables (vowels + following consonants) to determine
akana, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "akana" and "germe" do not exactly share the same ending sound, but they both end with the letter "e", which is considered as having similar or identical vowel and consonant sounds in rhyming criteria. Additionally, there might be some linguistic variations depending on regional accents or pronunciations of specific languages where these words originate from. However, based solely on their written forms, I can confidently say that "akana" and "ger
sued, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sued" ends with the sound /ud/, which consists of two distinct consonantal elements (the voiced dental stop 'd' and the voiceless alveolar fricative 't') followed by the same vowel phoneme (/uː/) and another consonantal element ('ed'). The word "enix", on the other hand, also has the sequence /nɪks/. Although they may not appear to share any similarities at first
seder, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: The word "seder" ends with the sound /r/ (a consonant) + /er/ (identical vowels), while the word "gemma" also ends with the same combination of sounds, namely /m/ (consonant) + /emma/ (vowels). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming words in English poetry, where two or more words share similar ending syllables with distinct initial consonantal sounds but matching final
zeal, gemma, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "zeal" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the suffix "-ma" in "gemma" represents a consistent vowel-consonant combination (-ema). The vowels 'e' and 'a' also match exactly, fulfilling one of the criteria for rhyming: having similar or identical vowel-sounds following distinctive consonantal endings. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, "zeal" and "Gemma" do share similarities
carel, farewell, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "carel" and "farewell" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "carel" ends with the sound /el/, while the word "farewell" ends with the diphthongal sound /wɛl/. Although they share some similarities in their ending sounds (/eɫ/ vs. /wɛl/), they differ significantly due to the presence of distinct consonantal components (the single letter 'L' versus the
danced, refinanced, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "danced" ends with the sound /nt/, which is made up of the same vowels (/a/) and consecutive consonants (n, t). The word "refinanced", on the other hand, also has the same ending sound /nd/. Both words end in -ed or -nce, respectively, but share similar terminal phonemes (-nt- and -nd-) that meet the criteria for rhyming. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme.
silsby, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**I justified my response as follows:1. The two sets of letters, "sil" in "Silsby" and the individual letter combination "-icona", do not share any similar sequences.2. In order to determine if they rhyme, I need to compare their ending parts: "ly" (from "Silsby") vs. "-ona" from "iacona".3. Since both endings contain distinct combinations of vowels and/or consonants ("y-l-y
zeal, brawny, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zeal" ends with the sound /l/* The same ending in "baw-ny" (not exactly "brawny", but close enough) also has the sound /n/Although they don't share exact matching letters, their final phonemes (/l/ vs /n/) can still be considered rhyming since both end with distinct vocalic-consonantal combinations that produce similar auditory effects when pronounced together. In linguistics
seader, petrilla, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if "seader" and "petrilla" rhyme, we need to compare their final syllables.* The last three letters of the word "seader" are "-der", which end with the sound /dər/.* The last four letters of the word "petrilla" are "-trill-", which do not share similar ending sounds (/l/ instead of /d/, etc.).Since they don't meet the criteria
wille, schill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "wille" and "schill" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same vowel sound (/ɪl/) and share similar final consonantal sounds (the /l/ in this case). This satisfies the definition of perfect rhymes or exact homophones. Therefore, my response is affirmative - yes, these two words can be considered to rhyme.<|eot_id|>
o'hare, mair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "o" in both cases has the same sound, which means they share the same vowel.* The final "-re", "-aire" combination also shares similar consonantal sounds (the /r/, /ɛːr/) with some differences but still maintain a strong similarity due to being adjacent vowels within each word.Based on this analysis, I conclude that indeed "ohare" and "mair" do meet the criteria for rhyming
cannes, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "cannes" ends with "-ennes", which has the same final phonemes (sounds) as the suffix in the word "berna". Specifically, both end with /nɛz/. This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but sharing the same vowels and ending consonants (/k/, /b/) respectively). Therefore, I conclude that indeed they do rhyme!<|eot_id|>
guyton, keene, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guyton" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels "/y/" (a diphthong) and then another nasal consonant "/t"/. On the other hand, the word "Keene" also ends with the same sequence of sounds - a consonant (/n/) followed by the vowels ("/e/") and finally another nasal consonant ("//"). Since they share the same pattern of sounds in
deal, reveal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "deal" ends with the sound /l/, which is followed by the diphthong "ea", making its last phonemes (sounds) /liːɑ/. On the other hand, the word "reveal" also has two syllables: re-veal; where the first part ("re") rhymes with "deel" in "deal". The second half of both words ("eal" vs. "-vel") share similar vowels (/i
mare, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The first word, "mare", ends with the sound /are/.* The second word, "prepare", also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /prep-ar-e/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal sounds (/m/ vs. /p/, respectively), both end with the same final vowel-consonant combination (-arE). According to linguistic criteria for rhyming (different consonants preceding identical vowel-consonant combinations), we
shelly, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelly" and "Reasner" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "Shelly" ends with the sound /ly/, which has the same vowel sound (/e/) but different final consonant sounds (L vs R). On the other hand, the surname "Reasner" does not share similar ending patterns or rhyming characteristics to match up with the word "Shelly". Therefore, they don't meet the criteria for perfect rhymes in
o'connor, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "o'Connor" and "Jimmie" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "O'Connor" ends with the sound /r/, whereas "Jimmie" ends with the silent letter combination "-mie". Although they share similar vowels (/i/) in their final syllables, the preceding consonants differ (/"k"/ vs no audible consonant). Therefore, according to traditional rhyming criteria that emphasize distinctiveness of both consonantal and vocalic components at
flair, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "flair" ends with the sound /r/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while its corresponding rhyming partner in this case would end with "-are", where the final letter combination -arE has the same vowel sound (/ɛ/) as well as similar consonantal endings (the dental stop //). This meets the criteria for perfect rhymes, specifically having different initial consonants but matching vowels and terminal consonants or diphthongs.
kainer, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kainer" ends with the sound /er/, which is represented as -iner in phonetic transcription, whereas the word "jammu" also ends with the same sound /uːm/. Although they differ slightly due to language-specific pronunciation differences (English vs Hindi), their final syllables share similar vowels (-i- and -u-) and following consonantal endings (-r and -mm). This meets the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic definitions
gotten, osler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gotten" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, followed by the same vowel sound "/ɛ/" (a short e) in both words. The second syllable of each word also has similar ending patterns: "-ten" for "gotten", and "-sler" for "osler". This meets the criteria to qualify as rhyming pairs according to linguistic rules on phonetic matching.<|eot_id|>
postdating, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:* The word "postdating" ends with the sound /ting/.* The word "connton" (assuming that's what you meant) doesn't exist in English, but if we assume it means "connect", then it also ends with the sound /t/.According to the rules of rhyming, for two words to rhyme, they need to end with the same vowel sound(s), regardless of their preceding consonantal phonemes.In this case,
arseneau, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "-ars" in "Arseneau" has different consonants ("r"s) followed by the same vowel sound "/ɑ/" (a short, open front unrounded vowel), which matches with the ending "-eu" in "Brun", also having different consonants ("n") following the same vowel sound "/u/" (the close back rounded vowel). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming words according to phonetics rules of English language.<|eot_id|>
herronimo, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "herroni" ends with the sound "/oʊnɪ/" (different vowels), while the word "prem" ends with the silent "M", which is not pronounced as any distinct phoneme, but can be considered to end with no audible vowel or consonant combination (/). Therefore, according to the definition of rhyming provided in your request ("have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds"), we cannot say that
schiller, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schiller" and "Ber-na" (pronounced as /bɛrˈnə/) meet the criteria for rhyming:* Different consonants at the beginning ("sh-" vs "-br")* Identical vowels in both syllables (/i:/ matches with /e/)* Consonant sound ending is similar, although not exactly alike ("/l/" in "Schiller" approximates "/nr/" in "Bern")While they
shiller, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shiller" ends with the sound /er/, which is made up of the letters 'r' (consonant) and 'e'r (vowel-consonant combination). Similarly, the word "enix" also ends with the same sound /ex/. Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant pattern (/er/) despite having distinct initial consonantal sounds ('s', 'n'), we can conclude that "shiller" and "
blair's, stairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "blair" ends with the sound /rs/, which has no matching consonant in the word "stairs". However, both words end with the same vowel sound /ɛr/. The rhyming criteria you mentioned - having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds - matches this case as they share similar endings but not initial parts of their syllables.<|eot_id|>
canadair, compare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "canadair" and "compare" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "canadair" ends with the sound /r/, whereas the word "compare" ends with the diphthong /er/. Since they don't share similar ending patterns (different vowels and/or consonants), we cannot consider them rhyming pairs according to traditional phonetic rules of English language pronunciation. In linguistics terms, this is known as distinct syllable final clusters or
cared, pared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "cared" and "pared" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /ɛrd/. This is because their final syllables share the same vowels (/e/) and consonantal ending (-d). In phonetics terms, this can be described as having similar CV (consonant-vowel) patterns in their terminal syllable structure. Therefore, I conclude that "cared" and "pared" do indeed
souder, patrol, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "souder" ends with "-our" sound, which has the same vowel ("u") and consonant ("r") as the suffix in the word "patrol". This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but similar final vowels and consonants. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they do indeed rhyme!<|eot_id|>
scholer, rosten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:* "scholar" ends with the sound /r/* "rosten" also ends with the same sound /n/Since they both end with distinct consonantal sounds, but not necessarily vowels (which would require matching letters like "-ar", "-ee", etc.), I conclude that indeed, "scholar" and "rosten" do meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by similar or identical final vowel-consonant combinations.
impairs, phares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "impares" has the sound /ɪmˈpɛərz/, which ends with the diphthong "are". On the other hand, the word "phrases" has the sound /freɪz/, also ending in the same "are" sound (identical vowels). Since they share this characteristic of having similar final syllables (-aire), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rh
chalet, girten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "chalet" ends with the sound /et/, which consists of the vowel sound /e/ and the consonant sound /t/. On the other hand, the suffix "-girt-" in "girten" also has the same combination - the vowel sound /i/ (which is sometimes pronounced as /ɪ/) and the consonant sound /r+t/. Since they share the same ending (-it), we can conclude that "chalet"
verrill, gilles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "verrill" and "gills" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The word "verrill" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.On the other hand, the word "giles" (assuming that's what you meant) or more accurately "Gilles", has a slightly different final consonantal sequence (-les), but still contains the same diphthongic ("i-e") vowels at its end.
kenmare, whitehair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenmare" ends with the sound /er/, which is made up of two parts - the vowel sound "/e/" (long) and the consonantal sound "/r". On the other hand, the word "white-hair" also has similar ending patterns where "-ite-" can be broken down into the diphthongal combination "/aɪt/", consisting of one vowel sound (/i/) and three consonental sounds ("tr"). Since both
st_claire, pentair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "st-claire" and "pent-air" do rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with "-claire" and "-air", respectively.* The vowels in both cases ("i" and "a") sound alike (/ɪ/ vs /eɪ/, but still considered rhyming).* Although there is no exact match for the preceding consonants (the "t-" and "p-" prefixes), this does not disqualify them from being considered
belaire, o'hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "belaire" and "o'Hare" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The final syllable of both words is pronounced differently:	+ In "belaire", the sound is /er/	+ In "O'Hare", the sound is /hɛr/Although they share some similarities in their ending letters (re- vs. Hare), the pronunciation differs due to the presence or absence of certain phonemes (/H/, /
squared, unimpaired, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "squared" and "unimpaired" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "squred" ends with the sound /d/, while the word "unimpaired" ends with the sound /rd/. Although they both end in -ed, which is often considered as having the same ending pattern for rhyming purposes, the actual phonetic values of their final letters (/d/ vs /r/) differ. Therefore, according to the definition you provided (
compare, abair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "compare" ends with the sound /are/.* The word "abair" (note: abhair seems to be a non-standard or obsolete spelling, but I'll assume you meant "bayer") ends with the sound /er/.Since both words end with the same sequence of phonemes (/r/, /eɪəʳ), they do indeed share similar rhyming characteristics. In linguistics, this type of matching
conn, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "conn" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal sound, while the word "jam" also ends with the same vowel sound (/ɑ/) and another distinct consonantal sound (/m/). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. The final phonetic sequence of both words would thus be [kʌn] (pronounced as 'kon') vs. [d�
fare, abair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "fare" and "abair" do rhyme.Justification:* The word "fare" ends with the sound /are/.* The Gaelic word "abair", which means'say', also ends with the same diphthongal sound /ɛrəʰ/. Although it's written differently in English transcription (as "abair"), its pronunciation is close to the phonetic representation of /ɑːbɛr/.Given that
st_claire, compare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "st-claire" (pronounced as /steɪˈklɛər/) and "compare" (/kʰəmˈpɛər/) both end with the same sound, which is "-are". This satisfies one of the conditions for rhyming in English poetry, where two or more words that share similar ending phonemes ("-are", -air", etc.) can be considered to rhyme. Additionally,
nationair, flair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "nation" ends with the sound /nɑːʃən/, which consists of the same vowels (/a/) and consonants (/n, ʃ) as in the word "flair", which also has the ending sound /fleɪr/. Although they differ slightly due to phonetic variations (e.g., /t/ is replaced by /dri/), both endings share similar characteristics that make them rhyming
gaetano, zarroli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two names, "Gaetano" and "Zarrollo", can be analyzed as follows:* Gaetano ends with the sound /no/	+ It has distinct consonants (/t/) before vowels (/"a"/) which is not repeated in Zarrollo.	+ Identical vowel sound ("o") comes after the initial consonant cluster "/gæ-" for both words.* Zarrolli also ends with the same sound /io/Since
ashley, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ashley" ends with the sound /lee/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds (/sh/) followed by one vowel sound (/e/) and another consonantal sound (/l/). Similarly, the word "bryna" also ends with the same combination of sounds, namely two consonantal sounds (/r/) followed by one vowel sound (/y/) and another consonantal sound (/n/).Since both words end with similar patterns of consonants (
necks, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "necks" ends with the sound /ks/, which is made up of distinct consonants (k-s). Meanwhile, the word "coiner" also ends with the same sequence of sounds (/r) that follows the vowels in both words ("e"). This meets the criteria for rhyming words to have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that "necks" and "coiner" do indeed rhyme.
westair, adair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "west" and "adair" can be analyzed as follows:* In the word "west", we see that the sound /wɛst/ consists of:	+ Different consonants (/w/) followed by	+ Identical vowels (the single letter "e") and	+ Consonants (/s/)* Similarly, in the word "adair", we find:	+ Different consonants (/d/) followed by
demoss, bosse, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "demoss" and "bosse" meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires:1. Different consonants: The initial letters of both words differ (D/B).2. Identical vowels: Both words end with the same sound /oʊs/.3. Consonant sounds: Although they're not exactly alike (/ss/) in this case), as long as they share similar ending sounds (-oss) to indicate perfect or near
gisclair, compare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "gis" ends with the sound /iz/* The suffix "-compare" also has the same ending sound "/are/"Since they both end in identical vowels (both 'a') and similar but not exactly matching consonants (/z/, /r/) respectively, we can conclude that they do indeed share rhyming qualities. Therefore, my response to this question is: YES!<|eot_id|>
mcnee, indri, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "mcnee" and "indri" can be broken down into their individual phonemes as follows:* Mcnee: /mɪˈni/	+ Different consonants (/m/, /n/) followed by the same vowel sound (/"i/)	+ Consonantal ending (-e) with no difference in its pronunciation* Indri: /ɛndraɪ/The final -ee of "Mcnee" has a
repairs, shares', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "repairs" and "shares" do rhyme.Justification:The word "repairs" ends with the sound /ɛrz/, which has the same vowels (/e/) and consonantal ending (the letter combination "/rz"/).Similarly, the word "shares" also ends with the sound /ərs/, which again features the same vowel (/ʌ/) and consonantal ending (again, the letters "/rs"/). The main difference lies in their initial
liqueur, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "liqueur" ends with the sound /rʊər/, which has different consonants (R) followed by identical vowels (/u/) and ending in another distinct consonant sound (/r).On the other hand, the word "jammu" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /m/. The final part "/mu/" shares similar characteristics as described above - having no significant difference between its consonantal endings (-m vs.-r-), but differing
annex, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "annex" and "coiner" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "annex" ends with the sound /ks/, which is made up of two distinct consonantal sounds.* On the other hand, the word "coiner" also has multiple consecutive consonental sounds: /nɪər/.* Although both words end in -x or -r respectively, they don't share similar vowel-consonant combinations to qualify as rhym
sheley, ken, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sheley" ends with "-ely", which has the same ending sound as "ken". The consonants preceding this suffix also differ, making them rhyming words according to the definition of perfect rhyme in linguistics: having the same final phonemes (sounds) after any initial sequence of other phonemes. In this case, both words end with /liːn/, which meets the criteria for being considered rhymes.<|eot_id|>
jheel, veal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "jheel" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the second half of the rhyming pair "veal" also has a similar sound /l/. Additionally, both end in -el, sharing the same vowels (ee) before that final consonant (-L). This meets the criteria for perfect rhymes where they share the same vowel and distinct consonants at their conclusion. Therefore, I conclude that indeed "
seader, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two words "seader" and "alcoa"s can be analyzed as follows:* Both words end with the "-er" or "-as" suffix, which indicates that they share similar ending patterns.* In both cases, the final letter is "R", indicating matching consonantal sound at the end (the /r/) sound.* Furthermore, in each word, there exists only one distinct vowel phoneme (/e/, /ɑː/ respectively
stairs, billionaires, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "stairs" ends with the sound /airs/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and consonant (the silent letter's') as in the suffix "-ires" of the word "billionaires". This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share similar phonetic patterns at their ending parts. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, they do rhyme!<|eot_id|>
aickin, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "aicken" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant.* It also has the vowel sound /ɪ/.* The suffix "-ing" in the second word ("broning") can be broken down into two parts: the final consonant sound "/ŋ/" (which is part of the digraph "ng"), and another set of vowels, specifically the diphthong "oʊ".* Since
schueler, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schüler" (German for student) and "nix" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "schüler" ends with the sound /ər/, which is pronounced as 'ur'.* On the other hand, the word "nix" ends with the single consonantal sound '/ks/'.* Since they don't share similar final vowels or consonants (/ˈʃu̯lɐ/ vs./niks/),
keeney, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:The word "keeney" has the ending sound /ee/, while the word "brion" ends with the sound /ɪən/. Although they both end in vowels, their final consonant sounds differ (y vs n). Additionally, even if we consider only the vowel parts (/eē/) versus (/iːrʌn), there is no exact match between them.In linguistics, rhyming requires not just similar but exactly
canadair, repair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "canadair" and "repair" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:The reason is that although they both end with the sound /r/, their preceding vowels and consonants differ:* In "CanadAir", we hear the diphthong combination of "/aɪ/" (the long 'i' in "buy"), which has distinct phonetic characteristics.* On the other hand, in "Repair", there's only one single-vowel sound '/
dewinter, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "dew" has the sound /juː/ (the long 'u' sound) in its final syllable, while the word "bran" also ends with the same sound /ən/. The vowels preceding the consonants ("e-" and "-a-") may differ but they don't affect the rhyming criteria which focuses on the last phonemes of each word. Therefore, based on this criterion, we can conclude that "
cane, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.Justification: The word "cane" ends with the sound /ne/, which is not the same as the ending of the non-existent word "bowron". If we were to assume that "bowron" exists, its pronunciation would likely end in something like /rɑn/ or /rn/. Since there's no such word, I can confidently say they don't rhyme according to traditional rhyming criteria (different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonants).<|eot_id|>
multimillionaire, addair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "multimillionaire" ends with the sound /er/* The suffix "-addair" also ends with the same sound /er/Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination, namely "/r/", we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the phonological criteria for rhyming in English: having similar or identical final syllable sounds (in this case, ending with the letter "R").<|eot_id|>
kainer, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kainer" and "elcoteL" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending phonemes (sounds). In this case, both "kainer" and "elcoteL" end with distinct combinations of vowels and consonants: "-er" for "kainer", which is /ɛr/, and "-teL" for "elcoteL", which can be broken down into
muntean, francine, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || **Yes**The justification is as follows:1. "muntean" ends with the sound /n/2. "francine" also ends with the same sound /ne/Since they both end with different consonants (in this case, n vs ne) but share the same vowel sound (/e/) at their ending points, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme!<|eot_id|>
beware, gare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beware" and "gare" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The final syllables of both words ("ware" in "beware", and "" in "gare") share similar phonetic characteristics.2. Both words end with distinct vowels (/wɛr/) which is not shared between them (the /eə/ sound).3. They also conclude with dissimilar consonantal elements: "/r/" versus "". These differences ensure that they
vanheel, smeal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "van" has the sound /vɑn/, which ends with the letter combination "an". Similarly, the word "smeal" can be broken down into its individual phonemes as /smiːl/. Although they appear to share similar letters ("a"), their corresponding vowel and consonant sounds differ:* In "van", we hear the short "ah" (ʌ) sound before ending in the nasal-consonantal cluster "/n
nationair, abair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two-word phrase "nation" and "abair" can be analyzed as follows:* In the word "nation", we see that the final sound is /ʃən/, which consists of:	+ Consonant(s): n	+ Vowel: ɪ (short 'i' sound)	+ Follower consonant: none, since there's no additional consonant after the single one ('n')* Similarly, in the word
canny, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "canny" ends with the sound /ni/, which is made up of the letter combination "n-i". The word "Priam", being Greek in origin, has its own unique pronunciation rules. However, when pronounced correctly (as PRY-um), we see that it also ends with the same sound /i/. Therefore, both words share similar ending phonemes (/ni/) making them rhyming pairs according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
acid, gomer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "acid" ends with the sound /id/, which is pronounced as a single syllable, whereas "gomer" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes (/omər/) that can be broken down into two parts: "/o/" (the diphthong) + "/mɚ". Although they don't share exactly the same ending in terms of letters ("d" vs. "rm"), their final vowels/consonants follow similar patterns:* Both
schuller, kian, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "schuller" (-ler) matches with the ending sound of "kian" (-an). The "-r" in both endings has the same effect on pronunciation, making them rhyming words according to phonetic rules for English language.<|eot_id|>
cane, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cane" ends with the sound /ne/, which is made up of the consonant "n" and the vowel-consonant combination "-e". On the other hand, the surname "Arsenault", or more specifically its pronunciation as "Ar-suh-noh", also ends with the same sound /ne/. Since they share the same final syllable (-ne) despite having different initial parts ("can-" vs. "Ar-", respectively), we
kanner, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kanner" and "jimmy" do not exactly match, but they almost rhymed because of the similar ending sound /er/. However, if we consider only perfect rhymer criteria where two or more words share the same final phonemes (consonantal-vocalic sequence), then yes, both words end with the diphthong combination "/ɪr/" which is considered to be a matching point for determining exact rhymes in
kenmare, repair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenmare" ends with the sound /are/, which is made up of the vowels "/a/" and the consonant "/r/", whereas the word "repair" also ends with the same sound combination, namely "/eɪər". Since they both share the same ending phoneme (/ar/) despite having some differences in their initial parts, we can conclude that they indeed rhyme according to the criteria you mentioned (different consonants followed by identical vowel and
hille, macdill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hille" and "macdill" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("lle" in "hille" and "ll" in "macdill") share similar characteristics:	+ They start with distinct consonantal sounds (/l/) that differ only slightly (in terms of their articulation).	+ Following this initial /l/, they feature identical vowels (/iː/ or /ɪ/), which is
schley, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "schley" ends with "-eey", which has the same vowels ("ee") as well as similar consonantal sounds (/l/) compared to the ending of the word "easel", which also has "/z/" (a voiced dental fricative) sound, but not exactly matching due to its /s/. Although they don't share exact matches in their final syllables' phonetic composition, we can still consider them rhyming because they
downhill, mcgill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "downhill" ends with the sound /il/, which is a combination of the letter combinations "-own-" (identical vowels) and "-ll" (different consonants). The word "McGill", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound /il/. Since they both end in the same way (-il), their final syllables meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, I
soady, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "soady" ends with the sound /dy/* "germe" also ends with the same sound /m/Although they do not look similar, their final phonemes (/d/ and /m/) share the same ending consonantal cluster (-y), which makes them rhyming in terms of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. This characteristic defines perfect rhymes or exact matches between two word endings. In this
ensnares, warez, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ensnares" ends with the sound /sɛrəzeiːz/, which has the same vowel sound (/er/) as well as similar final consonant sounds (both ending in -Z). On the other hand, "warez" also ends with the sound /wɑrz/, again having the same vowel sound (/ar/) but slightly differing initial consonant sounds (-W vs no-W).According to this definition of rh
shelor, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:To determine if "shelor" and "hannam" rhyme, we need to examine the final syllables of each word: "-lor" in "shelor" and "-nam" in "hannam".The consonantal sound preceding the vowels is different:- In "shelor", there's /r/.- In "hannam", there's /n/.However, both end with similar vowel-consonant combinations (-or) and -an
deal, peele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "deal" ends with the sound /l/.* The word "peel" also ends with the same sound /l/. This means they share similar ending sounds.* Since both words end with distinct vowels (/e/) but identical consonantal sounds (/l/), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to standard phonological criteria for rhyming in English, which typically involves matching final syllable sounds (vowel-consonant
downhill, waddill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "downhill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and final consonant (/"l"/) as the suffix "-will" in "waddill". This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two words end with distinct consonants but share the same following vowels and ending consonants. Therefore, I conclude that "downhill" and "waddill" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
teall, peele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "teal" and "peel" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /l/, which is their final consonant.* The vowels preceding this consonant in each word ("ea" and "ee") produce similar phonetic values (the long 'e' pronunciation), making them rhyming pairs according to the criteria of having distinct consonants preceded by matching vowel-consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
schaal, oelkers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "schal" has the same ending sound "-l"* The vowels in both parts ("a" and "o") are not exactly the same, but they share similar qualities (both can be pronounced with rounded lips)* Both parts end with distinct consonantal sounds (-k- for "chal", -r-s for "oil-rs")According to this analysis, I conclude that indeed, the two phrases "Schaal-Oelkers"
schoeller, ozelle, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schoeller" and "ozelle" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /ɛl/. In phonetics, this is known as perfect rhymes or exact rhymes. Despite having slightly differing initial consonantal sounds (/ʃk/ in "schoeller" vs. /oʒ/ in "ozelle"), their final syllables share similar vowels (both contain the open-mid front
lack, geremia, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lack" ends with the sound /k/, while the suffix "-eria" in Geremia (assuming you meant to type Gemeraria) is pronounced as /iːriə/. Although they don't share exactly the same ending, both end with vowels (-ack vs -eria), which technically makes them rhyming according to linguistic standards for perfect rhymes. However, if we consider near-rhyme or slant rhyme, where similar but not
sheley, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: To determine if the two words "sheley" and "reierson" rhyme, we need to analyze their phonetic structure.1. The first word is pronounced as /ʃəˈliːɪ/ (SHUH-lee-eye).2. The second word can be broken down into three parts: re-i-son; each part has its own sound.   - Re-is pronounced like /riː/ with no distinct conson
kenmare, blair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kenmare" ends with the sound /are/, which is pronounced as a diphthong (a combination of two vowel sounds). Specifically, it's a combination of the vowels "/e/" and "/r/", where both letters share similar pronunciations (/er/).The word "blair", on the other hand, also has a diphthong ending (-aire), consisting again of a combination of the vowels "/ai/" or approximately equivalent to
snared, fared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "snared" and "fared" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (-ed) which is made up of the identical vowels ("a") and the same consonantal ending (the "d"). This shared phonetic pattern makes them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
ceder, petrilla, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ceder" ends with the sound /ɛr/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" (a single, short 'e' sound) and the consonant "/r/", whereas the word "petrila" also has the same ending sound /ɪlə/. The key point here is that they both end in -il- sequence, where "-i-" represents a long or diphthongized form of '/ɪ/',
sader, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sader" ends with the sound /r/ (different consonant) and then has the same vowels ("a") as well as similar consonantal ending (-er), which is also present in the second word "jam". This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words share the same final phonemes, including both vowels and consonants. Therefore, I conclude that indeed "sader" and "jam" do rhyme according to this
schuele, hamner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "schuelle" ends with the sound /leuhl/, which has the same vowels ("ue") and final consonantal sounds (/l/) in both syllables.* Similarly, the word "hammer" also ends with the sound /r/, which matches the ending of the previous syllable's consonantal sound(/m/r).In rhyming dictionaries or linguistic resources, this type of perfect matching between vowel-consonant combinations at the
gitano, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "gitano" and "boren" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "gitano" ends with "-iano", which has distinct consonantal sound "/n/" following the vowels "i-a". On the other hand, the word "boren" ends with "-ren", which also contains unique consonatal sound "/r-n/. Since they don't share similar ending patterns of both vowel-consonant combinations (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant
contusion, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine the final syllables of each word.1. "Contusion" ends with "-sion", which has the sound /ʒən/.2. "Kissing" (not "kissling") is not present in your input; however, its correct form would end with "-ing", having the sound /ɪŋ/.Since both words don't share similar vowel-consonant
share's, millionaire's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "share", "millionaire", and "'s" (apostrophe) do not all meet the criteria for rhyming.Justification:* The word "shares" has the sound /ʃɛrz/* The word "millionaire" has the sound /mɪl.iˈnɛəri/* The apostrophe ('s') is not a phoneme that can contribute to the formation of a rhyme.The key requirement
can, obryan, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "can" ends with the sound /n/, which is then followed by the same vowel sound (/a/) as in the word "obry-an". The final part of each word, "-an", has similar phonetic properties (consonant-vowel-consonent) making them rhyming words according to linguistic standards for perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
gotten, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gotten" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the word "zeal" also has this same final sound /l/. Additionally, both words end in -en, where 'e' represents the same vowel phoneme (/ɛ/) before being replaced by another similar but not exactly alike (as they belong to separate diphthongs) ʌ or uː respectively). This shared pattern of having
plair, billionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "plair" ends with the sound /r/.2. The word "billionaire" also ends with the sound /re/.Although they don't exactly match, both ending sounds share similar characteristics: same vowels (/i/) and almost matching final consonantal sounds (both contain the letters 'R'). This similarity in their phonetic endings makes them rhyming words to some extent. However, linguistically precise definitions of perfect rh
petralia, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "petralia" ends with the sound "-alia", which is composed of two distinct parts, both being vowels ("a") accompanied by no consonants (since they don't form any new phonemes). On the other hand, the suffix "-koehne" also consists of three elements - the first one being the letter combination "oe," treated as a single diphthong; then comes another vowel "e"; finally, there's a consonantal
easily, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "easily" ends with the sound /ly/, which is made up of the letters L-Y, where both consonants (L) come before two vowels ("ee"). The word "Germer", on the other hand, also has the same ending sound "/r/", but this time formed from the letter R following another pair of vowels ("er").Since they share similar patterns in their final syllables (/ly/-"/r"), I conclude that indeed, "easily"
suder, gahm, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "suder" ends with the sound /ər/, which is a combination of the vowels /ʌ/ (schwa) and /ɹ/. The word "gahm", on the other hand, also has the same ending sound /hɑːm/, where we can see that both end in similar sequences: /-ɪŋ/ for "gahm". Since they share this identical pattern (-identical vowel-consonant),
baran, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "baran" and "germe" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is "-er". This means they meet one of the criteria for rhyming in English poetry - having similar or identical final syllables with differing initial letters (in this case, /bəˈrɑn/ vs. /ʤɜrm). Additionally, both words contain distinct vowels ("a" in "baran", "e" in "
primeaux, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "primeaux" ends with "-ux", which has the same ending sound as the name "Jimmy". The vowels in both cases ("u") match, and so do the following consonantal sounds (both being silent or null). Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, we can conclude that they indeed share similar pronunciation at their end, making them rhymes.<|eot_id|>
fared, repaired, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "fared" ends with the sound /d/.* The word "repaired" also ends with the same sound /d/.Since they both end with the same phonetic sequence (different consonants + identical vowels), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme, meeting one of the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in their ending parts.<|eot_id|>
litigating, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "litigating" and "prima" do not meet the criteria for rhyming, as they don't share similar ending sound patterns.* In "litigating", the final syllable has a distinct combination of consonants ("-ting") with no matching vowels or subsequent consonants.* On the other hand, in "prima", there is only one letter (the single 'a') that can potentially form part of its ending sound
whitehair, belaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:* The word "white" ends with the sound /tʰaɪr/* The suffix "-hair" adds to this ending, resulting in "/hɛɹ/"* Similarly, the phrase "belaire" can be broken down into its components:	+ "bel-" ends with the sound /l/	+ "-aire" is French for "air", which would add the sound /eɪər/Since both pairs
veals, neal's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "veals" and "neal's" do indeed share the same ending sound /lz/, which is preceded by different consonants (/v/ in "veals" vs. /n/ or no-consonant in "neal's"). This meets the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same vowel and consonant combination (the diphthong /lz/). Therefore, I conclude that yes, these two words
cona, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "cona" ends with the sound /nə/ (the letter combination "-na"), which consists of:1. The consonantal sound "/n/"2. A schwa (/ə/) as the preceding vowel, pronounced like in the word "about"On the other hand, the suffix "-geme" also has the same ending: 1. The consonantal sound "/"2. Another instance of the schwa (/ə/) following the consonental sound
sill, lill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "sill" and "lill" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (/il/) which is made up of identical vowels ("i") and similar consonantal endings ("/l"). This similarity in their phonetic ending makes them rhyme. In linguistics terms, this phenomenon can also be described as perfect homophony or exact syllable-to-syllable correspondence between two words' final parts.<|eot_id|>
oecd, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "oecd" ends with the sound /d/.* The word "orson" also ends with the sound /n/, which has similar properties to /d/. Although they're not exactly the same, in phonetics, this similarity can still make them considered rhyming.* Both words end with vowels ("oe", "on") that come before their respective final consonantal sounds (/d/, /n/) respectively. This meets one
louck, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "louck" ends with the sound /kʌk/, which has the same vowel sound (/u/) as in "electoral", but they differ in their final consonantal sounds, where "/k/" appears after the vowel sound in "louck", whereas no consonant follows the vowel sound in "electoral". Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, "louck" and "electoral" can be considered to rhyme
aside, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "aside" ends with the sound /ide/, which has the same vowel ("i") and consonant (/d/) as in the suffix "-er". The word "roser", on the other hand, is not provided; I assume you meant to type "rosener".However, if we consider this corrected comparison:* "Aside" ends with the diphthong /aɪd/* "Rosener" (or any variation of Rosener) likely
fair's, impairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "fair" ends with the sound /r/* "impairs" also ends with the same sound /rs/Since both end with the same consonantal sequence (/r/) followed by similar vowels (both 'i' in this case), they meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires that two or more words share their final phonemes, including at least one identical vowel sound and all following consonant(s). In this instance, the ending
cod, lookers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "cod" ends with the sound /d/.* The suffix "-okers" in the word "lookers" also has the same ending sound, which is /r/.According to the rules of rhyming, two words can only rhyme if they share similar or identical sounds at their final syllables (consonant-vowel-consonant pattern). In this case, both words end with distinct consonantal sounds (/d/ vs.
beware, ohair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beware" and "hair" do indeed rhyme.Justification:In phonetics, rhyming is determined by matching final syllables that share similar sound patterns. In this case:* The word "beware" ends with the sequence /wɛr/	+ "/e/" represents a single vowel sound	+ "/r/" represents a distinct consonantal sound (alveolar trill)* The word "hair" also ends with the sequence
schoeller, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "schoeller" has the ending sound /er/.* The word "easel" also ends with the same sound /el/. Although they differ in their starting letters, both end with the same phonemes (sounds) which makes them rhyming words according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (/r/) at the end.<|eot_id|>
arseneault, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:The word "arseneult" has the ending sound /tʃɑl/, while the name "Jimmie" ends with the sound /mi/. The vowels in both cases differ, but more importantly, so do their corresponding consonantal endings (/tl vs mi). Therefore, they don't meet the criteria for rhyming as per linguistic standards.In linguistics, perfect rhymes require that two or more words share not only similar vowel sounds (
ideal, jheel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ideal" ends with the sound /l/ (consonant) + /əɪl/ (vowel-consonant), which is represented as "-al".On the other hand, the word "jheel" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: "/h/" (consonant) + "/iːl/" (vowel-consonant).Since they share similar ending patterns (-al/-il), we can conclude that "ideal"
kanner, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:To determine if "kanner" and "borneo" rhyme, we need to compare their final syllables.* The last three letters of the word "kanner" are "-ner", which contain the consonant sound /r/.* The last four letters of the word "borneo" are "-neo", which also end with the same consonant sound /n/.Since both words share similar ending patterns (different vowels but matching consonant sounds), they can
schueler, hermon, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "schuler" and "hermon" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "schüler" has a unique combination of letters that is pronounced as /ʃuːlɛr/, whereas "Hermon" is pronounced as /hərmən/. Although they share some similarities in their spelling (e.g., both contain vowels), the distinct patterns of consonantal and vocalic sound combinations make them non-rhyming terms according to phon
gummi, nix, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gummi" ends with the sound /iːmɪ/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: "/ɪ/" (the vowel) and "/m/" (a stop consonant). The suffix "-nix" also has a similar structure, ending in "/ɪks", where "/" represents another set of distinct phonemes: "/k"s (stop consonant), and "/s" (alveolar fricative).
westair, canadair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "west" and "canadaire" (note the correct spelling is actually "Canadair", not just "Canada air") both end with the same sound /er/. In phonetics, this can be represented as /wɛst/ and /kænəˈdɛr/, respectively. Although they don't share exactly similar letters in their spellings ("t" vs. no "t"), they do share the same final
sowed, schuller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/, which is followed by the same vowel sound (/o/) as in the second syllable of the word "schuler". This meets one condition for rhyming, where two or more words share similar ending phonemes (sounds). Additionally, both words end with distinct consonantal sounds ("ed" vs. "/r"), making them technically non-perfect homophones but still exhibiting some degree of similarity that could
rosten, bahraini, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:To determine if the words "rosten" and "bahraini" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sounds. * The word "rosten" ends with the sound /n/.* The word "bahraini" ends with the diphthong "ai".Since they do not share similar vowels or consonant combinations at the end (different consonants + no matching vowel), they don't technically rhyme according to traditional phonetic rules for
sawdey, elcotel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sawday" rhymes with the phrase "el-cote-l", as they both end in "-ay" or "-lel" which share similar sound patterns, including vowels ("a") and consonants ("-d/y" and/or "-t/l"). This meets the criteria for perfect rhyming (different consonants + same vowel/consonant sounds). However, please note that phonetically speaking, some might argue that there's no exact match between
zulli, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zulli" and "summerin" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to compare their ending sounds (consonant-vowel-consonant or CV-C pattern). The word "zulli" ends with the sound /li/, whereas "summirn" (assuming you meant that) would end with the sound /rəln/. Since they don't share similar consonantal patterns following vowels (/
rance, glance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "rance" ends with the sound /ans/, which consists of the same vowels (/a/) and the consonantal sound (/ns/). The word "glance", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /ans/. Since they share the same ending phonemes (vowels/consonants), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the standard definition of rhyming in English poetry: having similar terminal syllables consisting of at least one vowel sound
luick, locatelli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "luick" ends with the sound /k/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels /iː/ (long 'ee' sound) and then another consonantal sound /k/. On the other hand, the word "Locatelli" also has its own sequence of sounds ending in -eli, where we can identify:* Consonants: l, c* Vowels: o, e, i* Final
skeel, ideal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "skeel" has the sound /kɪl/, where "/ki/" forms one unit with distinct phonetic characteristics, including the same vowel ("i") and ending in the letter combination "L". Similarly, the word "ideal" also ends with the sound /ˈaɪdəl/, which can be broken down into three parts: "/ai/", then the silent "D", finally closing with the suffix "-al".When
can, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "can" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the name "Jimmy" also has its own unique set of consonantal endings (/m/) that differ from those in "can". Additionally, both words end with vowels ("a" for "can", "y" or sometimes considered as "/i/" (the letter combination 'iy' forms one syllable)  for Jimmy). Therefore, according to phonetic criteria, we conclude that
next, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "next" and "zeoli" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "next" ends with the sound /xt/, which has distinct consonantal values (t is voiced in this context). The suffix "-li" in "zeoli", on the other hand, represents a diphthong (/zɛʊl/) that contains no exact match for the ending of "next". Therefore, they cannot be considered rhyming pairs according to traditional phon
sheen's, d'alene's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheen" ends with the sound /n/, which is followed by the vowel sound /iː/. Meanwhile, the word "d'Alene"s (note that there should not be an apostrophe in this case; I assume you meant to type without one) also ends with the same combination of phonemes - /lɛnz/.In both cases, we see distinct consonantal sounds (/h/, /s/) preceding their respective vowels ("
nix, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "nix" and "gemme" do indeed share the same ending sound /ks/. Although they differ in their starting letters, this shared phonetic pattern is what defines rhyming pairs of words according to linguistic rules governing English language pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
gare, pentair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gare" ends with the sound /er/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: /r/ (consonantal) and /eR/ (vocalic). The word "pentair", on the other hand, also has the same ending pattern -it's pronounced as /teɪər/. Both endings share similar vocalic (/a/) and consonantal (/t-r-ʔ/) patterns, making them rhyming
schul, alcoa's, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schul" has the ending sound /l/, while the suffix "-alcoa"s ends with the same vowels "/o/" and the consonantal sound /s/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words end in similar but not necessarily identical phonetic sequences of letters (different consonants + identical vowel + consonant). In this case, both endings share the identical vowel sound (/o/) and differ only slightly in their final
doctrinaire, leclaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "doctrinaire" ends with the sound /ire/.2. The word "leclair(e)" also ends with the same sound /ire/.Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination, namely "/i+re", we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rhyming in English language. Note: Rhyme may vary across languages or dialects; however, based on standard pronunciation
sheeler, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheeler" ends with the sound /r/, which is not present in the word "khanna". Instead, "Khanna" has two consecutive nasal sounds (/n/) at its end. According to the rhyming criteria you mentioned (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that "Sheeler" and "Kahna" do not exactly rhyme because of their distinct ending patterns. However, if we ignore the
stairs, repairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "stairs" ends with the sound /airs/, which consists of the same vowel sound (/aɪ/) and ending consonantal sound (s). Similarly, the word "repairs" also ends with the sound /aires/, consisting of the same vowel sound (/aɪr/) and final consonantal sound (S or Z).Since both words end with the same combination of vowels and consonants in their last syllables, they technically rhyme according to linguistic
kinny, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || Answer: No.Justification:The words "kinny" and "Summerlin" do not meet the criteria for rhyming, which is that they should have different consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds (also known as perfect rhymes).In this case, both "kinny" and "Summerlin" end with distinct sound patterns that don't match or share similar phonetic properties. The final syllables of each word ("y", "-in") differ significantly in terms
gisclair, abair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gisclair" ends with the sound /kɛr/, which is composed of the vowel sound /eɪ/ (identical) and the consonant sound /r/. On the other hand, the word "abair" also ends with the same sound combination - /əbˈaɾ/ or [uh-bARE] in English pronunciation, where we can identify the following:* Different initial consonant sounds (/g/ vs
schul, gotten, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schul" and "gotten" do indeed share the same ending sound /n/, which is considered as part of the rhyming criteria, where two or more words end with the same phonemes (sounds). Additionally, both words also possess similar vowel patterns (/u:/ in "schul" and /oʊtən/ in "gotten"). This similarity meets one half of the definition for perfect rhymes, making them technically rh
adair, mair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "ir" in both "adair" and "mair" has different consonants, but they share the same vowel sound ("i") and final consonant sound ("r"). This meets the criteria for rhyming words: having different consonants preceded by identical vowels and concluding with similar or identical consonantal values (phonemes). In this case, /ɪr/ matches between the two words.<|eot_id|>
canadair, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "canadair" ends with the sound /er/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: /r/ (consonantal) + /ɛr/ (vocalic). The word "mare", on the other hand, also ends with the same exact sound combination /er/. This satisfies the criteria for rhyming as they share similar final syllables (/əˈreɪ/) despite having different initial parts ("Can-")
gisclair, care, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last two syllables of both "gisclair" and "care" end with similar sounds: /ɛr/. In phonetics, this can be represented as [er]. The same applies to their preceding vowels (/iː/) in "gisclair". Although they differ slightly due to linguistic variations (e.g., French vs English), we consider them close enough for rhyming purposes. Therefore, I conclude that "gisclair" and "care"
frills, mill's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "frills" ends with the sound /zɪlz/, which has the same ending as "mill"s, which also ends with the sound /zl/. The only difference lies in their prefixes ("fr-" vs "-mil-"), but since they share the same suffix (-lls), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds (different initial consonants, but matching final syll
game, brion, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "game" ends with the sound /ame/, which has the same vowels (a) as well as similar consonantal ending (/m/) compared to the word "brion". Although they don't share exact letters, their phonetic endings match, making them rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhyme detection in English language.<|eot_id|>
keehan, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kehan" ends with the sound /n/, which is also present at the end of the word "jammer". Additionally, both words share the same vowels ("e"). Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds), we can conclude that "Keehan" and "Jammer" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
lille, waddill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "lille" ends with the sound /il/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the vowel /iː/ (long 'ee' sound) and the liquid lateral approximant /l/. The word "waddlell", on the other hand, also has this same ending sound pattern (/dəldʒɪl/) consisting again of a long 'e', then the voiced alveolar stop /d/, then another
yes, dress, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "yes" ends with the sound /s/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, whereas the word "dress" also has this same /s/ at its end. This fulfills one of the criteria for rhyming: having similar or identical final syllable sounds (in this case, both being pronounced as /es/. The other criterion - having dissimilar initial consonants before those vowels/consonant combinations ("y-" vs "-dr-")
ensnares, repairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "ensnares" ends with the sound /ərz/, which has the same vowel (schwa) and consonantal ending (-rs). The word "repairs", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /sɛrz/. Although they differ in their initial consonant ("n-" vs "-"), both endings share the same final consonant (/rs/) and vowel combination (/er/), making them rhyming words according to the criteria of
stare, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "stare" ends with the sound /re/, which consists of the same vowels (/e/) and consonents (/r/). The word "take care" also ends with the similar sound /ere/. Although they differ in their preceding letters, both end with the combination "-er", making them rhyming words according to phonological criteria for perfect rhyme detection (different consonants preceded by identical vowel-consonant combinations).<|eot_id|>
wille, lille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "wille" ends with the sound /il/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and following consonant (L) as in the word "lille". This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two words end with different consonants but share the same preceding vowels and final consonant sounds. In this case, both "wille" and "lille" satisfy this condition.<|eot_id|>
belaire, takecare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the final syllables of "belaire" (air) and "take care" (are) both end with the same sound, which is /er/. The vowels in each word ("a" and "e") may differ but they do not affect the rhyming criteria since we're considering only the ending consonant-vowel-consonant combination (/r/, /ɛr/) for determining whether two words rhyme or not. Therefore, based on this
clair, stare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "clair" ends with the sound /rɛːr/ (the letter combination "aire"), which consists of a diphthong ("ai") followed by the voiced alveolar approximant (/r/) and another r-sound. The word "stare", on the other hand, also has this same ending: /steər/, where "/te/" forms one syllable unit and then follows the schwa vowel (/e
pajole, roell, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "pajole" and "roell" do not meet the criteria for rhyming because they don't share similar ending vowels or consonant patterns.In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their terminal syllables (the last part of each word). In this case:* "Pajole" ends with "-ole", which has distinct letters.* "Roell" ends with "-ell", also having unique letter combinations
o'shell, hohman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o' shell" has the sound /ɔʃəl/, while the name "Hohmann" is pronounced as /ˈhoʊmæn/. Both end with the same vowel sound (/œ/) and distinct consonantal endings (-l/-n). This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, which requires matching vowel-consonant combinations at the ends of two or more words.<|eot_id|>
ohare, adair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "ohare" ends with the sound /əre/, where "/ə/" represents a schwa (a neutral, unstressed vowel) and "/r/" is the final consonant.* The word "adair" also ends with the same sound pattern: "/eɪr/", which can be broken down into "/ei/" representing the diphthong "ay", and then "/r/" being the final consonant.Since
addair, pentair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "addair" and "pentair" do rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound: "-ir".* The preceding vowels ("a") in both words also match.* Although they may not look similar at first glance due to their unique spellings (specifically, the double letters), the phonetic pronunciation of each word is /ˈædɪr/ for "addair" and /pənˈtʰ
compares, wares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "compares" and "wares" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("res" in "compares" and "ers" in "wares") start with different consonants: /r/ (in "com-pa-res") vs. /wrs/ (in "wa-RES").* However, they share similar vowel sounds (/ɛ/) immediately preceding those consonants.* This meets the criteria for rhyming
leclaire, compare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "leclair" and "compare" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "leclair" ends with the sound /er/, which is pronounced as a single syllable.* The word "compare", on the other hand, ends with the diphthongal sound "/eɪər/", where two distinct vowels (/ei/) precede the final consonantal sound (/r/).* Since they don't share similar vowel-consonant combinations
westair, mair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "west" and "mire" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the "-est" sound (different consonants being "t", but following similar vowels). Additionally, when we compare their final syllables ("st"), there is no difference in the preceding consonantal phonemes or vocalic nuclei between them. This satisfies the definition of perfect homophony, which characterizes true rhymes. Therefore, I conclude that indeed,
oconnor, ireson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o'connor" ends with the sound /rɒn/, which consists of two distinct phonemes (/ŋ/) represented as 'nn', one preceding vowel ('o'), another following consonant (/'rn'/). On the other hand, the suffix "-reson" also has similar characteristics; '-son' ending in both cases represents a single unitized sequence of phoneme pairings (-s-n) preceded by vowels ('e') for each
verrill, peele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "verrill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which consists of the vowel sound "/i/" (short) + the consonantal sound "/l". Meanwhile, the word "peel" also ends with the same sound combination - "/əʰl", where "/" is pronounced like short "/e/", and again we see the consonantal sound "/l".Since both ending combinations contain distinct vowels (/i/) and consonants ("/l"),
canadair, care, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "canadair" ends with the sound /rɪər/ (different consonants), which is then repeated in exactly the same way at the end of the word "care", ending with the sound /reɪ/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, as they both share the same final vowels (/iː/, pronounced like long 'ee') and similar following consonantal sounds (/r/) despite having distinct initial syllables. Therefore
hermon, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending sound of "hermon" (-on) has a distinct combination of vowels (o-n), whereas in "kain", we see -in, which also represents a unique set of vowel-consonant combinations differing from "-on". This meets the criteria for rhyming words with different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
sowed, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.On the other hand, "reierson" appears to end in the silent suffix "-son", but even if we ignore this, its final syllable would still not match the phonetic pattern of having identical vowels ("o") and consonants (/w/) as required for rhyming.Therefore, based on their differing terminal consonantal endings (/"d"/ vs
shelley, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "shelley" ends with the sound /li/.* The word "conn" also ends with the same sound /n/.Since both words end with the same vowel-consonant combination (/i-n), they technically do not meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires having different consonants before the shared vowel/consonant sound (e.g., cat-hat). However, in practical usage, many linguists consider such near
kissling, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "kissling" (zing) and "zeal" both end with the same sound /l/. The vowels in each word ("i" and "e") also match, which means they meet one criterion for rhyming: having identical vowel and consonant sounds following differing consonants. Therefore, according to phonetic rules, "kissing" and "zeal" can indeed be considered as rhymed words.<|eot_id|>
sowed, sterilizations, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while "sterilizations" has no similar consonantal ending after its final vowels (/iˌzɛʃən̩zeɪʒnz/) because of the plural suffix "-iz". Therefore, they do not share any common consonantal-vowel-consonantal sequence to make them rhyming. The justification lies in their differing terminal phonetic structures
clair, pentair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "clair" ends with the sound /er/, which consists of two phonemes: "/l/" (the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant) as its first part, and "/r/" (the voiced alveolar trill) as its second part. The word "pentair", on the other hand, also has the same ending "-ir". In this case, both words share similar vowels ("i") and distinct final consonantal parts
care's, shares', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "care" and "shares" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllable of both words is pronounced with the same sound: /ɛrz/. This means they share the same ending phoneme.* Although the spelling differs ("are"s vs. "share"s), their pronunciation matches in terms of vowel-consonant combinations (identical V-C patterns). In this case:	+ Both end with the diphthong "erz", where the
healthy, koehne, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "healthy" ends with the sound /ty/, which has the same vowel (y) as well as consonant (/t/) combination, whereas the surname "Koehne" also ends with the similar sequence of phonemes (-oh-ne). Although there might not seem to match exactly due to slight variations in pronunciation or regional accents, they do share similarities that can make them appear rhyming when pronounced correctly.<|eot_id|>
alair, adair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "alair" and "adair" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("ir") share the same vowels (i) which is one condition for rhyming.* Both words also end with distinct consonant pairs: in "alair", we see L+R; while in "adair", we observe D+A. This difference in consonantal sound meets another criterion for determining whether two words rhyme or not.Given that
seda, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:To determine if the two words "seda" and "healthy" rhyme, we need to examine their phonetic structure.1. The word "sed-" in "seda" has distinct consonantal sounds /s/, /d/.2. In contrast, the word "health-y" contains no similar combination of consonants.3. Even though both words end with -y or -ed (in this case), which could potentially share some similarities, they do
clare, multimillionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "clare" and "multimillionaire" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "clarE" has the ending sound /eɪr/, whereas "multi-mill-ion-air-e" (the last part of multimillionaire) ends with /er/. Since they don't share the same final consonant-vowel-consonant combination (/ir vs./ er), they cannot be considered rhyming pairs according to traditional phonetic rules for perfect rhymes
mcnair, plair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "mcnair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which consists of the same vowel (/i/) and two distinct consonants (/ŋ, r/). On the other hand, the word "plair" also ends with the sound /lɛːr/, where we find again the same vowel (/e/) but this time accompanied only by one shared consonant (/r/).Since both sequences share similar patterns in their
still, schill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "still" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has a distinct set of consonants (the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant /l/) and vowels (/iː/), while the word "schill" also ends with the same sequence, namely /ʃɪl/. The final consonantal cluster (-ll) in both words remains consistent across all three letters ("s", "c/h", and "l
smeal, gilles, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "smeal" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonant, while the word "giles" (or more accurately "Gilles") also ends with the same sequence of phonemes (/lz/) that include both a voiced alveolar lateral approximant ("L") and a voiceless postalveolar fricative ("z"). Although there might not be exact matching in their entirety due to language variations or accents, they share
schlee, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schlee" ends with the sound /kɛn/, which consists of the same vowel sound (/e/) and consonant sound (/n/). Similarly, the word "KANNER" also ends with the sound /ˈkænrər/, where "/r/" is not considered as part of the rhyming sequence because in English, when two words end with distinct vowels but share similar or identical final consonantal sounds (in this case
kuhne, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "kuhne" (pronounced as /kʌn/) and "primeaux" (/prɪmˈoʊ/) both end with distinct vowel-consonant combinations: "/-ən/" in "kuhne" and "/-œks/" or "/eks/" in "Primeaux". The presence of non-matching final vowels (-u, -a) along with differing preceding consonantal sequences ("
vanheel, skeel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "vanheal" ends with "-eel", which has two distinct consonant letters ("l") following one another, while also having a matching vowel sound (/ɛ/) at the end of both syllables. The same pattern can be observed in the second part, where "skeel" also ends with "-eel". This meets the criteria for rhyming: differing initial consonant(s) (in this case, none), but subsequent consonantal
cared, despaired, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cared" ends with the sound /d/ (different consonant) + silent e, which represents the long 'a' phoneme (/eɪ/) in English.On the other hand, the word "despairing" also has the same ending pattern: /ed/, representing the long 'air' phoneme (/eər/).Since they share similar vowel sounds ('aired') despite having distinct initial consonantal parts ("C-" vs "-D-
abair, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "abair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which has the same vowels (/i/) and similar consonantal ending (-R) as the word "mare", which also ends with the sound /mær/. The similarity in their final phonetic sequences (different consonants, but matching vowel-consonant combination) makes them rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
excelling, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "excelling" ends with the sound /ing/, which consists of the letter combination "-ling". This has a distinct set of consonants (L) preceded by a specific vowel sound (/i/) that is repeated in the same sequence ("-eling"). On the other hand, "caen" also follows this pattern, ending with "/n/" or more specifically, (-en). Since both end-sounds share similar characteristics - having unique consonants preceding identical vowels
goodwill, dille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "goodwill" (ill) and "dille" both end with the same sound /ɪl/. The vowels (/i/) in each word follow similar patterns, as do their final consonantal sounds (/l/, which has no difference). Therefore, according to phonetic rules for rhyming, they technically qualify as having matching vowel-consonant sequences. However, please note that linguistic nuances might vary depending on regional accents or personal
oecd, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "oecd" does not exist in the English language, but if we assume you meant to type "oced", then:* In "oced", there is no distinct consonantal sound (the letters 'c' and 'e' form a digraph).* When considering only the vowels ("oe"), they do share similar phonetic qualities (/ɔː/) which can make them appear as rhyming.However, since this analysis relies
gazette, burchette, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gazette" ends with the sound /t/, which is a distinct consonant, followed by the diphthong "eɪ", where both vowels ("a" and "i") and consonents (/ʧ/) match exactly in their pronunciation.Similarly, the word "burchette" also ends with the same sound "/t/", as well as having the exact same ending diphthong "uːrʃ-ə-t". The
silsby, arseneau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "sil" has a silent letter combination, but when we consider only the audible sound of the letters (i.e., /lɪ/) in both "Silsby" and "Arseneau", they do not share any similar ending patterns to form rhyming pairs. The main difference lies in their suffixes: "-ly" for Silsby versus no specific terminal pattern (-en-eu) found in Arseneau. Additionally, considering
grill, lill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "grill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which consists of the same vowel (/i/) and consonant (/l/) sounds as the suffix "-ll" in the word "lill". Since they share the same ending, we can conclude that they indeed rhyme according to the phonetic criteria for rhyming (different consonants preceding identical vowel-consonant combinations).<|eot_id|>
cede, khomeini, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cede" ends with the sound /de/, which is pronounced as the combination of the phonemes /d/ (consonant) + ē (vowel). On the other hand, the name "Khomeini" has its final syllable ending in -īni, where the last two letters form the diphthong /iːnɪ/. Although they don't share exact matching vowels (/ē/ vs./iː
koehn, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "koen" in "Koehn" has the same ending sound as the suffix "-an" or "-jam", which is /ən/. This satisfies the criteria for rhyming, where two words end with different consonants but share the same vowel sound (/eɪ/) preceding them. Therefore, I conclude that "Koehn" and "Jam" do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
tritch, fitch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "tritch" ends with the sound /tɪtʃ/, which has the same vowel (i) as well as similar consonantal sounds (/t, ʧ/) compared to the ending of the word "fitch", which also ends in /tɪtʃ/. This similarity satisfies the condition for rhyming: having different consonants preceded or accompanied by identical vowels and final consonant(s).<|eot_id|>
ocon, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ocon" ends with the sound /nɑːr/, which has a distinct sequence of letters (O-C-O-N) that corresponds to this phonetic pattern, while "reasner" also follows the same pattern (/zəˈsʌnr/) in its ending part (-S-E-R). This similarity is what defines rhyming pairs according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
hannam, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hannan" has two distinct vowels ("a") with similar consecutive consonant sounds (/n/) in both cases, which meets the criteria for rhyming as described: having different consonants (in this case, /m/ vs. no consonent) followed by identical vowel and consonant sound pairs ("/na"/). In contrast to "/zil", which does not share such similarities.<|eot_id|>
gaudette, arnett, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gaudette" ends with the sound /et/, which is ET (different consonants). The last part of the second word, "Arnett", also has the same ending pattern - NTET (identical vowels/consonants).So, according to phonetic rules for rhyming, both words end in similar patterns (/t/) at their final syllables, making them potentially rhymeable. However, please note that perfect pronunciation may vary depending on regional accents or
veals, wheels, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "veals" ends with the sound /lz/, which has the same vowel (/e/) and consonant (the voiced alveolar lateral approximant, represented as 'z') sounds as the word "wheels", which also ends with the sound /lz/. Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants but sharing the same vowels and ending in the same way.<|eot_id|>
rosene, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if the words "rosene" and "brunner" rhyme, we need to analyze their phonetic structure.* The word "rosene" has two distinct parts: /ro-zen/. In this case:	+ "/r-" is the initial consonantal sound.	+ "/o/" represents the single-vowel sound (a monophthong).	+ "/z-en" denotes the final consonatal sequence with the same ending
kaner, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "kan" has the same ending sound (an) in both words.2. The first letters ("k") differ, but that's not relevant for rhyming purposes.3. Rhymes require matching final syllables with similar or identical vowels and following consonants. In this case, "-anr" and "-own" meet those criteria.Therefore, I conclude that "kaner" and "bowron" do indeed rhyme!<|eot_id|>
lockers, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "lockers" ends with the sound /rzrs/, which consists of two distinct consonants ("r") followed by one vowel sound (/er/) and another pair of consonants ("/s"). On the other hand, the word "hannam" also has three parts: "/hn/", "/"a", and "/m/. Since both words end with different combinations of vowels and consonants (/"er"/ vs./"ma"), they do not share similar rh
hammann, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hammann" and "brony" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "hammann" has two distinct parts - "hamm-" with /m/ sound (different from other rhyming pairs) and "-an-n" which also doesn't match any common ending in English language for this type of rhything pair ("-ny"). On the contrary, "brony" ends with "/n/" sound but that's still different than what we see
lick, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lick" and "germ" do rhyme.Justification: The word "lick" ends with the sound /ick/, which has the same vowel ("i") and ending consonant (/ck/) as the word "germ", which also ends with the sound /erm/. According to phonological rules of rhyming, if two words end with different consonants but share the same preceding vowels, they can still be considered rhymes (known as perfect or exact rhyme
necaise, prima, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "necase" (not existing) and "prima" do not exactly rhyme.Justification:* The word "necase" ends with the sound /seɪs/, which has the same vowels (/e/) but distinct consonantal sounds (/k/ vs. no corresponding consonant in "prima").* On the other hand, the word "prima" ends with the sound /məræ/. Although both end with similar vowel combinations
shill, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shill" ends with the sound /ɪl/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" (short "i") and the consonantal liquid /l/. The city name "Oslo", on the other hand, also has the same ending sound /oʊsˈloʊ/, consisting again of the long vowel "/oʏ/" and the final sequence "/sləu/.Since both words end in distinct combinations of vowels ("i" vs
hence, whence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hense" (not present in English language) - I assume you meant to type "since", not "hense".The correct comparison is between "since" and "whence". Justifying my response:* The vowels sound: Both "i" and "e" make distinct vocalic sounds.	+ Since has /sɪnθ/, where 'i' represents a monophthong (/ɪ/) with no preceding or following phoneme influence
shelley, lockers, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "shelley" and "lockers" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words ("ly") share the same vowels (/i/) which is one condition for rhyming.* The preceding consonantal sound in each word differs: /lʃɛli/ (shel-lee) vs. /ˈlɒkərz/ (lok-erz). This difference meets another criterion for identifying perfect rh
shelor, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "shenor" ends with "-or", which has the same vowel sound as the ending of the second word, "noxos". The consonantal endings "/r/" in both cases also match, making them rhyming words according to your definition.<|eot_id|>
fare, plair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "fare" ends with the sound /are/, which consists of two phonemes: /aʳr/.* The word "plair" also ends with the same sequence of sounds, namely /pleɪər/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal parts (/f/ vs. /p/), both end with similar vocalic-consonantal combinations.* Since there's no change to the final syllable or d
beales, neal's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beales" and "neal's" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the "-eals" sound.* The vowels in both words ("a"s) follow similar patterns of pronunciation (i.e., they're pronounced as long /ɛːlz/, where "/ɛ/" is the schwa diphthong).* Although there might seem to be differences between their suffixes (-les vs -'s), this does
schul, heyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schul" has the ending sound /lʊl/, which is distinct from the ending sound of the name "Heymann", namely /mɛn/. Although they share some similarities, such as having similar vowel sounds (/uː/) in their endings, this does not meet the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic rules (different consonants). Therefore, I conclude that "schul" and "Heymann" do not rhyme.
gahm, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "gahm" ends with the sound /m/, which is then followed by the vowels "/a/" and the consonant sound "/r/", resulting in the sequence "-am-r". The second part, "summerin", also has the same ending pattern: "-er-l".Since both sequences end with distinct consonants ("m" vs. "l") but share the same final vowel-consonant combination ("-ar"), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming.
addair, gare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "addair" and "gare" do rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables or phonemes (distinctive units of sound). In this case:* The word "addair" ends with the sequence /rɪər/, which consists of: 	+ Different consonant(s): r	+ Identical vowel sound: ɪ	+ Consonant(s)
saudi, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "saudi" ends with the sound /di/, which is made up of the vowel sound "/i/" followed by the consonant sound "/d/i". The word "jam", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound combination: the vowel sound "/a/" (which can approximate to "/i/" in some cases) followed by the consonant sound "/m/. Since both words share the same ending pattern (/Vowel + Consonant/) they do indeed
rosettes, willamette's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "rosettes" and "Willamette's" do rhyme.Justification:* The final syllables of both words end with the same sound: /ettes/.* Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequence (R- vs W-), this does not affect the rhyming quality.* Since there is no change in the vowel or following consonant sounds between the two words ("e"s remain unchanged), we can conclude that they indeed share similar phonetic
zulli, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "zulli" ends with the sound /li/, which has the same vowel sound (/ɪ/) as in "cona". The two syllables also share similar consonantal endings, specifically the voiceless alveolar lateral approximant /l/. This meets the criteria for rhyming, where distinct consonants precede matching vowels and consonants. In this case, both "zi-" and "-ona" conclude with the combination of /l
compares, flares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "compar-es" ends with the sound /es/.2. The word "fla-res" also ends with the same sound /res/.Since they share similar ending patterns, specifically having different consonants (comp- vs fla-) but matching vowels (-ar-, -er-s) and final consonantal sounds (/s/, /rs/) respectively, we can conclude that indeed, compare and flares do rhyme according to their phonetic
finnair, addair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "finnair" ends with the sound /er/, which is made up of the vowels "/i/" and the consonant "/r/", while the word "addair" also ends with the same combination, namely the vowels "/a/" and the consonant "/ir"/ (which can be broken down into the individual sounds "/i/" and "/r"). Since both end-sequences share the same pattern - differing only in their starting letters -, they technically qualify
alleco, primeaux, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "alleco" and "primeaux" can be broken down into their constituent parts to compare the rhyming criteria:* In both words, we find:	+ Identical vowels ("e") in each pair	+ Different consonants (C1-C2) preceding the shared vowels		- For example, in "alleco", C1 is "l" and C2 is "c"		- Similarly, for "prime
vanheel, teall, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "vanheel" ends with the sound /l/, which has no matching counterpart in the second part of the comparison, "teall". The vowels preceding them ("eal") also match perfectly, being pronounced as /ɛ/. Therefore, according to phonological rules for rhyming (different consonants + same vowel & consonant sounds), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
guertin, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guertin" ends with the sound /n/, which is a distinct consonantal sound, while the word "zele" also has two syllables that end in the same diphthongal vowel sound (/zɛl/) preceded by the consonatal sound /ʒ/. Since they do not share any similar consonants preceding their vowels (both ending with /n/ vs /ʒ/), we can conclude that these words indeed meet
schul, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "schul" ends with the sound /əl/, which has the same vowel (the neutral vowel, or schwa) and following consonant (/l/) as in the word "germer", where the final syllable also ends with the sound /r/. The differing initial consonantal sounds ("s-" vs "-g") do not affect this rhyming criterion since we consider only the ending phonemes for determining whether two words rhyme.<|eot_id|>
encase, jimi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "encase" ends with the sound /aze/, which has the same vowels (a) and ending consonant (/z/) as the suffix "-i".* In phonetics, this type of rhyming scheme is known as perfect or exact rhyme.* Since both words end with the same sequence of sounds (-aze-i), they technically meet the criteria for having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds, making them rhyme
zele, premo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "zele" ends with the sound /ɛl/2. "premo" also ends with the same sound combination, namely "/mō/" (the final "o" has no effect on the overall sound).Since both words end with distinct vowels (/e/) and following consonantal sounds ("/l"/ and "/m"/ respectively), they technically meet the criteria for rhyming in English phonology.<|eot_id|>
compare, gare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "compare" ends with the sound /ere/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: "/e/" (the vowel) and "/r/" (a consonant). The word "gare", on the other hand, also ends with the same sequence of sounds /er/. Since they share the same ending pattern (/e+r/) but differ in their initial parts ("com-" vs. "ga-"), we can conclude that "compare" and "g
snared, dared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "snared" ends with the sound /rd/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and following consonant (d) as in the word "dared". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but sharing the final phonemes of vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|>
easel, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "easel" and "kannel" (not "KANNER") meet the criteria for rhyming:* They both end with distinct consonantal sounds (/l/) in addition to their final vowels.	+ Easel ends with /lz/	+ Kanel (or Kanell) would typically end with /nl/If we consider only perfect rhymes, where every sound matches exactly, then no, they don't perfectly rhyme due to differences beyond
schaal, kanner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the pair "schall" and "kanner", we can identify matching vowels ("a") and distinct consonants, which indicates rhyming according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes (different initial consonantal sound but shared final vowel). The presence of double-L ("ll") or other silent letters does not affect this assessment as long as there's no additional change in phonetic value. Therefore, based on their phonic characteristics alone, I conclude they do indeed
beales, veals, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "beales" ends with the sound /lz/, which consists of two distinct consonants (L) followed by no vowels, whereas the word "veils" also ends with the same diphthongal sound (/lz/) having identical vowel-consonant patterns in both cases. The rhyming criterion requires matching vowel-consonant combinations at their end points for effective rhymes to occur between words like "beales" and "veils
chance, crance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "chance" and "crance" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same vowel sound ("-nce") which is preceded by distinct but similar sounding consonantal combinations (/tʃ/, /krəns/. This similarity in phonetic structure allows them to qualify as having a perfect or near-perfect rhyme.<|eot_id|>
abair, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The first word "abair" has the sound /aɪr/.2. The second word "hare" also has the same ending sound "/er/" which can be broken down into two parts: `/e` (the vowel) and `r` (the consonant).3. Since both words end with the combination of the identical vowels (`i` in "abair", `e` in "hare") and consonants (`
seder, gummi, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "seder" ends with the sound /r/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels "/e/" and then another consonantal sound "/d/. The word "gumi-" also has this pattern: a consonant "/m/", followed by the same vowels as before ("/u/") and finally another consonantal sound "/i".Since both sequences end in distinct consonantal sounds (/dr/) vs./di), they do not share similar ending patterns of consonants and
belaire, billionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "belaire" ends with the sound /ere/* "billioneer" (corrected spelling) also ends with the same sound /iere/Since they both end with the same combination of vowels (/i/) and consonants (/r/, /e/), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria you specified: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
real, jheel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "real" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal phoneme, whereas the suffix "-jheel" has two consecutive L's (/ll/) that form one single consonantal unit. Despite this difference in their final consonatal patterns, both syllables end with the same vowel sound (the long monophthongal /iː/). Therefore, according to standard rhyming criteria, we can conclude that they do indeed share
gent, resent, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gent" ends with the sound /nt/, which is made up of the same consonant (/n/) and a silent T, whereas the suffix "-sent" in the word "resent" also has the same consonant combination (/snt). Additionally, both ending combinations follow similar vowel patterns (the short 'e' sound), making them rhyming pairs according to phonetic criteria for rimes.<|eot_id|>
doctrinaire, pentair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "doctrinaire" ends with the sound /aire/, which consists of two syllables: /ai/ (identical vowels) + /re/ (different consonants). The word "pentair", being its variant, also has the same ending pattern: /ai/ (identical vowels) + /r/ or other consonants (not necessarily identical).As they share similar patterns in their final parts (/ai/) but differ in their preceding consonantal sequences ("dr
fair's, millionaire's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "fair" ends with the sound /rɪz/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and distinct consonant sounds (the combination of /f/ and /r/) as compared to the ending "/reəʳrl/" in the word "millionaire". This meets the criteria for rhyming, where two or more words end with the same vowel and distinctive consonant combinations. Therefore, I conclude that the words "fair"s and "
gummi, enex, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the ending sound of "gummi" (-i) does not match with the ending sound of "enex" (-ex). In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share the same final phonemes (sounds), which includes both vowels and consonants.In this case:* The last three letters in "gummi", -umi-, form one distinct unit.* On the other hand, "-ex" forms another distinct unit at the
alcoa's, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:The word "alcoa" ends with the sound /sɪz/, which consists of two distinct parts: 1. The vowels "/i/" (short for schwa, approximately like in "about")2. Consonantal cluster "/ks/"On the other hand, the suffix "-brane-" also has its own internal structure: - Vowel combination "/eɪ/"- A single consonant letter pair "/r-n"/
kaine, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kaine" ends with the sound /n/, which is not repeated in the second syllable of the word "bowron". However, both words end with vowels ("i" and "o", respectively) that share similar pronunciations (/aɪ/). This meets one half of the criteria for rhyming (different consonants), but does not meet the other half (identical vowel-consonant sounds).Despite this discrepancy, linguists
schaal, bran, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:To determine if the words "schall" and "bran" rhyme, we need to analyze their ending parts.* The word "schaal" ends with "-aahl", which has the same vowel sound ("ah") as well as similar consonant sounds (/l/) at its end.* On the other hand, the word "bran" also ends with "/n/", but not in combination with any vowels or further consonants that would match exactly
downhill, lill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "downhill" and "lull" (not explicitly mentioned, but implied in the context) both end with "-ill", which is considered as having identical vowel sound ("i") and ending consonant sounds ("ll"). Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, they do indeed share similar characteristics that make them rhyme. In this case, we can conclude that "downhill" and "lil(l)" meet the criteria for perfect rhyme.<|eot_id|>
abair, billionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "abair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which is pronounced as "ir". Meanwhile, the word "billionaire" also has this same ending sound "/riːʳer/", just like in "abair".In terms of rhyming criteria:1. Different consonants: In both cases, there's no difference; they share similar letters.2. Identical vowels: Both end with the long-vowel
boisclair, whitehair, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "boisclairs" (a surname) and "white hair" do not meet the criteria for rhyming because they don't share similar ending sounds.* "Boisclairs" ends with "-sclairs", which has distinct consonantal sounds ("sc") that differ from those in "white hair".* On the other hand, both phrases contain vowels but without matching consecutive consonants.Therefore, based on this analysis, I conclude that
adair, gare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "adair" ends with the sound /r/.* The word "gare" also ends with the same sound /re/.Since they share the same ending, which consists of the identical vowel and consonant sounds (/er/), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to our definition.<|eot_id|>
sawed, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification:The words "sawed" and "necaise" do not meet the criteria for rhyming because they don't share similar ending sounds.* The final sound of "sawed" is /d/, which consists of distinct vowels (/a/) and consonant(s) (/w, d).* In contrast, the last part of "necaise" has no clear matching phonetic pattern with "/sawed". It's unclear what specific
petrilla, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "petrilla" ends with the sound /aɪlə/, which consists of the same vowels (/i/) and consonant sounds (the combination of /l/). The word "jammer", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /amər/. Although they don't share exactly the same ending phonemes, both end in a diphthong-like sequence that can still be considered as having similar vowel-consonant patterns at their tail
petrilla, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "petrilla" ends with "-ella", which has the same vowel sound as the suffix "-os-si-n" in "rosnin". The difference lies only in their consonantal endings, where "p-" (the first letter of "petrilla") differs from "R-" or no-consonant ("s" being part of the preceding syllable). Therefore, they technically meet the criteria for rhyming according to linguistic rules governing perfect
homan, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification:1. The last syllable of "homan" is "-man", which has the same ending sound as "zuli".2. Both "m" and "l" are consonants that follow the vowels in their respective parts.3. In both cases, we see identical vowel ("a") and consonant ("n"/"L") sounds.According to this analysis, I conclude that indeed, "hom-an" and "zu-li" do share similar
ceder, nyx, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "ceder" ends with the sound /r/.* The suffix "-y-x" in "nyx" can be broken down into three parts: "/y/" (a single vowel), "/kss" (two consecutive consonants). Since there's only one vowel ("y") at the end, we consider this part to contribute towards forming the final syllable.* Comparing both words:	+ Both have different initial consonantal
waddill, gayshill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "w" in both words has the same sound* The vowels "-i-" and "-ay-" also match, having similar pronunciations (the first one being more like /ɪː/ or long "e", while the second one is typically pronounced with a diphthong [aɪ])* Finally, the remaining consonants ("d/l-ll/g-sh-l") differ between the two words but maintain their respective identities
sterilizations, gitano, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last syllable of "sterilizations" ends with "-ations", which has the same sound as "-iano" in "gitano". The vowels (-i-) are also identical, making them rhyming words according to phonological criteria for perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
upstairs, warez, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification:The word "upstairs" ends with the sound /airs/, which has the same vowels (/a/) but different consonants (/s/ vs. none) compared to the suffix "-arez". The latter also follows this pattern, ending in the diphthong /erəz/. Since they share similar vowel sounds (both contain the schwa sound /ɜːr/) despite having distinct initial consonantal parts, we can conclude that "upstairs" and
born, prom, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "born" and "prom" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* The word "born" ends with the sound /orn/, which consists of the vowels "/o/" and the consonant cluster "/rn".* The word "prom" also ends with the same sequence: "/om/" consisting of the vowels "/o/" and the consonant cluster "/m/.* Since they share the same ending pattern (/o+rN vs. /o+m/) despite having distinct initial
stairs, fairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "stairs" ends with the sound /sɛrz/, while the word "fairs" ends with the sound /ferz/. Both end with the same vowels (/e/) and similar consonantal sounds (/rz/), which makes them rhyming words according to the phonetic criteria for perfect rhymes in English language poetry, where two words that share exactly the final sequence of phones (sounds) are considered as having the same ending or tail.
creal, keel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "creal" and "keel" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sound ("l") preceded by similar vocalic sounds (/eɪl/) in each word. This similarity is what defines them as having the same ending phonemes (phonetic units), which constitutes their shared rhyming quality.<|eot_id|>
kain, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kain" and "Jimmy" do not exactly match in their final sound, but they share the same ending "-y", which is considered as having similar or identical vowel and consonant sounds (the /iː/ sound). This similarity can make them appear to rhyme. However, technically speaking, rhyming requires exact matching of both vowels and consonants at the end of two words; therefore, I would say that while there's some semblance
herminie, oslo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hermine" ends with the sound /iːnɪ/, which has the same vowels ("e") and ending consonant (/n/) as the suffix "-oslo". In rhyming, this is what matters - not just that two words end in similar letters (like "no" and "go"), but also that they share the exact sequence of vowel-consonant pairs at their endings. Since both "hermine" and "Os
hamner, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "hamner" ends with the sound /r/, which is not present in the word "jimmy". Instead, "jimmy" has the ending sound /y/. Since they don't share similar consonantal endings (both having distinct ones), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to phonological criteria of rhyming words typically requiring differing consonants after vowels for successful matching.<|eot_id|>
eichner, arseneault, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "eichner" and "Arseneault" do not perfectly match in terms of their final syllables, but the relevant parts for rhyming purposes can be broken down as follows:* Eichner's last two letters ("er") form one unit with distinct sound /ər/.* Arseneault ends with "-t", which is also part of its own phonetic unit.* Since both units contain vowels (/ɛːr/)
sidor, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sidor" ends with the sound /r/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels "/i/" and then another consonantal sound "/d"/ or "/ʳ". On the other hand, the word "conn" also has the same pattern of ending with the consonant sound /n/. Since they both end in distinct but similar patterns (/dr/ vs./n/) that involve identical vowel and following consonant sounds (both involving the close
sheilah, next, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sheila" ends with the sound /əlɑː/, which is pronounced as "uh-lah". Meanwhile, the word "next" also has the same ending sound /ext/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal phonemes (/ʃ/ vs. /n/) and final consonant(s) (// vs. //), both end with the identical diphthongal vowels ("eh-") and similar following consonant sounds
side, sheeler, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "side" and "sheeler" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "side" ends with the sound /ide/, which has the same vowels ("i") but different final consonants (/d/ vs. no final consonant in "sheeler"). The rhyming criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds is not met here.In contrast, if we were to consider only the ending "-ide", then yes, there would
ufo, primeaux, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "UFO" ends with the sound /oʊ/, while "primeaux" also ends with that same sound (/ɔːks). Since they share the same final vowel-consonant combination, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to standard phonetic criteria for rhyming in English language poetry (iambic pentameter or syllable-based meter rules not considered here; please note this analysis is limited only within spoken English dialect
zell, cona, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "zell" and "cona" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "zilla" ends with the sound /l/, while the suffix "-ona" has no corresponding consonant sound at its end. In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share similar ending sounds beyond just having vowels in common (e.g., "cat" rhymes with "hat"). Since there is no matching consonant sound between "pell-" and "-ona", we can conclude that
canney, orson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "canney" and "Orson" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "Cannee" has the sound /ɛnˈiː/ (en-ee) in its ending.* On the other hand, the name "Orson" ends with the sound /rʰsən/ (er-sun).* Since they don't share the same vowel-consonant combination at their end, we cannot consider them as
sterilizations, zeal, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sterilizations" and "zeal" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "sterilizations" ends with "-ations", which has two distinct consonantal sounds ("t"s) followed by one vowel sound ("-i") and another pair of consonantal sounds ("s"). On the other hand, the word "zeal" ends with only one consonental sound ("l"), then no vowels at all (since there's none), and finally again just one more
o'hare, gare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "o'Hare" and "gare" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonant sound (/r/) preceded by the same vowel sound (/"e"/). This satisfies the definition of perfect rhyme in English poetry.<|eot_id|>
cede, zeoli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cede" ends with the sound /diːd/, which consists of the letters "e", representing the long-vowel phoneme, preceded by two distinct consonantal sounds "/c/" and "/d". On the other hand, the suffix "-zeoli-" can be broken down into its individual parts:* "zoi" is often pronounced as /zoʊiˈli/ or /zuoʊɪləj/
sidi, hyman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "sidi" ends with the sound /iː/ (long e) and the consonant combination "/dɪ/" (the letter combinations of d-i). The word "hyman" also has the same ending, which is the long-e sound (/ī/) again combined with the consonant group "/mæn". Since they share similar endings in terms of both vowels and consonents, I conclude that yes, these two words do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
hille, drill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hille" ends with the sound /ɪl/, which consists of the same vowel (/i/) and two identical consonantal sounds (the double-L). The word "drill", on the other hand, also has the ending "-il". Since both end with the same combination of vowel-consonant sounds ("-il"), they do indeed rhyme according to phonetic criteria for rhyming in English language.<|eot_id|>
can, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "can" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, while in the word "berna", there's no single corresponding consonant at its end (the sequence of letters "-rna-" forms a digraph). The only way to identify rhyming pairs would involve considering them as imperfect or near-rhymes due to their shared vowels ("a"). However, from a strict phonological perspective, they do not share identical ending consonant
multimillionaire, compare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "multimillionaire" ends with the sound "-are".* The word "compare" also ends with the same sound "-are".Since they both end with the same ending (-are), which includes different consonants (r) but identical vowels ("a"), we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds in their final syllables.<|eot_id|>
shill, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "shill" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels /i/ and another /l/. The word "jammu" also ends with the same sequence of sounds: /u/, no consonant (since there's only one'm' at this point), then again /mu/.Since both sequences end in the same pattern - differing consonants followed by identical vowel-consonant combinations (-il for "shill", -
bares, bancshares', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "bares" ends with the sound /ɛrz/, which consists of:	+ Different consonants: r	+ Identical vowels: e (the single letter 'e')	+ Consonant(s) following the last vowel: z, which has no effect on the rhyming decision because it's not preceded or accompanied by another vowel.* "'bancshares'" ends with the sound /ʃərz/,
hyman, nex, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hyman" ends with the sound /nɛmən/, which has the same ending as the word "nex", which also ends with the sound /nek/. The vowels in both cases ("e") match, and so do the following consonantal sounds (/m/ vs. null or silent k). Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, they can indeed be considered rhymes.<|eot_id|>
macneal, deal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "macneal" and "deal" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound /l/. Although their spellings differ slightly ("-eal" vs "-nal"), this difference does not affect the phonetic similarity of the final syllables, which is what defines rhymes in English language poetry. In linguistic terms, we can say that despite having distinct letters (-e versus -n), the vowels and following consonantal
cod, zil, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "cod" and "zill" (or more accurately, "bil") do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /l/.* The preceding vowels in both words ("o" and "i") are distinct.* The initial consonants differ: "c-" vs "-b-".According to this analysis, we can conclude that "cod" and "zil" or "bil" share similar phonetic characteristics, making them rh
schlee, bruney, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The words "schlee" and "bruney" do not meet the criteria for rhyming because they don't share similar ending sounds.* In "schlee", there is no distinct vowel sound, as the letter combination "-ee" forms a diphthong (a gliding transition between two vowels).* Meanwhile, in "bruney", we see that both letters ("e") form separate individual vowel phonemes.To qualify as rhymes
smeal, reveal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "smeal" and "reveal" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "smeal" ends with the sound /l/, which is represented by the letters "L". The word "reveal", on the other hand, ends with the combination of vowels "/i/" (represented by the letter "I") and the consonantal sound "/v/", which together form the diphthong "/ivel".According to the rules for rhyming in English poetry
hille, instill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "hille" ends with the sound /le/, which consists of two distinct consonantal sounds (/l/) and one vocalic sound (the long e).* "instill" also ends with the same sequence: //, where "/s/" represents another distinct consonantal sound.* Since both sequences share the same final syllable structure -V-C- (), they can be considered rhyming based on their phonetic similarity.In conclusion, despite
shula, incase, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The two sets of letters "shu" in the word "shula-" share similar sound characteristics, with both ending in /l/. Similarly, the suffix "-case" also ends with the same phonetic sequence (/s/) as "/c". This suggests that they do indeed follow each other's patterns for rhyming purposes, making them eligible to qualify as having differing consonants followed by identical vowels and consonant sounds (i.e., CVC pattern).<|eot_id|>
easel, kain, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "easel" ends with the sound /l/.2. The word "kain" also ends with the same sound /n/, not /l/. However, since English does not typically use nasalized vowels (i.e., vowels pronounced while air escapes through the nose), we can consider both endings to represent distinct consonantal sounds.3. Despite having different final consonants (/l/ vs. /n/), they do share
schuler, postdating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schuler" ends with the sound /ər/, which consists of the letter combination "-er". The word "postdating" also ends with the same sound, specifically "/ˈpɒstdeɪtɪŋ/", where we can see that both words share the ending letters "ing", making them rhymable based on their shared final phonemes (/dætɪŋ/) being pronounced similarly to each other (i.e.,
cede, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "cede" ends with the sound /ed/, which is made up of the letter combination "e-d". Similarly, the word "jammer" also ends with the same sound /er/. Since they both share the same ending sound (/ed/) despite having different initial letters ("c-" vs "-j-"), we can conclude that their final syllables (the parts after the last vowel) do not differ in terms of vowels or following consonants. Therefore,
wills, stills, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "wills" ends with the sound /lz/, which is made up of the letters L-Z, whereas the word "stills" also ends with the same sound /lz/. This means that they both share similar ending phonemes (sounds), specifically differing only in their preceding consonantal elements (/w- vs./). According to linguistic criteria for rhyming, this similarity meets the condition where two or more words end with distinct but identical vowels-consonants
acid, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "acid" and "caen" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "acid" ends with the sound /id/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the voiced dental fricative /d/ and the voiceless alveolar stop /t/. On the other hand, the word "caen" also has multiple components in its final syllable: /nɛ̃ʃ/ (the nasalized open-mid back rounded vowel /�
kisling, caen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kising" has the sound /ɪŋ/, while "caen" ends with the sound /n/. Although they both end in -ing, their final consonantal sounds differ (g vs n). Additionally, although some may argue that English pronunciation is not always strictly phonetic or consistent across dialects, linguistically speaking, rhyming typically requires matching of distinct vocalic sounds following differing consonatal sequences. In this case, despite sharing similar
ikon, reasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ikon" ends with the sound /n/, which is also present at the end of the word "reaser". The vowels in both words ("i" and "e") are pronounced similarly, making them rhyming words according to the phonetic criteria you specified (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). However, please note that this analysis assumes English pronunciation standards and may vary depending on regional accents or dialects.<|eot_id|>
flair, canadair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "flaire" has the ending sound /er/, while the word "canadair" also ends with /er/. This means that they share similar final syllables, which is one way to determine if two words rhyme. Additionally, both words end in a single consonantal cluster (/r/) preceded by a long vowel (/"e"/), making them rhyming words according to traditional phonetic criteria for perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
affair's, care's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The final syllables of the two words, "air" in "affairs" and "are"s in "cares", both end with the same sound /ər/. This indicates that they share similar vowel-consonant combinations.* Additionally, the preceding consonantal sounds ("f-fs" vs. "c-c") differ from each other, which meets another criterion for rhyming: having distinct initial consonants before sharing identical vowel and
ohair, billionaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ohair" ends with the sound /er/, which is also present at the end of the word "billionaire". Although they may not seem to share similar endings, both words contain the same diphthong ("eh-") in their final syllables (/rɛr/ for "ohair", /ˈbjʊl.jən.aire/ for "billionaire"). This meets the criteria for rhyming as
olack, smullen, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "olack" ends with the sound /ək/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the schwa (/ə/) and the voiceless velar stop (/k). On the other hand, the word "smullen" also has a similar ending pattern - "/lɛn/", where we can identify three separate phones: voiced alveolar fricative (/l), low front rounded vowel (ʏ),and nasal (n).
akana, barrineau, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last syllables of both "akana" and "barrineau" end with distinct combinations of vowels and consonants, which meet the criteria for rhyming:* In "akana", we see -na (a combination of /n/, not pronounced as part of the preceding sound)* Similarly in "barrineau", we find -eu (again, /u/ isn't linked to any previous phoneme)Given this analysis,
bares, flares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "bares" ends with the sound /rz/, which has a distinct set of consonants (R) and vowels (/a/) compared to "flares", which also ends with the same combination of sounds, namely R-z(/arz/. This meets the criteria for rhyming as they share similar ending patterns despite having slightly differing initial phonemes ("b-" vs "-f-"). The key factor here being the presence of the unique sequence rz in both cases
pentair, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "pentair" ends with the sound /er/, which is composed of two distinct phonemes, namely the diphthong /eɪr/. On the other hand, the word "hare" also ends with the same sound /er/, consisting of another instance of the diphthong /eɯr/.Since both words end in the same sequence of vowels (/e/) and consonants (//), they do indeed share rhyming
zelia, brun, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "zelia" and "brun" do indeed share the same ending sound, which is "-n". This indicates that they may potentially rhyme as their final syllables exhibit similar phonetic characteristics (i.e., differing consonants preceded by matching vowels). To confirm this further, we can examine each word's individual components:* Zel- contains the diphthong /ɛl/, with no following consonants.* -a remains silent in English
reisenauer, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "reizenauer" ends with the sound /er/, which is made up of two distinct parts - a single vowel sound "/e/" and a double consonant sound "/r/. Similarly, the word "jama" also has the same ending "-ma", where there's one vowel sound "/"a"/ followed by another consonantal sound "/m/.In both cases, we can see that despite having slightly varying letters in between ("nau-" vs no intervening
skeel, peele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "skeel" and "peelle" do rhyme.Justification:In order to determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending phonemes (sounds). The last part of each word is crucial in determining whether they share similar sound patterns or not.The suffix "-lel-" appears at the end of both "skeel" and "peell". This sequence consists of three parts: /ɛ/, which represents a mid-front unrounded vowel
sheeler, jaimie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sheeler" and "Jamie" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "Sheeler" has distinct consonantal sound /lɛr/ (the 'er' ending), whereas Jamie ends with -mie having phonetic transcription as /miː/. Although both end in vowels (-e-/-i-e-) they don't share similar consecutive sounds making them non-rhyming pairs.<|eot_id|>
encase, prem, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "encase" and "prem" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "encase" ends with the sound /seɪs/, which has distinct consonantal values (the letter combination "/cs/" is pronounced as [ks]).* On the other hand, the word "prem" does not contain any vowels or consonants that would produce the same phonetic sequence.* Therefore, according to linguistic criteria for rhyming, where two syll
schueler, easily, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "schuler" has the ending sound /əlɛr/, which is pronounced as "uh-ler". On the other hand, the word "easily" ends with the sound /iːli/. Although they do not share exact matching letters in their spelling, both end-sounds (/eh-lēr/ vs. /ee-li/) can be considered rhyming because of the similar vowel-consonant combination at the end (ident
alair, whitehair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "alair" and "white-hair" can be broken down into their individual parts:* "Al-air" has the same ending sound /er/* "White-H-ai-r" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes, namely /r/Since both pairs share the same final vowels (/aɪ/) and consonantal endings (the nasalized liquid /r/, which is often transcribed as simply 'r'), they technically meet the
freels, neal's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "freel" and "neals" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The last syllables of both words ("reel" in "freel" and "eal"s) contain similar sounding vowels (the letter combination "-eel").2. Both syllables also end with distinct but matching consonantal sounds (/l/ in each case).According to this definition of rhyming, where two or more words share their final phonemes except for any intervening unst
beware, whitehair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beware" and "white hair" do not exactly rhyme.Justification: The word "beware" ends with the sound /are/, which has distinct consonantal sounds (/w/) preceding the same vowel sound (/ɛr/). On the other hand, the phrase "white hair" consists of two separate entities - "white", ending in /ait/ (different vowels), and "hair", ending in /er/. Although they share similar endings (-air/-
silsby, herronimo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "silb-y" ends with the sound /y/.* The suffix "-o-ni-m-o" in "herr-on-i-m-0" also contains the same vowel-consonant combination, specifically "/o/".* Although there might seem to be some differences between the two sequences of letters, when pronounced they both end up producing similar phonetic combinations: /ɪlbiː/ for "silb-y",
share's, repairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the last syllables of both "share" and "repairs" end with the same sound, which is /ɛrz/. The vowels in this case are pronounced as /eɪ/, but they still meet the criteria for rhyming since they follow the pattern: different consonants (s & r) + identical vowel (/a/) + similar or identical consonantal ending (rz). Therefore, based on phonological analysis, we can conclude that indeed
frere, voltaire, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "frère" (French for "brother") and "Voltaire" both end with the same sound /ɛr/. This is because they share similar phonetic patterns, where "/e/" represents the identical vowel sound in this case. Additionally, while their prefixes differ ("f-" vs. no prefix), the suffix "-re" remains consistent across both words. Therefore, based on the definition of rhyming as having distinct consonantal sequences preceding identical
oecd, scholer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "oecd" (pronounced as /ˈiːkd/) and "scholar" (/ʃəlɑr/) meet the criteria for rhyming:1. Different consonants:	* In "oecd", we see two distinct consonants, 'c' and 'd'.	* Similarly, in "scholar", there's one instance of '/sh/' combination, which is considered single phoneme.
flair, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "flair" ends with the sound /reɪr/, while the word "hare" also ends with the same sound, /er/. Although they differ in their initial consonants (/f/ vs. /h/) and final consonants (no additional consonents after /r/), both end with the same diphthongal vowel sound (-ere). Therefore, according to phonological criteria for rhyming, which involve matching of terminal syll
wille, gayshill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "wille" and "gay-shill" do rhyme.Justification:The word "wille" ends with the sound /le/, which is composed of the same vowels ("i") and final consonants (/l/) in both syllables.Similarly, the phrase "gays-hill" also has the same ending sound /il/. The consonants preceding each set of vowels (the letters "s", "h" respectively) differ from one another, but they
petrilli, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || **Yes**Justification: To determine if the two sets of words ("petrilli" and "rasner") rhyme, we need to examine their final syllables.* The last three letters in "petrilli" are "-ill-i", which contain distinct consonant sounds (/l/, /i/) as well as identical vowels (-i).* Similarly, for "rasner," its last four letters ("-ser-n-er") also consist of distinct consonant sounds (/s/, /
schul, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "schul" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant.* The word that rhymes, "bowron", also has its own unique sequence of vowels (no vowels in this case) and consonants (/rwn/) after the shared vowel-less ending "/b/".Since they share no common consonantal phoneme following their respective vowel-sounds ("u" vs none), we can conclude that they do not exactly match each
multimillionaire, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "multimillionaire" and "mare" do rhyme.Justification:The last syllables of both words ("re") share similar characteristics:* Different consonants: The initial consonant is distinct in each word (R vs LLN)* Identical vowels: Both end with the same sound /ɛːr/* Consonant sounds: Although not exactly alike (/mʊl.ti.mən ˈeɪriə
convair, canadair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three letters "ir" in both words ("convair" and "canadair") form rhyming pairs, as they share the same ending sound (/ɪr/) with no difference in vowels or preceding consonants. This meets the criteria for perfect rhyme. The only differences between them lie in their initial syllables (con- vs can-) which do not affect the final /ir/ phoneme pair responsible for creating this rhyme.<|eot_id|>
gahm, patrol, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "gahm" ends with the sound /əɡʰm/, which has the same vowel sound (/ə/) and distinct consonantal ending (-gh-m).* The word "patrol" also ends with the diphthongal sound /oʊrəl/, where we can identify two parts: (1) the monophthalic part "/oʏ/" having similar phonetic quality to the single
laack, jammu, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "laack" and "jammu" do not exactly match, but they come close to rhyming because of the similar ending sound /ak/. In phonetics, this is known as near-rhyme or imperfect rhyme. While there may be some variation in pronunciation depending on regional accents or individual speech patterns, both words share the same final syllable with distinct vowels (/a/) preceded by identical consonantal clusters (//k). This similarity makes them approximate
sowed, schiller, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sowed" and "Schiller" do not rhyme.Justification:The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.On the other hand, the name "Schiller" has two syllables: "Shi-" (which contains the same vowel as in "sow") + "-ler", where "/l/" is another consonant following this shared vowel.In rhyming terms, we require that both
ensnares, care's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ensnares" ends with the sound /sɛrəz/, which has the same vowel ("e") and final consonant (/rz/) as the word "care's", which also ends with the sound /seiz/. The difference lies in their initial consonants, where "ensnares" starts with "/n/" while "care's" begins with "/k/", but this does not affect the rhyming quality of the two
acid, priam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "acid" ends with the sound /id/, which has the same vowel (/i/) and following consonant ("d") as the suffix "-iam". The rhyming criterion of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds is met in this case, making them rhyming words.<|eot_id|>
mcnair, gisclair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "mcnair" ends with the sound /rɪər/* The word "gisclair" also ends with the same sound, which can be broken down into two parts: "/sklɛʳ/" (the silent "c", pronounced like a hard "k") + final "-R"Since both words end with the same sequence of phonemes (/r/, ɪ, æ), they do technically rhyme
beware, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "beware" ends with the sound /er/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the vowels /e/ and /r/. The word "mare", on the other hand, also ends with the same combination of sounds: /re/.In rhyming analysis, we look for similarities in both the final syllables' vocalic (vowel) parts as well as their non-vocalic (consonantal) components. Since both "
nationair, boisclair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "nation", "bois" (as in Clair-Bois), and "claire" all end with the same sound /er/. Additionally, they share similar vowels ("i" or "a") preceding those final consonantal sounds (/n/, /s/, and /r/ respectively). This meets the criteria for rhyming words to have different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds. Therefore, I conclude that indeed, these three words
o'shell, jammer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "o' shell" has the sound /ɔʃəl/, where the vowels are pronounced as /ɔː/ (long, open 'oh') and the final consonantal sound is /l/. On the other hand, the word "jammer" also ends with the same vowel-consonant combination, specifically /mər/ or /mr/. Since they share similar ending patterns (/ɔ˜-ml) that involve
sidey, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**The reason is that the ending "ey" in both "sidey" and "kissing" do not exactly match, despite having similar spellings.In linguistics, rhyming requires exact matching of phonemes (sounds) at specific positions within two or more words. In this case:* The final sound in "sidey" is /iː/ (long "ee"), whereas* The corresponding sound in "kissing" is /ɪŋ
lauck, germer, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the pair "lauck" and "germer", we can identify matching vowels ("u") and distinct consonants after those vowels, which defines rhyming according to linguistic standards. The final consonantal sound "-ck" matches with the ending "-r-" (note: this might also include some silent letters), satisfying the condition for perfect rhymes. Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed share similar phonological features characteristic of rhyming pairs.<|eot_id|>
hamann, breighner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hamann" and "breighner" do not rhyme.Justification:The reason is that they don't share similar ending sound patterns. The word "hamann" ends with "-n", while "breighner" ends with "-er". Although both words contain vowels ("a" in "hamann" and "i/e" in "breighner"), their final consonant-vowel combinations differ (/-nn/ vs /-r"). This difference dis
boudreaux, denault, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "boud" in Boudreaux has the same ending sound /uːz/ (the letter combination "ou" making this single phoneme).2. The word "denault" also ends with the same sounding sequence, specifically /ɛnəlt/, which can be broken down into:	* The diphthong /eɪ/ ("ei") representing the letters "en"	* A silent or
goodwill, gayshill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "goodwill" ends with the sound /ɪl/, which consists of the vowels "/i/" (the short "i" in "hit") and the consonantal liquid sound "/l/. The word "gayshill", on the other hand, also ends with the same sequence: "/əʃil/", where "/ə/" is a neutral vowel sound similar to the unstressed "a" in "about," and again we see the consonatal liquid sound "/
necaise, rasner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that "necase" (in the word "necaise") has the same ending sound as "raser" in "Rasnser". The last two letters ("se" or "raser") form a rhyming pair, meeting the criteria of having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
st_claire, mair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "st-claire" and "m-air" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with distinct consonantal sounds ("r" in this case) preceded by identical vowels ("i"). This similarity in sound is what defines perfect rhymes or exact matches between two words' ending syllables. Therefore, I conclude that yes, these words technically rhyme according to phonological standards of English language pronunciation.<|eot_id|>
keeney, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "keeney" and "castings" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "keeney" ends with the sound /ee/, whereas the word "castings" ends with the sound /ɪŋz/. Although they both contain vowels (/e/) in their final syllables, the following consonantal sounds differ (/"n"/ vs. /ʒ/), which is one of the criteria for determining rhyming pairs. Therefore, based
chance, stance, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "chance" and "stance" do indeed rhyme.Justification: The final syllables of both words ("nce") share the same vowels (/ɑː/) and similar consonantal sound combinations (the /nʃ/ cluster). This meets the criteria for rhyming in English poetry and linguistics. Therefore, I conclude that they form perfect rhymes.<|eot_id|>
geared, appeared, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. The word "geared" ends with the sound /rd/.2. The word "appeared" also ends with the same sound /rd/.Since both words end with the same ending, which includes distinct consonants (/r/) preceded by identical vowels (the 'e' in this case) and following consonants ('d'), they do indeed share similar rhyming characteristics according to phonetic rules of English language pronunciation. Therefore, I conclude that
zell, kearn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "zell" ends with the sound /ɛl/* "kern" also ends with the same sound /ərn/Since they both end with the same vowel-consonant combination (/ər/) despite having different initial consonants, we can conclude that "zell" and "kern" do indeed rhyme according to the criteria of rhyming defined in linguistics: differing consonants preceding identical vowel-consonant combinations (CVC
shelor, rossin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "shelor" ends with the sound /ɒr/, which has a short 'o' (vowel) followed by the letter combination "R".* The word "rossin" also ends with the same sound /ɒzɪn/. Although there's no exact match in spelling, both end with similar phonetic values: short 'o', then distinct consonantal ending ("R" vs "Z+N").Based on
grope, cope, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "grope" ends with the sound /ope/, which consists of two distinct phonemes: the voiced alveolar stop /p/ (the same one in "pat") and the diphthong /oʊ/.* Similarly, the word "cope" also ends with the sound /ope/, consisting again of the voiceless bilabial plosive /k/ (as in "cat") and the aforementioned diph
frill, mcgill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "frill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has the same vowels ("i") but different consonants (/r/) compared to the ending of the word "McGill", which is pronounced as `/məgˈʌɪl`. The final part "/il/" in both cases share similar phonetic features, meeting the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants (in this case, /f
ceder, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ceder" ends with the sound /rɛdər/, which has the same ending as the word "healthy", namely "/iːθli/" (the double letters represent distinct phonemes). The only difference lies in their initial consonantal sounds, where "c" appears before the vowels in "ceder", whereas "h" does so in "healthy". Despite this distinction, both final parts of each word share similar vocalic
oecd, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "oecd" ends with the sound /d/, while the word "Köhn" (pronounced as "kern") also has its own unique ending, which is not exactly similar to "/d". However, if we consider only the final vowels (/eɪ/) in both words, they share the same phonetic value, making them rhyming according to their shared V-Consonant pattern. Therefore, I conclude that yes, the two
macdill, gayshill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last syllables of "mac-dill" and "gay-shill" both end with the same sound /əl/, which consists of the vowels "/ɛ/" (a schwa) and the consonantal liquid "/l/", making them rhyming in terms of their phonetic characteristics, specifically having different consonants ("m-c", "g-y") but sharing similar vowel-consonant combinations (/ɛl/) at the end.<|eot_id|>
cedar, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "cedar" ends with the sound /r/, whereas the name "Highman" has no similar ending, as its final syllable is "-an". Although they share some similarities in their pronunciation (e.g., both contain vowels), the distinct differences in their consonantal endings prevent them from rhyming according to linguistic conventions of perfect rhyme.In linguistics, when considering whether two words rhyme or not, we typically examine if they end with the same
kearny, bryna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "kearny" and "bryana" (or "Brynna") meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound "/ɪnə/" which is composed of the vowels /iː/, /n/, and /ʌ/. This matches the definition of perfect rhymes or exact homophones in linguistics. In phonetics, this would be represented as KER-ny and BRY-n
convair, compare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "convair" and "compare" do rhyme.Justification:The word "convair" ends with the sound /er/, which is pronounced as a single syllable (kənˈvɛr). The word "compare", on the other hand, also ends with the same sound combination of /eR/. Both words share similar phonetic characteristics:* Different initial consonants: 'c' in "comp-" vs. 'con-' in "
leake, gemme, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "leake" ends with the sound /k/, whereas the word "gemme" (which is likely meant to refer to "gemma", not its correct pronunciation) would end with the diphthong /ɛm/. Since they don't share similar vowels or consonant patterns, they do not technically rhyme according to phonological criteria for rhyming in English language.<|eot_id|>
scholer, knicks', Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "scholar" ends with the sound /ər/, which has the same vowel sound (/ɛ/) as in the suffix "-er". The next letter, or consonant sound, after this vowel sound is also the same: "/l/" (the final consonantal part of both "scholar" and "knicker"). Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming, having different initial letters but sharing similar ending sounds.<|eot_id|>
veal, neel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "veal" has the sound /vɛl/, which consists of the vowels "/e/" (short e) and the consonantal ending "/l/. On the other hand, the word "neel" also has the same sound pattern `/nēl`, with the short e as its first vowel and again "/l/". As both words end in the same combination of letters (/le/) after their respective initial vowels (/e/), they meet the
finnair, belair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the words "FinnAir" and "Bel Air" meet the criteria for rhyming:1. Different initial consonants: F/B2. Identical vowels: ai in both cases (the double 'i' can be considered as one single instance of the letter)Since they share this characteristic, we consider them to rhyme.<|eot_id|>
beware, repair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "beware" and "repair" do indeed rhyme.Justification:The rhyming criterion is that they share similar phonetic patterns in their final syllables:1. In both words, we find distinct consonantal sounds: /r/, which appears before identical vowels (/e/) and subsequent consonantal sounds.2. The combination of this sequence (different consonants + same vowel + same consonants) meets our definition for rhything pairs.Therefore, based on
enex, conn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "enex" ends with the sound /eks/, which has the same ending as the word "conn", also pronounced as /kon/. The difference lies in their initial letters: 'n' vs '.c'. However, since they share similar final phonemes (/ks/) despite having distinct beginning segments, we can consider them to rhyme according to the standard definition of rhyming words in English poetry and linguistics.<|eot_id|>
sudd, koehn, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sudd" ends with the sound /d/, which is a consonant, while the last part of the word "koehn" (assuming you meant to write "Koehen") has the same ending as in German names like Koehler or Koenig, where "-en" represents a suffix that changes its pronunciation when attached to other letters but keeps this specific diphthong ("oi"). In phonetics, we can describe those two parts
mcgill, waddill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "mcGILL" ends with the sound /l/.* The word "wADDIL" also ends with the same sequence of phonemes: /d/, then double vowels ("a") which can be considered to represent one single long-vowel sound, finally ending in "/L".* Since both end-sequences share similar patterns (different consonants before identical vowel-consonant sounds), we conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to linguistic
schaal, berna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "schall" (or more accurately, the German word "Schaal") ends with the sound /ɑːl/, which is pronounced like the English combination of "ah-l". Similarly, the name "Bernhard" or simply "Ber-na", has its final syllable ending in -rna-, also pronounced as two distinct phonemes (/rən-/). Since they both end with differing consonantal sequences (-ll vs. -rn)
boren, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "boren" and "jamb" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the sound /n/* The vowels in both words ("o" and "a") follow each other* Although they don't share any consecutive consonants (the initial letters being distinct), their ending consonants (-rn- and -mb-) can still produce similar phonetic effects when spoken together.Therefore, based on this analysis of rhyming criteria, I conclude
dore, thor, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "dore" and "thor" do indeed rhyme.Justification:* Both words end with the same sound /r/* The vowels preceding the final consonant cluster ("o" in both cases) share similar phonetic characteristics (i.e., they belong to the front-mid class of English vowels)* Although there's no exact match for every single detail between their respective syllable structures or stress patterns, this is not necessary for rhyming; what matters
downhill, courville, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "downhill" ends with the sound /ill/2. "courville" also ends with the sound /ille/Although they differ in their initial consonantal sequence, both end with the same combination of vowels (-ile) which makes them rhyming words according to the criteria you specified (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds).<|eot_id|>
mairs, millionaire's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "mairs" ends with the sound /s/* The word "millionaire"s (note: I assume you meant to write "millions", not "millionaires") has two possible endings:	+ If we consider the entire phrase, then it would end in -s	+ However, if we focus on the last syllable of the main part ("mil-lion-air-"), which carries the rhyming potential,
shula, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "Shula" ends with the sound /ul/.2. "Summerin" (I assume you meant to write "summering") also ends with the sound /ilng/.Since both end with distinct vowels (/u/) and following consonant combinations, they technically meet the criteria for rhyming in English poetry or music. However, please note that perfect homophones might not always share exactly same pronunciation due to regional accents, dialects
yoe, gauthreaux, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "yoe" ends with the sound /oʊ/* The suffix "-gau-" in "Gauthreaux" also has the same ending, which can be broken down into two parts: "/ɡə/" (the diphthong) and then "/ˈaʊ/" (which matches the final part of the original /oʊ/)* Since both end with similar sounding vowels (/oʊ
saudi, litigating, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "saudi" and "litigating" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "saudi" ends with the sound /di/, which is pronounced as a single syllable (dih). On the other hand, the suffix "-gating" in "litigating" has two distinct parts - "/tɪ/" and then "/eɪtɪŋ"/. Although both end with similar sounding vowels (/i/) and consonants (/
acid, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "acid" ends with the sound /id/, which is a combination of the vowel sound "/i/" (long e) and the consonantal sound "/d/. On the other hand, the word "bored" also has the same ending as "-or-ed", where the final consonant is indeed "/d/", following the vowel sound "/o:/". Since both end in similar patterns (/id/) and (/od/), they can be considered to rhym
compares, fair's, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "compares" ends with the sound /sɛrz/, which has the same final vowels (/e/) as well as similar consonantal ending sounds (both end in -rs). The word "fair"s also ends with the sound /færz/. Although they differ slightly, both share the same phonetic pattern of having distinct initial consonants (-c- vs -f-) but matching subsequent vowel-consonant combinations (/er-s/), thus
guertin, roesner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "guertin" ends with the sound /tin/, which consists of two distinct consonants (t-n) preceded by one vowel.* "roesner" also ends with the sound /er/, which again has two distinct consonants (r-r) preceded by one vowel.Since both ending combinations differ in their final consonantal sequence, they do not share identical vowels and consonant sounds to qualify as rhyming pairs according to traditional phon
sighed, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **NO**Justification: The word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is not identical to any of the letters in "kissing". In order for two words to rhyme, they need to share similar or exact phonetic patterns at their terminal syllables (i.e., ending parts). Since there's no matching sequence of vowels and consonants between "sighed" and "kissing", we can conclude that they do not technically rhyme according to linguistic definitions.
props, copps, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "props" and "copps" both end with the "-ops" sound, which is considered to be rhyming because they share similar vowel-consonant combinations (the letters "o-p-s"). This meets one of the criteria for perfect rhymes in English poetry, where two or more words that have the same ending sound but differ only in their initial letter(s) can be classified as having matching phonemes. In this case, while there may not
sowed, necaise, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/ (a consonant) followed by the vowels "o" and another silent letter combination ("w", which doesn't affect pronunciation).* The second part of your query, "necaise", seems to contain multiple errors or typos; I'll assume you meant either "nice ease" or simply "niece". If we consider only one option:	+ For "nic-ease
creal, reveal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "creal" ends with "-real", which has the same ending sound as the word "reveal". The vowels in both words ("e") follow similar consonantal sequences, making them rhyming words according to phonetic rules of English language pronunciation. Specifically:* Cereal (creal) ends with /rɛl/* Reveal ends with /riːvəl/Both pairs share the identical vowel-consonant combination (/
hille, lille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hille" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which has the same ending as the word "lille", also pronounced as /lɪl/. The two-syllable pattern of both words, where each syllable starts with a distinct consonantal phoneme (in this case, "/h/" in "hille" vs. no initial consonant in "lille"), does not affect their rhyming quality since they share
shirlee, jam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "shirlee" and "jam" do indeed meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (-ee) in their final syllables (le-ee). Although there may seem to be some differences between them at first glance due to distinct starting letters ("Sh-" vs "-J"), this does not affect the overall similarity of their ending vowels and following consonants, which is what defines true rhymes. Therefore, I conclude
switch, tritch, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "switch" ends with the sound /tʃɪt͡ʃ/, which consists of the same vowels (/i/) and distinct consonants (the voiceless postalveolar fricative /tʃ/). The word "tritch", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /rɪt͡ʃ/. Although they differ in their initial consonantal phonemes, both end with the identical combination of
cod, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "cod" ends with the sound /d/, while the suffix "-carb-ons" in "chlorofluorocarbons" has the same ending consonant /ns/. The vowels preceding them, however, differ: "o"d vs. "o", respectively. Therefore, according to phonological rules of rhyming, they do not perfectly match (different initial consonants). However, considering only the final syllables ("-od" and "-ons"), we
guyton, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "guyton" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowels "o", then another consonant "/t". Similarly, the name "Jimmy" also has three parts - two vowels ("i") followed by one consonant (/m/y). Since both end with distinct combinations of consonants (different in this case) plus matching vowels and final consonants, they can be considered rhyming words according to linguistic rules
risner, jamb, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "riser" has the ending sound /ɪzər/, which consists of two parts: 1) The final consonantal part is "/rz/" (different), and 2) The preceding vocalic part is "/i/" (identical). Similarly, the word "jamber" also ends with the sound /æmbr/, consisting of: 1) Final consonantal part "/mb/" (different from "/rz/") and 2) Preced
clare, hare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that in the word "clare", we see the sound combination /kler/, where "/l/" is a consonant, and then "/er" which has two vowels with no intervening consonent. In contrast, for the second part of your query ("hare"), we also observe the same pattern: the sequence of phonemes being /hɛr/. Both sequences end on similar diphthongs (/ə/) - essentially indistinguishable from each other when considering only
lill, waddill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "lill" and "waddill" do rhyme.Justification: The word "lill" ends with the sound /ɪl/, which has the same ending as the word "waddill", which also ends with the sound /ɪl/. This is because both words share the same vowels (/i/) and similar consonantal endings (-ll). In phonetics, this would classify them as having perfect rhyming qualities due to their matching V-C
enex, boerner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "enex" ends with the sound /eks/, which consists of two distinct consonants (n and x) followed by a single vowel sound (/e/) and another consonant sound (/ks/).* The word "boerner" also has three parts: a silent initial b, then the letter combination "-oer", finally ending in -ner.	+ In this case, we can break down the final part "/-ner/"
zulu, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "zulu" ends with the sound /uːlʊ/, which consists of two syllables, where "/ul/" is the diphthong that represents both distinct vowels (the first one being pronounced like in "put", and the second one like in "full") as well as a single consonantal component (/l/). On the other hand, the name "Jimmie" can be broken down into three parts: "Jim-"
scholey, highman, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "scholey" and "Highman" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "scholey" ends with the sound /iː/ (long e) while "highman" ends with the diphthong /aɪ/. Since they don't share similar ending vowels or consonantal sounds, they cannot be considered rhyming words according to linguistic criteria for perfect rhymes in English poetry. Perfect rhymes require that two syllables end
care, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "care" and "prepare" do indeed rhyme.Justification:1. The final syllable of both words is pronounced with the same sound: /er/.2. Both words end in -are, which means they share the same ending.3. Since there's no difference between their vowels or consonants (both being 'r' after the shared '-ar-' prefix), we can conclude that they meet the criteria for rhyming.According to phonetic rules,
aside, coiner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "aside" ends with the sound /aid/, which has the same vowels (/a/) but different consonants (/d/ vs /n/) as compared to the ending "/ainer" of the word "coiner". Therefore, they do not exactly match in terms of their final syllable's phonetic characteristics, failing the criteria for rhyming. However, some might argue that they share similar sounds or near-rhyme due to the presence of the shared '/i/'
plair, repair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "plair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which consists of the vowel sound /ɪ/ (short 'i') followed by the consonantal sound /r/.* The word "repair" also ends with the same sequence: /reɪpər/. It has the long-vowel sound /eɪ/ ('ay' like in 'play'), but this still counts towards having identical vowels.
ohair, mare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "ohair" ends with the sound /rɪər/, which consists of the vowels "/ɪ/" (the same as in "hit") and "/ʌ/" (a schwa), followed by the consonantal sound "/r". The word "mare", on the other hand, also ends with the sound /reɪr/. Both endings share the identical vowel and consonant sounds: "/eɪ/" for both,
macneal, veal, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "macneal" ends with the sound /lel/, which consists of two distinct consonants ("L") followed by a single, repeated vowel sound (/e/) and another consonant (/"L"/). Similarly, the word "veal" also ends with the same sequence - /el/. Since they share similar ending patterns in terms of vowels and consonants, we can conclude that "macneal" and "veal" do indeed rhyme according to linguistic
thence, spence, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "thence" ends with the sound /ns/, which has a distinct set of consonants (n, s).* "spence" also ends with the sound /ns/, which again has a similar sequence of consonants (s, n).Since both words end with different consonants (/n/) but share the same vowel-consonant combination (-ne), they do not technically rhyme in English phonetics rules. However, for practical purposes,
ideal, daneel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ideal" ends with the sound /l/, which is a consonant, followed by the diphthong "i-e", where both vowels ("i" and "e") share similar qualities (front unrounded) but not exactly same phonetic value. On the other hand, the suffix "-danel-" in "Daneel" also has a distinct ending of /L/. Since they do not match perfectly regarding their final consonantal sequence (/l
wille, mcgill, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "wille" and "mcgill" meet the criteria for rhyming, as they both end with the same sound (/il/) which is made up of a single syllable with two distinct parts:- Consonant(s): /l/- Vowel + Consistent sound: /i/The similarity in their ending sounds suggests that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
bryner, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "brynér" ends with the sound /rɛmər/, which has different consonants (R, M) preceded by the same vowels ("e", pronounced as in "pet"). Similarly, the word "gérmée" also ends with the sound /ʒermei/, where we see distinct consonants (/j/) before similar vowel-consonant combinations ("e", again like in "pet").In both cases, there
sighed, excelling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "sighed" and "excelling" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "sighed" ends with the sound /d/, which is a distinct consonantal ending.* On the other hand, the word "excelling" has two consecutive syllables: ex-cell-ing. In this case:	+ The first syllable ("excel") ends with the diphthongal combination of vowels (ɛksəl), where
gents, events, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "gents" ends with the sound /nts/, which is made up of two distinct consonantal sounds (/n/ and /t/) followed by the same vowel sound (the neutral schwa vowel, often represented as /ə/). On the other hand, the suffix "-events" also has a similar structure, ending in /ts/, where again we see separate consonantal sounds (/v/ and /s/) preceded by the same vowel sound (/e�
kearny, castings, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "kearny" ends with the sound /iːnɪ/, which consists of the same vowel sound (/i/) followed by two distinct consonantal sounds (/r/, then /n,). Similarly, the word "castings" also has this pattern - "/ɪŋzɪs/" contains the same vowel sound (/i/) preceded by three consecutive consonental sounds (/k/, then /st/, finally /z,).Since
kissling, health, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "kissling" and "health" do not rhyme.Justification: To determine if two words rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns. In this case:* The word "kissling" ends with "-ing", which has the letter combination /ɪŋ/.* The word "health" ends with "-th", which has the distinct letters /θ/.Since they don't share similar final consonant-vowel-consonant combinations (/s
care, pentair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "care" ends with the sound /are/, which has the same vowel (/a/) and consonant (//r) as the suffix "-pent-air". Since they share the same ending, including both vowels and consonants, we can conclude that they do indeed rhyme according to the standard definition of rhyming in English poetry and linguistics.<|eot_id|>
grill, dille, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "grill" ends with the sound /lɪl/, which consists of two distinct phonemes, "/g/" (consonantal) + "/r/", ("/i") as in "hit", and finally "/L"/(liquid). On the other hand, the suffix "-dille" can be broken down into three parts: "/di/" (/j/) is similar to the "y" sound at the end of "myth"; then comes
savill, jheel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "sav" in "savill" has the same sound as "hel" in "jheel".* The vowels "i" and "e" also match, having similar pronunciations.* However, after each of those vowels comes distinct consonantal sounds: "l" (in "savill") vs. "l" or sometimes pronounced like "h+l" combination (in "jheel").	+ In phonetics notation (/),
kain, bowron, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || **Answer: No**Justification:To determine if the words "kain" and "bowron" rhyme, we need to examine their ending sound patterns.* The word "kain" ends with the phonetic sequence /n/, which is represented as -in.* The word "bowron" also has multiple syllables (bo-wro-n), but its final part "-on" can be simplified into a single unit of /ɑːn/.Accordingly,1
hyman, healthy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "hyman" ends with "-an", which has the same vowel sound as "/i/" (the long e in "he") and follows this consonant sequence: /m/. On the other hand, the word "healthy" also ends with "-y" or more specifically "/tʰɪli/", but when ignoring the silent letter "h", we get "/tiːlɪ/", where again there's no difference between vowels ("
ocon, braner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "ocon" has the sound /ɒn/, which is pronounced as "on", while the suffix "-braner" ends with the sound /rənər/. Although they don't share exact spelling, their phonetic pronunciation matches (identical vowels) - both end in the nasalized diphthongal sound (/ɔ̃/) and the same final consonantal cluster (-nr-). This meets the criteria for rhyming
huguet, borneo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The words "huguet" and "borneo" do not perfectly match the traditional definition of rhyming, which requires that they share the same ending sound (consonant + vowel). However, if we consider phonetic similarity rather than exact matching, both words end with the /uː/ diphthong or similar close-mid back rounded vowels (/ʊ/) in their final syllables ("-ue-t" vs "-eo"). Additionally,
vanheel, keel, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the last three letters "eel" in both "vanheal" and "keel" share the same sound, which meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants (in this case, initial vowels) but similar or identical vowel-consonant combinations ("eel"). Therefore, I conclude that they do indeed rhyme.<|eot_id|>
gumm, reierson, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "gum" has a distinct sound of /m/ at its end, while the name "Reierson" ends with the phonetic combination "/son", which consists of two separate sounds (/s/) and (n). Although both sequences contain vowels ("u") and consonants ("m"/"s"), they do not share identical vowel-consonant combinations to qualify as rhyming in English language standards. Therefore, I conclude that the pair does
agerton, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "agerton" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant.* The last part of "zulli" also has two letters, but they form a single unitized phoneme (the digraph "/ll/") that behaves like one consonantal sound in rhyming terms.* Both parts end with vowels: "on" from "agerton" and "i" from "zulli".* Since both ending sequences
hohman, summerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "hohman" and "Summerlin" do not rhyme.Justification:* The word "hohman" ends with the sound /mɑn/, which has distinct consonant sounds (/h/) and vowels (/"o"/).* The surname "Summerlin", on the other hand, ends with the sound /lɪn/, which also has distinct consonant sounds (/r$/) and vowels (/"u"/).Since they don't share similar
shelor, easel, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "shenor" ends with the sound /or/, which is preceded by two distinct consonants, /l/. Meanwhile, the word "easel" also ends with the same sound /or/, but this time preceded only by one consonant, /z/. Since they share similar ending vowels/consonants (/or/) despite having differing initial consonants(/l/ vs /z/), we can conclude that indeed, "sheloreaseal" do
shirlee, khanna, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the ending "ee" in both "Shirlee" and "Khanna" has the same sound, which means they share the same vowels (both being pronounced as /iː/) and similar consonantal endings (/lēnna/). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but matching final vowel-consonant combinations.<|eot_id|>
ceder, boren, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* "Cedar" ends with the sound /r/* "Boreden" (assuming you meant to type "borend", not "born") also ends with the sound /n/However, if we consider that in English pronunciation, sometimes the letter combination "-ed" can represent a silent or modified form of the original ending ("-er"), then:	+ In this case:         * The word "cedar" has its
born, primo, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "born" ends with the sound /n/, which is a consonant, followed by the vowel sound /ɔr/. On the other hand, the suffix "-primo" has no distinct ending; however, when combined with its preceding vowels ("i"), we can analyze them as having the same vowel sound (/ɪ/) that appears in both words before their respective endings (-rn). Since they share similar vocalic components (different consonants but matching vowel
keen, bruner, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "keen" ends with the sound /n/, which is also present in the second syllable of the word "brunner", making them rhyming. The difference lies only in their vowel sound, not in any subsequent consonantal phonemes. Therefore, they technically meet the criteria for having different consonants followed by identical vowels and ending with similar consonental sounds (the final nasal stop /n/) to qualify as rhymes.<|eot_id|>
schlee, iacona, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || NO.The reason is that the provided sequence "schlee-iacona" does not meet the criteria for rhyming, which requires having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds at their end. The letters in this combination do not share similar sound patterns to qualify as rhymes. Additionally, some of them ("s", "c") represent distinct phonemes (units of speech) whereas others("i", "a","o") form separate categories within vowels or diphth
whitehair, blair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "white" ends with the sound /t/, which is followed by the identical vowel sound "/ai/" (in this case, both being pronounced as long vowels) in the suffix "-hair". Similarly, the word "blair" also has the same ending pattern: the final letter combination "-ir" represents the consonantal sequence of two instances of the voiceless alveolar fricative /r/. The shared feature here lies within their phonetic representations
veal, peele, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "veal" ends with the sound /l/, which is a distinct consonantal ending, while the word "peel" also has this same final consonantal sound (/l/) along with matching vowels "/e/" in both cases. This fulfills the criteria for rhyming words as they share similar phonetic properties at their end points.<|eot_id|>
stares, bancshares', Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is that the word "stares" ends with the sound /sɛrəz/, which has the same ending as the word "'bancshares", namely, -ers (different consonants) + identically pronounced vowels (-are-). This meets the criteria for rhyming: having different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds.<|eot_id|>
sowed, jimmy, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "sowed" ends with the sound /d/, which is followed by the same vowels "/o/" as in "Jimmy". Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming (different consonants followed by identical vowel and consonant sounds). In this case, both words end with the diphthong ""io"". This similarity makes them rhyme.<|eot_id|>
game, zulli, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes, the words "game" and "zuli" do not rhyme.Justification: The word "game" ends with the sound /ame/, which has the same vowels ("a") but different consonants (/m/) compared to the word "zulli", which does not exist in English language (it seems like you made up this non-existent word). Since they don't share similar ending patterns of letters that make distinct sounds, they cannot be considered rhyming words according to linguistic
fare, unaware, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "fare" ends with the sound /are/, which is made up of the letter combination "ar". The word "unaware" also has this same ending, "-are", making them rhyming words. Both end in the sequence of differing consonants (F/un) followed by the identical vowels (-a-) and then another set of consonants (-re). This meets the criteria for perfect rhymes in English poetry and music. Therefore, I conclude that yes, they
gautney, kissling, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:1. "Gautney" ends with the sound /ni/.2. "Kissing" (not Kissling, I assume that's a typo) also ends with the sound /ing/, which can be broken down into /iŋ/.Since both end-sequences ("ni" in Gautney and "/iŋ/" in Kissing) contain different consonants (/n/ vs. /g/) but share the same final vowels ('i
doctrinaire, compare, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "doctrinaire" ends with the sound /aire/, which is pronounced as "air". The word "compare" also ends with the same sound, "/are/", which is again pronounced as "air".Since both words end with the same vowel-consonant combination ("-aire"), they technically do not meet the criteria for rhyming because of having different initial consonants (/d/ in "doctrinaire", /c/ in "compare"). However, phonetically
schul, jimmie, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The word "schul" ends with the sound /l/, which is then followed by the same vowel sound as in "jim-mie", namely, /i/. Therefore, they meet the criteria for rhyming: having different initial consonants but sharing the same final vowels and ending consonant (in this case, both end with the /-il/- sequence). Justification: The phonetic transcription of each word's last syllable reveals that their endings share similar patterns:
seader, hannam, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.Justification: The word "seader" ends with the sound /er/, which is made up of the vowels "/e/" and the consonant "/r/", whereas the word "hannam" also ends with the same sequence, namely "/" + "/a"/+ "/m"". This satisfies the criteria for rhyming in English poetry where two words end with the same phonemes (distinctive units) at their final syllables. In this case, both words share similar ending
haggart, chlorofluorocarbons, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The reason is that the ending sound of "haggart" (-t) does not match with the ending sounds in "-chloro-", "-fluoro-" or "-carbons". In rhyming, usually we look for perfect matching between final vowels and consecutive consonants (VCC pattern). Here:* The last three letters ("-g-a-r-t") do not appear at all in "chlore", "flure", or "cars".* Although there's some
fares, impairs, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "fares" ends with the sound /s/.* The word "impairs" also ends with the same sound /rs/, which can be considered equivalent to the single sound /s/.Accordingly, both words end with similar consonantal endings (-rs/s) that correspond to distinct but matching vocalic components (the 'a' in "fares" matches the 'i' in "impares"). This meets the criteria for rh
herminie, zele, Gold: 0, Pred: 1 || Yes.The justification is as follows:* The word "hermine" ends with the sound /ine/, which has the same vowels ("i") and final consonant (/n/) in both parts.* Similarly, the word "zelé" (I assume you meant to write this instead of "zele", since there's no such thing as a single-syllable "zele") also ends with the diphthongal sound /eɪl/. This contains the same
