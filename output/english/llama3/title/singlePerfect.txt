upstairs, bares, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  Yes. The first two syllables of the word “stairs” is pronounced /eɪs/, which rhymes with “bears.” Both are examples of what we call open front vowels, and they have no consonant sounds between them.
When you pronounce each sound in isolation (as I did above), it’s easier to hear that there isn’t any difference between how people say those vowel pairs when compared against other similar-sounding sets such as: [i:] ice-ice; or
reasner, jama, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  A: They do. The only difference is that the first word has an "er" sound at its end and the second one ends with "-ing." (See below.) [PAUSE 3 SECONDS]
Q: How can you tell if two rhyming lines are in different syllable counts?
A: If they have more than three or four extra letters, it's probably not going to be exact.
For example, let me say this line:

As you can see I am using bracketing instructions on my own poem here. And as far as brackets go they are not always necessary when writing poetry but it sure helps sometimes.
Now let's take another look at some of those poems again:

heman, noxso, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 ||  [INST] Do you know what this word means? 1. nectar- sweet food made by insects from flower sap; used as the source of honey and beeswax, or to attract pollinating animals (n) 2. noxious-pertaining to something that is injurious or harmful in some way: poisonous plants are considered dangerous because they're so noxious (/adjective/) 3. oxen-a large bovine animal which has been domesticated for centuries throughout much

[CORRECTING] It's only clair.
[GISECLAIR-PREPARE]
Yes. And I think that this will be very important to you because when we say rhymes like "sis-clare," if they don't have any other sound within those two syllables--I mean no consonants between each vowel as well as nothing else except

belaire, ohair, Gold: 1, Pred: 1 ||  No. [INST]
Do they have the same number of syllables?
Yes, both are three-syllable rhymes.
Does each word end in one or more vowels followed by consonants?
No; ohair ends with two vowel sounds: /o/ and then /\(\ae\)/.
Is there any other difference between them that you can hear when spoken aloud?
They sound very different because their final diphthongs differ so much from one another:

2. In the case of a near-perfect or imperfect (partial) rhymes, we would want to know what is missing from one word that causes it not to be an exact match for another.
3. The first two examples above are partial and incomplete; they're close but don't quite fit perfectly in all respects. It's important here too--as when you do this with poetry yourself --to understand how far apart your choices may fall short before
depuy, markee, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 ||  The first word has two syllables and the second one also. So, they’re both iambic.
Now let’s try another pair of rhyming words:

Are those words perfectly matched in terms of their sounds?

No! Because when you say ‘I am’, it takes more than 2 beats to pronounce that whole phrase but only one beat for “‘Im”.
