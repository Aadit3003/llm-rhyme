kearny, sumerlin, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, "Kearny Summit" and "Sumerlin" do not form a perfect rhyme. "Kearny Summit" rhymes with "disco" and "shmo," while "Sumerlin" does not form a rhyme at all.

gisclair, prepare, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, "gisclair-prepare" does not form a perfect rhyme. The "g" and "c" sounds are not close enough in terms of pitch and loudness, making it an imperfect rhyme.
keeney, electoral, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, "keeney-electoral" does not form a perfect rhyme. The two words slightly rhyme with each other, with "electoral" slightly rhyming with "keeney." A perfect rhyme would have words that sound exactly the same or nearly the same when spoken.

scholl, germe, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, "scholl" and "germe" do not form a perfect rhyme. There are no pure rhyming pair of words with the same number of sounds that begin and end with the same two syllables that can be combined without changing or adding letters. Additionally, the fourth syllable "me" in "germe" has a different vowel sound than the syllables before it, which breaks the rhyme.
sowed, enix, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, "sowed-enix" does not form a perfect rhyme. The second and fourth syllable ("o" and "e") of "sowed" and "nex" are both short, while the first and third syllable ("s" and "aw") are long. This creates an off-rhythm and breaks the perfect rhyme.
sawed, brony, Gold: 0, Pred: 0 || No, "sawed-brony" does not form a perfect rhyme. The sounds "a" and "e" are not closed off at the end of each phonetic sound in "sawed" and "brony." Instead, "o" and "y" are closed off, resulting in an imperfect rhyme.
courville, drill, Gold: 1, Pred: 0 || No, "Courville" and "drill" do not form a perfect rhyme. "Courville" rhymes with "mour," while "drill" rhymes with "sil," "plink," or "plonk."
